section in Nigeria’s criminal code.  This specific type of scam is generally referred to as the Nigerian scam because of its prevalence in that country.  Such schemes typically involve promising the victim a significant share of a large sum of money, in return for a small up-front payment, which the fraudster claims to require in order to cover the cost of documentation, transfers, etc.  Frequently, the sum is said to be lottery proceeds or personal/family funds being moved out of a country by a victim of an oppressive government, although many types of scenarios have been used.  This scheme is perpetrated globally through email, fax, or mail.  Anti-Money Laundering/Combating the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT):  Collective term used to describe the overall legal, procedural, and enforcement regime countries must implement to fight the threats of money laundering and terrorism financing.  Bearer Share:  A bearer share is an equity security that is solely owned by whoever holds the physical stock certificate.  The company that issues the bearer shares does not register the owner of the stock nor does it track transfers of ownership.  The company issues dividends to bearer shareholders when a physical coupon is presented.   Black Market Peso Exchange (BMPE):  One of the most pernicious money laundering schemes in the Western Hemisphere.  It is also one of the largest, processing billions of dollars’ worth of drug proceeds a year from Colombia alone via trade-based money laundering (TBML, defined below), “smurfing,” cash smuggling, and other schemes.  BMPE-like methodologies are also found outside the Western Hemisphere.  There are variations on the schemes involved, but generally drug traffickers repatriate and exchange illicit profits obtained in the United States without moving funds across borders.  In a simple BMPE scheme, a money launderer collaborates with a merchant operating in Colombia or Venezuela to provide him, at a discounted rate, U.S. dollars in the United States.  These funds, usually drug proceeds, are used to purchase merchandise in the United States for export to the merchant.  In return, the merchant who imports the goods provides the money launderer with local-denominated funds (pesos) in Colombia or Venezuela.  The broker takes a cut and passes along the remainder to the responsible drug cartel.    Bulk Cash Smuggling:  Bulk cash refers to the large amounts of currency notes criminals accumulate as a result of various types of criminal activity.  Smuggling, in the context of bulk cash, refers to criminals’ subsequent attempts to physically transport the money from one country to another.    Cross-border currency reporting:  Per FATF recommendation, countries should establish a currency declaration system that applies to all incoming and outgoing physical transportation of cash and other negotiable monetary instruments.  Counter-valuation:  Often employed in settling debts between hawaladars or traders.  One of the parties over-or-undervalues a commodity or trade item such as gold, thereby transferring value to another party and/or offsetting debt owed. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  9   Currency Transaction Report (CTR):  Financial institutions in some jurisdictions are required to file a CTR whenever they process a currency transaction exceeding a certain amount.  In the United States, for example, the reporting threshold is $10,000.  The amount varies per jurisdiction.  These reports include important identifying information about accountholders and the transactions.  The reports are generally transmitted to the country’s FIU.   Customer Due Diligence/Know Your Customer (CDD/KYC):  The first step financial institutions must take to detect, deter, and prevent money laundering and terrorism financing, namely, maintaining adequate knowledge and data about customers and their financial activities.  Egmont Group of FIUs:  The international standard-setter for Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs).  The organization was created with the goal of serving as a center to overcome the obstacles preventing cross-border information sharing between FIUs.  FATF-Style Regional Body (FSRB):  These bodies – which are modeled on the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and are granted certain rights by that organization – serve as regional centers for matters related to AML/CFT.  Their primary purpose is to promote a member jurisdiction’s implementation of comprehensive AML/CFT regimes and implement the FATF recommendations.  Financial Action Task Force (FATF):  FATF was created by the G7 leaders in 1989 in order to address increased alarm about money laundering’s threat to the international financial system.  This intergovernmental policy making body was given the mandate of examining money laundering techniques and trends and setting international standards for combating money laundering and terrorist financing.  Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU):  In many countries, a central national agency responsible for receiving, requesting, analyzing, and/or disseminating disclosures of financial information to the competent authorities, primarily concerning suspected proceeds of crime and potential financing of terrorism.  An FIU’s mandate is backed up by national legislation or regulation.  The Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN) is the U.S. financial intelligence unit.  Free Trade Zone (FTZ):  A special commercial and/or industrial area where foreign and domestic merchandise may be brought in without being subject to the payment of usual customs duties, taxes, and/or fees.  Merchandise, including raw materials, components, and finished goods, may be stored, sold, exhibited, repacked, assembled, sorted, or otherwise manipulated prior to re-export or entry into the area of the country covered by customs.  Duties are imposed on the merchandise (or items manufactured from the merchandise) only when the goods pass from the zone into an area of the country subject to customs.  FTZs may also be called special economic zones, free ports, duty-free zones, or bonded warehouses.  Funnel Account:  An individual or business account in one geographic area that receives multiple cash deposits, often in amounts below the cash reporting threshold, and from which the funds are withdrawn in a different geographic area with little time elapsing between the deposits and withdrawals.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  10   Hawala:  A centuries-old broker system based on trust, found throughout South Asia, the Arab world, and parts of Africa, Europe, and the Americas.  It allows customers and brokers (called hawaladars) to transfer money or value without physically moving it, often in areas of the world where banks and other formal institutions have little or no presence.  It is used by many different cultures, but under different names; “hawala” is used often as a catchall term for such systems in discussions of terrorism financing and related issues.  Hawaladar:  A broker in a hawala or hawala-type network.  Hundi:  See Hawala  International Business Company (IBC):  Firms registered in an offshore jurisdiction by a non-resident that are precluded from doing business with residents in the jurisdiction.  Offshore entities may facilitate hiding behind proxies and complicated business structures.   IBCs are frequently used in the “layering” stage of money laundering.  Integration:  The last stage of the money laundering process.  The laundered money is introduced into the economy through methods that make it appear to be normal business activity, to include real estate purchases, investing in the stock market, and buying automobiles, gold, and other high-value items.  Kimberly Process (KP):  The Kimberly Process was initiated by the UN to keep “conflict” or “blood” diamonds out of international commerce, thereby drying up the funds that sometimes fuel armed conflicts in Africa’s diamond producing regions.  Layering:  This is the second stage of the money laundering process.  The purpose of this stage is to make it more difficult for law enforcement to detect or follow the trail of illegal proceeds.  Methods include converting cash into monetary instruments, wire transferring money between bank accounts, etc.  Legal Person:  A company or other entity that has legal rights and is subject to obligations.  In the FATF Recommendations, a legal person refers to a partnership, corporation, association, or other established entity that can conduct business or own property, as opposed to a human being.  Mutual Evaluation (ME):  All FATF and FSRB members have committed to undergoing periodic multilateral monitoring and peer review to assess their compliance with FATF’s recommendations.  Mutual evaluations are one of the FATF’s/FSRB’s primary instruments for determining the effectiveness of a country’s AML/CFT regime.  Mutual Evaluation Report (MER):  At the end of the FATF/FSRB mutual evaluation process, the assessment team issues a report that describes the country’s AML/CFT regime and rates its effectiveness and compliance with the FATF Recommendations.  Mobile Payments or M-Payments:  An umbrella term that generally refers to the growing use of cell phones to credit, send, receive, and transfer money and virtual value. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  11  Natural Person:  In jurisprudence, a natural person is a real human being, as opposed to a legal person (see above).  In many cases, fundamental human rights are implicitly granted only to natural persons.  Offshore Financial Center:  Usually a low-tax jurisdiction that provides financial and investment services to non-resident companies and individuals.  Generally, companies doing business in offshore centers are prohibited from having clients or customers who are resident in the jurisdiction.  Such centers may have strong secrecy provisions or minimal identification requirements.  Over-invoicing:  When money launderers and those involved with value transfer, trade-fraud, and illicit finance misrepresent goods or services on an invoice by indicating they cost more than they are actually worth.  This allows one party in the transaction to transfer money to the other under the guise of legitimate trade.  Politically Exposed Person (PEP):  A term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function, or an individual who is closely related to such a person.  This includes the heads of international organizations.  Placement:  This is the first stage of the money laundering process.  Illicit money is disguised or misrepresented, then placed into circulation through financial institutions, casinos, shops, and other businesses, both local and abroad.  A variety of methods can be used for this purpose, including currency smuggling, bank transactions, currency exchanges, securities purchases, structuring transactions, and blending illicit with licit funds.   Shell Company:  An incorporated company with no significant operations, established for the sole purpose of holding or transferring funds, often for money laundering purposes.  As the name implies, shell companies have only a name, address, and bank accounts; clever money launderers often attempt to make them look more like real businesses by maintaining fake financial records and other elements.  Shell companies are often incorporated as IBCs.    Smurfing/Structuring:  A money laundering technique that involves splitting a large bank deposit into smaller deposits to evade financial transparency reporting requirements.  Suspicious Transaction Report/Suspicious Activity Report (STR/SAR):  If a financial institution suspects or has reasonable grounds to suspect that the funds involved in a given transaction derive from criminal or terrorist activity, it is obligated to file a report with its national FIU containing key information about the transaction.  In the United States, SAR is the most common term for such a report, though STR is used in most other jurisdictions.   Tipping Off:  The disclosure of the reporting of suspicious or unusual activity to an individual who is the subject of such a report, or to a third party.  The FATF Recommendations call for such an action to be criminalized.  Trade-Based Money Laundering (TBML):  The process of disguising the proceeds of crime and moving value via trade transactions in an attempt to legitimize their illicit origin.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  12  Trade Transparency Unit (TTU):  TTUs examine trade between countries by comparing, for example, the export records from Country A and the corresponding import records from Country B.  Allowing for some recognized variables, the data should match.  Any wide discrepancies could be indicative of trade fraud (including TBML), corruption, or the back door to underground remittance systems and informal value transfer systems, such as hawala.  Under-invoicing:  When money launderers and those involved with value transfer, trade fraud, and illicit finance misrepresent goods or services on an invoice by indicating they cost less than they are actually worth.  This allows the traders to settle debts between each other in the form of goods or services.  Unexplained Wealth Order (UWO):  A type of court order to compel someone to reveal the sources of their unexplained wealth.  UWOs require the owner of an asset to explain how he or she was able to afford that asset.  Persons who fail to provide a response may have assets seized or may be subject to other sanctions.  UNSCR 1267:  UN Security Council Resolution 1267 and subsequent resolutions require all UN member states to take specific measures against individuals and entities associated with the Taliban and al-Qaida.  The “1267 Committee” maintains a public list of these individuals and entities, and countries are encouraged to submit potential names to the committee for designation.  UNSCR 1373:  UN Security Council Resolution 1373 requires states to freeze without delay the assets of individuals and entities associated with any global terrorist organization.  This is significant because it goes beyond the scope of Resolution 1267 and requires member states to impose sanctions against all terrorist entities.  Virtual Currency:  Virtual currency is an internet-based form of currency or medium of exchange, distinct from physical currencies or forms of value such as banknotes, coins, and gold.  It is electronically created and stored.  Some forms are encrypted.  They allow for instantaneous transactions and borderless transfer of ownership.  Virtual currencies generally can be purchased, traded, and exchanged among user groups and can be used to buy physical goods and services, but can also be limited or restricted to certain online communities, such as a given social network or internet game.  Virtual currencies are purchased directly or indirectly with genuine money at a given exchange rate and can generally be remotely redeemed for genuine monetary credit or cash.  According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, virtual currency operates like traditional currency, but does not have all the same attributes; i.e., it does not have legal tender status.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  13  Legislative Basis and Methodology for the INCSR  The 2021 volume on Money Laundering is a legislatively-mandated section of the annual International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR), in accordance with section 489 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the “FAA,” 22 U.S.C. § 2291).1   The FAA requires the Department of State to produce a report on the extent to which each country or entity that received assistance under chapter 8 of Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act in the past two fiscal years has “met the goals and objectives of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances” (“1988 UN Drug Convention”) (FAA § 489(a)(1)(A)).  In addition to identifying countries in relation to illicit narcotics, the INCSR is mandated to identify “major money laundering countries” (FAA §489(a)(3)(C)).  The INCSR also is required to report findings on each country’s adoption of laws and regulations to prevent narcotics-related money laundering (FAA §489(a)(7)(C)).  This volume is the section of the INCSR that reports on money laundering and country efforts to address it.  The statute defines a “major money laundering country” as one “whose financial institutions engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from international narcotics trafficking” (FAA § 481(e)(7)).  The determination is derived from the list of countries included in INCSR Volume I (which focuses on narcotics) and other countries proposed by U.S. government experts based on indicia of significant drug-related money laundering activities.  Given money laundering activity trends, the activities of non-financial businesses and professions or other value transfer systems are given due consideration.    Inclusion in Volume II is not an indication that a jurisdiction is not making strong efforts to combat money laundering or that it has not fully met relevant international standards.  The INCSR is not a “black list” of jurisdictions, nor are there sanctions associated with it.  The U.S. Department of State regularly reaches out to counterparts to request updates on money laundering and AML efforts, and it welcomes information.  The following countries/jurisdictions have been identified this year:  Major Money Laundering Jurisdictions in 2020:  Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Burma, Cabo Verde, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curacao, Cyprus, Dominica,  1 This 2021 report on Money Laundering is based upon the contributions of numerous U.S. government agencies and international sources.  Specifically, the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, U.S. Treasury Department’s Office of Terrorist Financing and Financial Crimes, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, Internal Revenue Service, Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, and Office of Technical Assistance; Department of Homeland Security’s Immigrations and Customs Enforcement and Customs and Border Protection; Department of Justice’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section, Office of International Affairs, Drug Enforcement Administration, Federal Bureau of Investigation, and Office for Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance, and Training.  Also providing information on training and technical assistance is the independent Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  14  Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyz Republic, Laos, Liberia, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Russia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Senegal, Sint Maarten, Spain, Suriname, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Turkmenistan, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  15  Overview  The COVID-19 pandemic disrupted governments and commercial activity around the globe in 2020.  Onsite supervisory and audit programs were delayed or cancelled.  Financial institutions and businesses adjusted their functions and adopted new methods of communicating and conducting transactions.  Yet, despite the contraction of the global economy, the flow of illicit money continued.  Criminals not only continued to perpetrate traditional financial crimes but devised new ways to exploit the pandemic through counterfeiting essential goods and telephone and email scams promoting health or medical products.    The 2021 edition of the Congressionally mandated “International Narcotics Control Strategy Report, Volume II:  Money Laundering” focuses on the exposure to this threat in the specific context of narcotics-related money laundering.  The report reviews the anti-money laundering (AML) legal and institutional infrastructure of jurisdictions and highlights the most significant steps each has taken to improve its AML regime.  It also describes key vulnerabilities and deficiencies of these regimes, identifies each jurisdiction’s capacity to cooperate in international investigations, and highlights the United States’ provision of AML-related technical assistance.    The United States is a founding member of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and has worked within the organization and with partner countries and FATF-style regional bodies to promote compliance with the FATF 49 Recommendations.  It has also supported, through technical assistance and other means, the development and implementation of robust national-level AML regimes around the world.  Corruption continues to flourish in many parts of the world, facilitating organized criminal enterprises and money laundering.  Although the potential for corruption exists in all countries, weak political will, ineffective institutions, or deficient AML infrastructure heighten the risk that it will occur.  The 2021 report highlights actions several governments are taking to more effectively address corruption and its links to money laundering.  While legislative and institutional reforms are an important foundation for preventing corruption, robust and consistent enforcement is also key.  In 2020, the Kyrgyz Republic passed an anticorruption strategy for 2021-2024, which includes plans to better repatriate stolen assets.  The Government of Mozambique adopted a new asset recovery bill as well as unique account numbers for individuals to use in banks nationwide.  Afghanistan issued regulations implementing asset forfeiture for corruption cases in the country’s first such asset-recovery regulation and, in October 2020, Afghan officials announced they prevented the illegal transfer of $1.6 million over the preceding four months.     Increasing the transparency of beneficial ownership remains a central focus of AML efforts, appearing in coverage of some recent high-level corruption allegations in the media.  Shell companies, many located in offshore centers with secrecy stipulations, are used by drug traffickers, organized criminal organizations, corrupt officials, and some regimes to launder money and evade sanctions.  “Off-the shelf” international business companies (IBCs), which  can be purchased via the internet, remain a significant concern by effectively providing    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  16  anonymity to true beneficial owners.  While this report reflects that beneficial ownership transparency remains a vulnerability in many jurisdictions, it also highlights important steps taken by many governments.    In a major anticorruption and AML milestone for the United States, the U.S. Congress passed the Corporate Transparency Act in 2020.  Once completed, regulations to implement the act will require corporations and limited liability companies to disclose their beneficial owners to the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), which will make the information available to appropriate government entities and financial institutions.  The United States was not the only jurisdiction to take action in 2020.  In The Bahamas, the country’s Attorney General’s Office and Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) implemented a secure search system for accessing online information on beneficial ownership of legal entities registered in the country.  Belize enacted legislation to give effect to tax transparency obligations.  Since October 2020, the names of subscribers, registered offices, year-end share capital, and nature of business of companies in the Cayman Islands are publicly available.  A new law in the Netherlands requires all corporate and other legal entities to list their ultimate beneficial owners in a transparent register.  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) Council of Ministers (Cabinet) issued a resolution requiring declaration of beneficial ownership, shareholder disclosure, and timely updating of ownership information.      As new technologies emerge, crimes like money laundering evolve, posing new challenges for societies, governments, and law enforcement.  The rapid growth of global mobile payments (m-payments) and virtual currencies demands particular attention in the AML sphere.  The use of mobile telephony to send and receive money or credit continues to exceed the rate of bank account ownership in many parts of the world.  The risk that criminal and terrorist organizations will co-opt m-payment services is real, particularly as the services can manifest less than optimal financial transparency.    Virtual currencies are growing in popularity and expanding their reach.  In 2020, The Bahamas launched the Sand Dollar, the world’s first central bank-backed digital currency.  The Sand Dollar is stored in a non-interest-bearing digital wallet accessible through mobile devices.  China is currently piloting a central bank-backed digital currency known as the eCNY or eCNY Digital Currency Electronic Payment.  In March 2020, the Supreme Court of India removed an earlier government ban on trading in virtual currencies.    A growing number of jurisdictions are responding to the challenges posed by the rapid development of such anonymous e-payment methodologies.  In 2020, the Prosecution Service of Georgia created a new cybercrime department and is in the process of developing virtual currency seizure guidelines for law enforcement.  The Cayman Islands passed new legislation identifying its Monetary Authority as the AML supervisor of virtual asset service providers.  The Peruvian Financial Intelligence Unit began supervising virtual currency exchanges and launched a risk analysis of virtual currencies, which will inform the drafting of a specific regulation.  Antigua and Barbuda adopted legislation to introduce warrants for law enforcement to search the contents of electronic devices.  The United Kingdom updated its AML regulations to cover virtual assets.  In Thailand, the government held public hearings on proposed legislative amendments designed to cover financial technology service providers.  Canada passed regulatory \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  17  amendments that now require money service businesses (MSBs) dealing in virtual currencies to comply with AML requirements and register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC).  Foreign MSBs also must fulfill new AML compliance measures and register with FINTRAC.   Although new technologies are gaining popularity, money launderers continue to use free trade zones and gaming enterprises to launder illicit funds.  Trade-based money laundering (TBML), in particular, is a long-standing area of concern.  Trade-based systems act as a kind of parallel method of transferring money and value around the world.  Because systems such as hawala, the black market peso exchange, and the use of commodities such as gold and diamonds are not captured by many financial reporting requirements, they pose tremendous challenges for law enforcement.  These methods are often based simply on the alteration of shipping documents or invoices, and thus are frequently undetected unless jurisdictions work together to share information and compare documentation.  The UAE now mandates hawaladars and informal money transfer service providers formally register with its central bank.  The growing network of Trade Transparency Units (TTUs), now numbering 16 active units, has revealed the extent of transnational TBML through the monitoring of import and export documentation.  These units focus on detecting anomalies in trade data—such as deliberate over- and under-invoicing—that can be a powerful predictor of TBML.  In recognition of this ongoing threat, a joint FATF-Egmont Group project is developing new guidelines for the identification of possible TBML.  As political stability, democracy, and free markets depend on solvent, stable, and honest financial, commercial, and trade systems, the continued development of effective AML regimes consistent with international standards is vital.  The United States looks forward to continuing to work with international partners in furthering this important agenda, promoting compliance with international norms and strengthening capacities globally to prevent and combat money laundering.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  18  Training Activities  During 2020, the United States continued its endeavors to strengthen the capacity of our partners in the fight against money laundering despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Although some activities were curtailed or completed remotely, U.S. regulatory agencies and law enforcement continued to share best practices and provide training and technical assistance on money laundering countermeasures, financial investigations, and related issues to their counterparts around the globe.  The programs built the capacity of our partners and provided the necessary tools to recognize, prevent, investigate, and prosecute money laundering, financial crimes, terrorist financing, and related criminal activity.  U.S. agencies provided instruction directly or through other agencies or implementing partners, unilaterally or in collaboration with foreign counterparts, and with either a bilateral recipient or in multijurisdictional training exercises.  The following is a representative, but not necessarily exhaustive, overview of the capacity building provided and organized by sponsoring agencies.   Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System (FRB)  The FRB conducts a Bank Secrecy Act (BSA) and OFAC compliance program review as part of its regular safety and soundness examination.  These examinations are an important component in the United States’ efforts to detect and deter money laundering and terrorist financing.  The FRB monitors its supervised financial institutions’ conduct for BSA and OFAC compliance.  Internationally, during 2020, the FRB did not conduct any in person AML/CFT international trainings or technical assistance missions due to the COVID-19 pandemic.  It did conduct remote training programs for over 300 participants.         \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  19  Department of Homeland Security    Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  Both the International Operations Directorate and International Support Directorate of CBP provide international training programs and/or technical assistance.  CBP did not conduct any AML training or technical assistance programs in calendar year 2020.     Immigration and Customs Enforcement Homeland Security Investigations (ICE HSI)  During 2020, ICE HSI provided critical training and technical assistance to the United States’ foreign law enforcement partners.  In Canada, ICE HSI worked with Canadian law enforcement agencies to provide training on cryptocurrency, the dark web, asset forfeiture, and financial investigative techniques.  ICE HSI deployed personnel to the Canada Border Services Agency’s Trade Fraud and Trade Based Money Laundering Center as well as with Public Safety Canada and the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Financial Crimes Coordination Center to increase information sharing in financial investigations and combatting money laundering.  ICE HSI partnered with Caribbean law enforcement agencies to provide training on U.S.-based firearm export violations and its ties to narcotic smuggling within the United States.  In Asia and Europe, ICE HSI trained bank officials and law enforcement partners in Malaysia and France on the ties between cryptocurrency money laundering and those engaged in crimes against children, child exploitation, and overall TBML.  In South America, ICE HSI assisted the Peruvian National Police in investigating TBML occurring within Peru and trained Colombian military, tax and customs, and financial investigative offices on money laundering and contraband targeting to identify and disrupt illicit financial activity taking place along the country's remote coasts.  Finally, in Central America, ICE HSI provided training on cryptocurrency investigations to Panamanian partners within the Panama National Police, its Public Ministry, and other Panamanian law enforcement bodies.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  20  Department of Justice   Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)  The Office of Domestic Operations, Financial Investigations Section (ODF) coordinates DEA’s efforts to target the financial aspects of transnational criminal organizations across domestic and foreign offices.  ODF works in conjunction with DEA field offices, foreign counterparts, and the interagency community to provide guidance and support on financial investigations and offers a variety of investigative tools and oversight on DEA’s undercover financial investigations.  ODF also liaises with the international law enforcement community to further cooperation between countries and investigative efforts, to include prosecution of money launderers, the seizure of assets, and denial of revenue.   ODF regularly briefs and educates United States government officials and diplomats, foreign government officials, and military and law enforcement counterparts regarding the latest trends in money laundering, narcoterrorism financing, international banking, offshore corporations, international wire transfer of funds, and financial investigative tools and techniques.   ODF also conducts training for DEA field offices, both domestic and foreign, as well as for foreign counterparts, in order to share strategic ideas and promote effective techniques in financial investigations.  During 2020, ODF participated in and led a number of virtual workshops and strategy sessions focused on COVID-19 money laundering trends, TBML, private sector engagement, virtual currency, and investigative case coordination.  Also during 2020, DEA participated in virtual money laundering training courses and workshops with a number of international partners, to include but not limited to:  Colombia, Panama, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Mexico, and Canada.     Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI)  The FBI provides training and/or technical assistance to national law enforcement personnel globally.  Training and technical assistance programs enhance host country law enforcement’s capacity to investigate and prosecute narcotics-related money laundering crimes.  The FBI has provided workshops introducing high-level money laundering techniques used by criminal and terrorist organizations.  The training may focus on topics such as a foundational understanding of drug trafficking investigative and analytical techniques and tactics, money laundering and public corruption, or terrorism financing crimes and their relationship to drug trafficking as a support for terrorism activities.  In 2020, the FBI provided financial crime and money laundering training to Argentina, Antigua and Barbuda, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Hungary, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Paraguay, and Trinidad and Tobago.  The FBI also participated in training provided through UNODC.     \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  21  Office of Overseas Prosecutorial Development, Assistance and Training (OPDAT)  In 2020, with funding from INL, OPDAT provided expert AML assistance throughout the world consistent with international standards and in furtherance of U.S. national security:    Africa  In The Gambia, OPDAT assisted in pursuing foreign assets of the corrupt former president, including assistance to the USDOJ’s Money Laundering and Asset Recovery Section to initiate civil forfeiture proceedings on a multimillion-dollar property in Maryland.  Additionally, in late 2020, FBI Special Agents returned to Ghana to continue case-based mentoring with investigators. Asia and the Pacific In the Maldives, OPDAT-mentored prosecutors secured a 20-year sentence of the former vice president for money laundering and corruption.  In Indonesia, OPDAT worked with the anticorruption commission and provided training to over 1,200 journalists, academics, civil servants, and others on how money is laundered through corporations and the role the media can and should play.  In Nepal, OPDAT has continually advocated for the creation of specialized units, including AML prosecutors.  In Bangladesh, OPDAT held an anticorruption/AML virtual program for approximately 50 prosecutors and law enforcement officers.  In Burma, OPDAT drafted an AML concept note and continued promoting a set of written police prosecutor guidelines for AML cases, which reflect international standards.   Europe Through regional and bilateral workshops, as well as extensive case-based mentoring, in 2020 OPDAT developed the financial investigation skills of police and prosecutors throughout the Western Balkans, including Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo, North Macedonia, Montenegro, and Serbia, as well as in Bulgaria, Latvia, and Romania; this capacity building has resulted in significant AML successes.  OPDAT provided AML instruction throughout the region to judges on reviewing complex financial evidence and to journalists and civil society representatives on conducting open source financial investigations.  OPDAT also assisted the government of Malta to enact AML reforms necessary to comply with international standards.     Western Hemisphere  In Mexico, OPDAT provided case-based mentoring to prosecutors handling AML cases, as well as support to the Mexican Congress.  These engagements have resulted in significant arrests and prosecutions of cartel members and leaders.  OPDAT also provided regular AML and asset forfeiture assistance and mentoring to Guatemalan, Honduran, and Salvadoran prosecutors, investigators, judges, and AML units, and led regional efforts to share best practices and promote increased regional sharing of information on these topics.  Finally, OPDAT hosted a Pan American AML/CFT Seminar Series with the goal of strengthening cross-border cooperation throughout the Americas against money laundering and terrorist financing.  More than 250 prosecutors, judges, and analysts participated.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  22  Department of State  The Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement (INL) works to keep Americans safe by countering crime, illegal drugs, and instability abroad.  Through its international technical assistance and training programs, in coordination with other Department bureaus, U.S. government agencies, and multilateral organizations, INL addresses a broad range of law enforcement and criminal justice areas, including developing strong AML regimes around the world.      INL and its partners design programs and provide AML training and technical assistance to countries that demonstrate the political will to develop viable AML regimes.  The strategic objective is to disrupt the activities of transnational criminal organizations and drug trafficking organizations by disrupting their financial resources.  INL funds many of the regional training and technical assistance programs offered by U.S. law enforcement agencies, including those provided at the INL-managed International Law Enforcement Academies.  Examples of INL sponsored programs include:    Europe and Asia  Afghanistan:  Through agreements with the Department of Justice and UNODC, INL supported mentoring and technical assistance on AML/CFT to Afghan investigators and prosecutors engaged in processing corruption, major crimes, narcotics, and national security cases.   Central Asia Region:  The United States supports a regional AML/CFT advisor to provide training and mentoring to FIU and prosecutorial personnel in Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan in order to improve the effectiveness of national AML/CFT frameworks.  Europe:  INL is working closely with partners in Europe to detect and stop the flow of illicit funds derived from criminal enterprises, often involving corruption and organized crime.  INL is working closely with authorities in Latvia, Slovak Republic, Cyprus, Malta, Bulgaria, and Romania, among others, to enhance their efforts to investigate financial crimes, including money laundering and other crimes related to corruption and organized crime.   Laos: The United States supported training for the Lao Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Office, Customs, police, prosecutors, and judges on financial investigations, AML, bulk-cash smuggling, and risk identification and assessment.  Mongolia: The United States supported training on financial crimes and AML for Mongolian law enforcement, prosecutors, and FIU staff, as well as the provision of specialized software to facilitate data collection, management, analysis, and workflow.  Philippines:  The USG has supported training for AMLC on areas including the collection of electronic evidence, casino financial crimes, counter terrorism financing, case preparation, asset management, database support, and investigations. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  23  Western Hemisphere  Caribbean:  The United States partnered with the Caribbean Community Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (CARICOM IMPACS) to host a three-day virtual Caribbean Financial Crimes Technical Working Group covering civil asset forfeiture, financial crimes legislation, money laundering, electronic evidence, and regional financial crimes and case studies.  Participating countries included The Bahamas, Barbados, Belize, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, Haiti, St. Lucia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Suriname, and Trinidad and Tobago.   The United States supported UNODC trainings on TBML for 1,247 Caribbean officials and an AML training led by Trinidad and Tobago for an additional 573 Caribbean officials.  Central America:  In El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras, INL supports the deployment of Department of Justice resident legal advisors who focus on financial crimes.  INL also works with specialized units in the offices of the attorneys general in each of these countries to provide mentoring, advice, and the skills needed to investigate and prosecute crimes with a money laundering nexus.  INL interagency agreements with the Department of Justice support law enforcement and prosecutorial coordination through quarterly meetings and technical assistance.  In November 2020, these coordination efforts brought together gang prosecutors and investigators from El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, and the United States in a one-week coordinated law enforcement action that resulted in criminal charges in Central America against more than 700 members of transnational criminal organizations.  To ensure continuity in justice sector training during the COVID-19 pandemic, INL supported increased online training opportunities for justice sector actors.    Similarly, INL support to U.S. ICE-vetted transnational criminal investigative units in El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Panama helps disrupt and dismantle transnational criminal organizations and investigate crimes, including money laundering.        Colombia:  INL provides training, equipment, and case-based mentoring to prosecutors and investigators in the Attorney General’s Office.  These lines of effort are designed to prioritize complex, transnational organized crime cases with the goal of prosecuting money laundering and disrupting financing for drug trafficking and other organized crime activities.  Further, INL supports the Special Assets Entity in developing procedures to recover assets forfeited using non-conviction-based forfeiture procedures.  Additionally, INL supports training and technical assistance for Colombian judicial actors to make informed decisions in complex AML cases.  Ecuador:  Ecuadorian cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies improved due to increased United States technical assistance for Ecuador’s FIU, the Financial and Economic Analysis Unit (UAFE) and the formation of a vetted AML unit comprised of the Attorney General’s Office, UAFE, and National Police personnel.     Peru:  The United States supported AML trainings on virtual currencies and financial technology. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  24   Suriname:  The FIU is developing further technical skills through INL-supported training programs.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  25  Department of the Treasury    Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN)   FinCEN is the United States FIU, administrator of the Bank Secrecy Act, and primary regulator of AML/CFT activity.  FinCEN conducts bilateral and multilateral training and assistance with foreign counterpart FIUs and various domestic and international agencies and departments.  This work includes but is not limited to:  multilateral information sharing projects focused on specific topics of interest among jurisdictions; analyst exchange programs and training; and programs that enhance analytic capabilities and strengthen operational collaboration to identify, track, and develop actionable operational intelligence.  In 2020, FinCEN did a presentation to the FATF Virtual Asset Contact Group (which included participation across all FATF regions); participated in the UNODC Southeast Asia Cryptocurrency Working Group meeting and training, which was focused especially on Southeast Asia; the United States-United Kingdom Virtual Currency Roundtable; and a training program for the Kuwait FIU on the role of an FIU in SAR analysis and assistance to law enforcement.   Internal Revenue Service, Criminal Investigations (IRS-CI)  IRS-CI provides training and technical assistance to international law enforcement officers in detecting and investigating financial crimes involving tax, money laundering, terrorist financing, and public corruption.  With funding provided by the DOS, DOJ, and other sources, IRS-CI delivers training through agency and multi-agency technical assistance programs.   IRS-CI delivered the Inter-Agency Cooperation in Financial Investigations course at the ILEA Regional Training Center in Accra, Ghana in March 2020.  The training was co-delivered with DEA instructors.    The IRS-CI international training program created a virtual training alternative to meet the needs of our training partners abroad.  In 2020, IRS-CI offered webinars focused on a variety of financial techniques and case studies involving financial crimes.  These webinars benefited criminal investigators and their supervisors, tax enforcement officials, and government prosecutors in combating serious crimes.  Current webinar offerings include the following topics:  International Public Corruption with Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and Money Laundering Violations Case Study; TBML via Value Added Tax Fraud Case Study; PEP Case Study; Narcotics and the Dark Web Case Study; and Democratic People’s Republic of Korea Cyber Hack and Cryptocurrency Case Study.    The IRS-CI international training program delivered webinars for government officials in Belize, Canada, Cayman Islands, Colombia, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, Mexico, Panama, and Paraguay.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  26  Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (OCC)   The U.S. Department of Treasury’s OCC charters, regulates, and supervises all national banks and federal savings associations in the U.S.  The OCC’s goal is to ensure these institutions operate in a safe and sound manner and comply with all laws and regulations, including the Bank Secrecy Act, as well as consumer protection laws and implementing regulations.  The OCC also sponsors several initiatives to provide AML/CFT training to foreign banking supervisors.  However, in 2020, due to COVID-19, the OCC was not able offer its annual AML/CFT School, designed specifically for foreign banking supervisors, to increase their knowledge of money laundering and terrorism financing typologies and improve their ability to examine and enforce compliance with national laws.  OCC officials met with representatives from foreign law enforcement authorities, FIUs, and AML/CFT supervisory agencies to discuss the U.S. AML/CFT regime, the agencies’ risk-based approach to AML/CFT supervision, examination techniques and procedures, and enforcement actions.  The OCC is preparing to offer virtual AML/CFT training to foreign regulators in 2021.    Office of Technical Assistance (OTA)   Each of OTA’s five teams – Revenue Policy and Administration, Budget and Financial Accountability, Government Debt and Infrastructure Finance, Banking & Financial Services, and Economic Crimes – focuses on particular areas to establish strong financial sectors and sound public financial management in developing and transition countries.  OTA follows a number of guiding principles to complement its holistic approach to technical assistance and supports self-reliance by equipping countries with the knowledge and skills required to reduce dependence on international aid and achieve sustainability.  OTA is selective and only works with governments that are committed to reform – reform that counterparts design and own – and to applying U.S. assistance effectively.  OTA works side-by-side with counterparts through mentoring and on-the-job training, which is accomplished through co-location at a relevant government agency.  OTA’s activities are funded by a direct appropriation from the U.S. Congress as well as transfers from other U.S. agencies, notably the U.S. Department of State and USAID.  The mission of the OTA Economic Crimes Team (ECT), in particular, is to provide technical assistance to help foreign governments develop and implement internationally compliant AML/CFT regimes.  In this context, the ECT also addresses underlying predicate crimes, including corruption and organized crime.  To ensure successful outcomes, ECT engagements are based on express requests from foreign government counterparts.  The ECT responds to a request with an onsite assessment by ECT management, which considers the jurisdiction’s noncompliance with international standards and the corresponding needs for technical assistance, as well as the willingness by the counterparts to engage in an active partnership with the ECT to address those deficiencies.  An ECT engagement, tailored to the specific conditions of the jurisdiction, may involve placement of a resident advisor and/or utilization of intermittent advisors under the coordination of a team lead.  The scope of ECT technical assistance is broad and can include awareness-raising aimed at a range of AML/CFT stakeholders; improvements to an AML/CFT legal \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  27  framework, including legislation, regulations, and formal guidance; and improvement of the technical competence of stakeholders.  The range of on-the-job training provided by the ECT is equally broad and includes, among other topics, supervisory techniques for relevant regulatory areas; analytic and financial investigative techniques; cross-border currency movement and TBML; asset seizure, forfeiture, and management; and the use of interagency financial crimes working groups.   In 2020, following these principles and methods, the ECT delivered technical assistance to Angola, Argentina, Belize, Botswana, Cabo Verde, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Estonia, Iraq, Latvia, the Maldives, Mongolia, Sierra Leone, Sri Lanka, and Zambia.       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  28  Comparative Table Key  The comparative table following the Glossary of Terms below identifies the broad range of actions, effective as of December 31, 2020, that jurisdictions have, or have not, taken to combat drug money laundering.

Afghanistan remains the world’s largest opium producer, and corruption continues to be a significant obstacle to the nation’s progress.  Despite laws and regulations to combat administrative and financial crimes, Afghanistan still struggles to transparently implement and enforce an effective AML/CFT regime.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The illicit narcotics trade, corruption, illegal mineral extraction, smuggling, and TBML are major sources of illicit revenue.  Afghanistan’s borders with Pakistan and Iran are porous, facilitating smuggling.  Fewer than 15 percent of Afghans have accounts with financial institutions.  Hawala networks provide financial and non-financial business services in local, regional, and international markets and are often used to circumvent government oversight.  Afghanistan’s central bank, Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB), is advocating to require hawalas to change their legal structures from sole proprietorships to corporations with governance boards, compliance policies and procedures, and customer screening.  Hawala union leaders have previously held strikes and lobbied political forces to stop what they perceive as over-regulation.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Afghanistan has a comprehensive AML law that includes KYC and STR provisions.  A cross-border currency reporting requirement is also in place.  In May 2020, Afghanistan issued its first regulations implementing asset confiscation, although only for corruption cases.    Although Afghanistan’s domestic law allows for extradition based upon multilateral arrangements, its constitution prohibits extradition of Afghan citizens without a reciprocal agreement between Afghanistan and the requesting country.  The United States does not have an extradition treaty with Afghanistan.  There is no bilateral Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty (MLAT) between the United States and Afghanistan, but both countries are parties to multilateral conventions that provide a legal basis for assistance.   Afghanistan is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/a-c/afghanistan/documents/mutualevaluationofafghanistan.html.      AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The poor security environment, endemic corruption, and a lack of investigative capacity all impact the supervision and regulation of financial institutions, MSBs, and money exchangers.  Recent staff turnover at the DAB and the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Center of \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  36  Afghanistan (FinTRACA), Afghanistan’s FIU, have eroded institutional knowledge and diminished confidence of international partners.    Many hawalas use the formal banking sector for day-to-day operations and to settle balances with other hawalas, both domestically and abroad.  However, because hawaladars have a history of and preference for opacity, a lack of technical capacity, and an unwillingness to implement CDD requirements (which they view as overly burdensome), they generally fail to file STRs.  FinTRACA is working to expand supervision and implementation of the MSB/hawala licensing program.    The new asset recovery regulations cover only corruption cases.  The Afghan government should expand the regulations to include other crimes, such as money laundering and narcotics trafficking.   Lack of supervision and regulation of precious metals and stones dealers, lawyers, accountants, and real estate agents remains a significant challenge.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Regulators and enforcement officers need adequate security and resources, political support, and continued training.    Afghanistan’s Attorney General’s Office (AGO) and law enforcement authorities are hampered by limited resources, lack of technical expertise, poor coordination with counterpart agencies, lack of full independence, and poor infrastructure.  Attorneys, judges, and law enforcement authorities frequently lack the capacity to pursue and prosecute sophisticated or complex cases.  Law enforcement officers, prosecutors, and judges continue to need training on effective, lawful asset seizure.  Afghanistan should continue to improve seizure and confiscation procedures.    Cooperation between FinTRACA and the AGO is often limited by capacity hurdles and corruption issues.  Weak prosecutorial capacity to pursue money laundering cases and asset seizures is problematic.  No entity has responsibility for post-conviction asset recovery or for the use or equitable sharing of forfeited assets for crimes, other than assets forfeited in corruption cases.   Insurance companies and securities dealers are required to file STRs, but the government does not fully enforce this requirement.   FinTRACA should establish a publicly available list of licensed hawalas and promote their use by the public.  The DAB should continue to enhance its AML/CFT supervision and enforcement capabilities.  Afghanistan should fully enforce market manipulation and counterfeiting as predicates for money laundering and strengthen AML supervision of DNFBPs.  In April 2020, DAB issued a report detailing the results of its onsite AML/CFT examinations of 57 MSBs and foreign-exchange dealers (FXD).  The report identifies a multitude of significant deficiencies and concludes that, overall, MSB and FXD compliance with applicable laws and \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  37  regulations is weak.  The report recommends industry-wide training, KYC documents maintenance, and improving the quality and frequency of mandated reports.   In mid-2020, the former director of FinTRACA was removed from that position over allegations of bribery in his former role as director of banking supervision at DAB.  As of year-end 2020, both the FinTRACA director and its director for non-banking supervision, the division that supervises hawalas, serve in acting capacities.    Kabul’s international airport continues to demonstrate ineffective currency controls, although efforts to reform Afghanistan’s customs service and its operations have shown promise in reducing currency smuggling by air passengers and cargo.  In October 2020, officials announced they prevented the illegal transfer of $1.6 million over the preceding four months.  Afghanistan should strengthen inspection controls and enforcement of the currency declaration regime at airports and borders.    Albania  OVERVIEW   The Government of Albania made no significant progress toward thwarting money laundering and financial crimes in 2020.  Albania remains vulnerable to money laundering due to corruption, organized crime networks, and weak legal and government institutions.  The country has a large cash economy and informal sector, with significant money inflows from abroad in the form of remittances and diverse investments.  Major proceeds-generating crimes in Albania include drug trafficking, tax evasion, and smuggling.  Albanian criminal organizations have links to networks operating in Europe and South America.  Albania registered some progress with the use of its anti-Mafia confiscation law, including the forfeiture of 40 percent of assets belonging to notorious drug kingpin Klement Balili, dubbed the “Escobar of the Balkans.”    Ongoing judicial reforms, including the vetting of judges and prosecutors to eradicate corruption from the justice sector and the creation of multiple specialized police units targeting financial and economic crimes, have improved Albania’s prospects for addressing money laundering.  These efforts, however, are still hampered by capacity challenges in recently established justice institutions and pervasive corruption that undermines the rule of law.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Narcotics trafficking and other organized crime activity are the major sources of money laundering.  Albania’s proximity to Western Europe and the presence of Albanian organized crime in Western Europe and South America increase vulnerabilities.  Real estate investments and business development projects are among the most prevalent methods of laundering illicit proceeds.  Legal loopholes in 2019 AML legislation still allow casinos at five-star resorts and tourist locations.     \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  38  KEY LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Albania has comprehensive CDD and STR requirements in place.    In January 2020, parliament approved anti-illicit enrichment legislation that gives the Specialized Anticorruption Body (SPAK) and the Albanian State Police (ASP) the ability to target illicit assets through seizure and confiscation and limits the economic activity and free movement of criminals.  While effective in initial asset seizure, meeting evidentiary requirements for final asset seizure remains challenging.    Recent legal and policy changes have improved Albania's ability to combat money laundering and financial crimes, though implementation has been inconsistent.  The Anti-Mafia Law was amended in 2020 to improve management of confiscated assets.  Albanian law requires annual asset disclosure by public officials, including a requirement that officials declare preferential treatment and beneficial ownership of assets.  Provisions also prohibit officials from keeping substantial cash outside of the banking system.  Albania and the United States do not have a bilateral MLAT, but cooperation is possible through multilateral conventions.  Albania is a member of MONEYVAL, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent evaluation is available at:  https://www.coe.int/en/web/moneyval/jurisdictions/albania.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The Albanian FIU is undergoing leadership changes and is seeking international technical assistance to contribute to a stronger AML regime.  Constitutional and legal reforms in recent years include reforms of the justice system and vetting of judges and prosecutors for unexplained wealth.  Forty-six percent of judges and prosecutors vetted to date have failed as a result of unexplained wealth or having personal ties with questionable entities, and a further 17 percent have resigned to avoid scrutiny.  Albania has a substantial black market for smuggled goods that weak border controls and customs enforcement facilitate.  Courts often refuse to convict for money laundering absent a conviction for a predicate offense.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Albania must implement existing laws effectively and continue to develop the capacity of its police and prosecutors to focus on corruption, money laundering, and economic crimes.  Staffing of the National Bureau of Investigation, which is the investigative arm of SPAK, has suffered delays but is ongoing.  Substantial criminal code reforms in 2016 and 2017 were meant to build a more effective system, but implementation of these reforms is still a challenge.  Despite a sizeable number of money laundering investigations in recent years, the number of related \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  39  prosecutions remains low.  In 2020, 131 new money laundering investigations were opened by the Prosecutor General’s Office; 23 defendants were tried in court, of whom three were convicted.  Additionally, the ASP investigated 375 money laundering crimes and 2,891 financial crimes cases in 2020, leading to over $15 million in sequestered cash and property.  The SPAK, which became operational in December 2019, has registered successes in combating trafficking and organized crime and seizing laundered assets.  The ASP has a dedicated economic crime unit tasked with AML efforts.    Albania had success against organized crime figures in 2020.  Prosecutors confiscated 40 percent of the assets of drug kingpin Klement Balili and seized Ylli Ndroqi’s numerous businesses, including Ora News Media.  Ndroqi, who has strong political ties in Albania, is suspected of organizing narcotics trafficking in Turkey and Italy.  ASP logged 676 allegations of corruption in the first 10 months of 2020, a figure comparable to last year’s statistics.   Algeria  OVERVIEW  The extent of money laundering through Algeria’s formal financial system is understood to be minimal due to stringent regulations and a banking sector dominated by state-owned banks.  Algerian authorities monitor the banking system closely.  The Algerian financial system is highly bureaucratic and provides for numerous checks on all money transfers.  The continued prevalence of archaic, paper-based systems and banking officials not trained to function in the modern international financial system further deters money launderers, who are more likely to use sophisticated transactions.  However, a large informal, cash-based economy, estimated at 40 percent of GDP, is vulnerable to abuse by criminals.  The real estate market is particularly vulnerable to money laundering.   The country is generally making progress in its efforts to combat money laundering and financial crimes.  Over the past several years, the government has updated its criminal laws on terrorist financing and issued new guidelines for the Bank of Algeria and the Ministry of Finance’s Financial Intelligence Processing Unit (CTRF), Algeria’s FIU.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Notable criminal activity includes trafficking, particularly of bulk cash, drugs, cigarettes, arms, and stolen vehicles; theft; extortion; and embezzlement.  Public corruption and terrorism remain serious concerns.  Porous borders allow smuggling to flourish.   The restricted convertibility of the Algerian dinar enables the Bank of Algeria, the central bank, to monitor Algerian banks’ international financial operations.  Money laundering in Algeria occurs primarily outside the formal financial system, through tax evasion, abuse of real estate \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  40  transactions, and commercial invoice fraud.  Cases of customs fraud, the use of offshore tax havens, and incidences of TBML increasingly concern Algerian authorities.  Algeria’s extensive informal economy and nearly exclusive use of cash heighten the risk of financial crimes.   Al-Qaida in the Islamic Maghreb, which operates in parts of Algeria, raises money through drug trafficking and trading, extortion, fees imposed on smugglers, and hostage taking.  Instability in neighboring Libya and Mali threatens the security of Algeria’s borders and provides openings for extremist organizations and transnational criminal networks to gain strength.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  There were no legislative changes noted in 2020.  The following laws are applicable to money laundering in Algeria:  Executive Decree no. 06-05, addressing STR requirements; Executive Decree no. 13-157, on the creation, organization, and functioning of the CTRF; Executive Decree no. 15-153, fixing the thresholds for payments that must be made through the banking and financial systems; and Law no. 16-02, establishing rules for the application of the penal code to AML/CFT.  AML provisions in Algeria impose data collection and due diligence requirements on financial institutions processing wire transfers, with stricter requirements for cooperation with law enforcement authorities, upon request, for transfers exceeding $1,000.  In addition, Algerians must use the formal banking system to complete all payments for certain purchases in excess of the following amounts:  approximately $44,200 for real estate and approximately $8,800 for goods and services.  Noncompliance with these provisions could result in sanctions against the individual and/or financial institution.   Algeria has an MLAT with the United States but not a bilateral extradition treaty.  Algeria is a party to several multilateral law enforcement conventions that also permit mutual legal assistance with the United States.  Provisions in the MLAT provide for asset sharing.    Algeria is a member of the MENAFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://menafatf.org/information-center/menafatf-publications/mutual-evaluation-report-peoples-democratic-republic.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Challenges remain in implementation of Algeria’s AML regime.  Following the ouster of the long-serving president in 2019, an anticorruption campaign was announced, and in 2020 Algeria created a specialized financial crimes unit within the court of Sidi M’Hamed, Algiers, to improve capacity to investigate and prosecute financial crimes.  A self-analysis by the CTRF continues to identify a need to increase the quality of banks’ reporting, although CTRF has noted recent improvements.  While the CTRF has provided some information on the number of cases it is processing, additional information is needed to evaluate implementation of applicable requirements.  The CTRF is engaged in an internal review to identify additional weaknesses.  Only foreign PEPs are covered under EDD requirements.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  41  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The CTRF actively analyzes STRs, compiles and disseminates money laundering trends and typologies to banks, and engages in quantitative and qualitative self-analysis.  The CTRF reported a similar volume of STRs in the first half of 2020 as in 2019.   The CTRF reported a total of 59 money laundering investigations and 39 terrorist financing investigations completed in 2019, leading to 105 convictions, and expects to report a significant increase in successful prosecutions once it finalizes 2020 data.     Antigua and Barbuda  OVERVIEW  Antigua and Barbuda continues to improve its AML regime.  The National Anti-Money Laundering Oversight Committee (NAMLOC) intends to review the country’s legal and supervisory framework for combating drug-related money laundering, including preventative measures, prosecutions, and confiscation.  As of December 2020, the financial sector includes six commercial banks, six international (offshore) banks, six credit unions, 18 insurance companies, five offshore money remitters, six payday money lenders, three internet gaming entities, four casinos, and 37 citizenship-by-investment program agents.  As of December 2016, the offshore sector hosted 5,102 IBCs, of which 3,635 were active.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Corruption, drug trafficking, and fraud are the major sources of illicit funds.  The majority of corruption cases addressed by law enforcement are in response to letters of request received from foreign jurisdictions.  Front operations, wire transfers, and structuring deposits are the main means of money laundering.    Antigua and Barbuda has one small FTZ that is not believed to be involved in money laundering activity.  AML experts identify international banks, MSBs, and the insurance sector as the most vulnerable sectors.  The country reports that international banks contribute less than 0.5 percent of GDP.   Three narcotics investigations in 2020 revealed the use of MSBs to send funds to North America for suspected drug purchases.  In addition, the cases revealed the involvement of third parties who controlled the funds and who utilized cash-based businesses to obfuscate the illicit origin of funds.  The Citizenship by Investment Program grants citizenship to people who make an economic contribution following background checks to ensure they have no criminal record or pending charges and are not, or have not been, suspected of or associated with any terrorist activity.  There are four investment options:  a contribution to the National Development Fund, a contribution to the University of the West Indies Fund, an investment into an approved real \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  42  estate project, or an investment directly into an eligible business.  Nationals of Iran, Iraq, North Korea, Yemen, Somalia, and Sudan are disqualified from applying.  However, individuals born in these restricted countries who migrated before the age of majority and/or have maintained permanent residence in any country other than those on the restricted list for a period of not less than 10 years can apply, provided they do not maintain economic ties to any restricted country.  Authorities are implementing changes to the program after international experts rated the money laundering/terrorist financing risk to the program as medium-high due to a lack of compliance supervision, lack of formal requirements to conduct money laundering/terrorist financing risk assessments, limited audit functions, and a lack of documented policy.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Money Laundering Protection Act, the Money Laundering (Prevention) Regulations 2017, and the Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism Guidelines form the legal AML framework of the country.  This framework imposes obligations on financial institutions and DNFBPs to create AML policies and internal controls; to implement KYC, record keeping, and STR reporting procedures; and to develop staff vetting and training programs.  The statutes also create the framework for law enforcement measures, including investigations, seizures, forfeitures, and confiscations.  The country has EDD for PEPs.  The Office of National Drug and Money Laundering Control Policy (ONDCP) Act 2020 adds provisions to enhance and clarify the ONDCP’s ability to obtain and share information relating to money laundering offenses.   The Electronic Crimes Act 2020 introduces the requirement for law enforcement agencies such as the police, customs, and the ONDCP to obtain warrants to search the contents of electronic devices.  The Prevention of Terrorism Act 2020 enhances the powers of the Attorney General when implementing financial sanctions on listed terrorists.  It also provides for receipt of freezing requests from other countries that are not based on UN sanctions lists.   The Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act 2020 contains provisions to improve the effectiveness with which MLAT requests are executed.   Antigua and Barbuda has a bilateral MLAT and a tax information exchange agreement with the United States.    Antigua and Barbuda is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/a-c/antiguaandbarbuda/documents/mutualevaluationofantiguaandbarbuda.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   AML legislation covers legal persons, but the penalties for noncompliance have not been strong deterrents.  Antigua and Barbuda should take steps to strengthen the sanctions for noncompliance \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  43  to make them dissuasive.    International experts have identified AML deficiencies, including the lack of identification and supervision of vulnerable NPOs and registration of all unregulated DNFBPs.  The supervision of DNFBPs is inconsistent and not risk-based.  Except for procedures during the initial licensing of DNFBPs, there are no formal practices to prevent convicted criminals from holding a management function in certain DNFBPs.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The government continues to implement an action plan to address the issues noted in the NRA.  Officials report the NAMLOC and other relevant agencies continue to amend their policies and procedures accordingly.   There are specialized units to investigate money laundering, financial crimes, and specific predicate offenses for money laundering.  Due to the prevailing COVID-19 situation, all onsite examinations and face-to-face training with financial institutions were revised for virtual platforms.  In addition, 2020 AML supervision was adjusted to a virtual/offsite modality.   Antigua and Barbuda implemented a mandatory risk-based approach to AML for financial institutions.  However, many DNFBPs continue to be subject to rules-based supervision.     Argentina   OVERVIEW  Argentina faces significant AML/CFT challenges, including those stemming the tide of illicit proceeds from narcotics trafficking and public corruption.  The Tri-Border Area (TBA), shared with Brazil and Paraguay, is one of the principal routes into Argentina for multi-billion dollar TBML, counterfeiting, drug trafficking, and other smuggling offenses.  In addition, some money laundering organizations in the TBA have suspected links to the terrorist organization Hizballah.  Although moving in the right direction, Argentina is still deficient compared to leading governments in the hemisphere in implementing mechanisms to prevent, detect, investigate, and prosecute money laundering and related crimes.  Since 2016, Argentina has taken significant steps to strengthen its AML/CFT regime, principally by adopting a risk-based approach to AML/CFT compliance supervision and establishing the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing to coordinate the money laundering/terrorist financing NRAs, develop and evaluate the implementation of the national strategy to combat those crimes, and coordinate the development of policies to promote an effective AML/CFT regime.  However, Argentina still has not conducted a money laundering NRA or developed AML/CFT national strategies, and the committee has yet to propose polices to strengthen the AML/CFT regime.  Limited regulatory and criminal enforcement capabilities continue to raise concerns about the government’s ability to reduce significantly the flow of illicit proceeds.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  44  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Contraband smuggling, narcotics trafficking, and public corruption are significant sources of illicit proceeds.  Drug-related crimes have increased in Argentina in the last decade, and Argentina is no longer only a transit country but also a consumer and exporter of narcotics and precursors.  Tax evasion and the sale of counterfeit goods also generate significant revenue.  Various sectors of the economy are vulnerable to exploitation due, in part, to the lack of effective regulatory oversight.  Financial institutions, MVTS businesses, exchange houses, real estate, and gaming are particularly susceptible.    Despite improvements in recent years, Argentina lacks adequate controls at points of entry to prevent cross-border transport of contraband and bulk cash, particularly with respect to outbound enforcement.  Its cash-intensive economy and a large informal sector create additional opportunities for criminals to launder illicit proceeds, and authorities have detected numerous TBML schemes.  Since September 2019, the government has imposed capital controls to restrict the purchase of foreign currency, driving activity into the informal exchange market and increasing use of cash payments.  Narcotraffickers and money launderers use this illegal market to launder illicit money.  In October 2020, security forces arrested a Peruvian narcotrafficker resident in Argentina suspected of laundering more than $35 million through this market over the past year.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Argentina has comprehensive CDD and STR regulations, and both foreign and domestic PEPs are subject to EDD.  In December 2019, the FIU issued a resolution stating all foreign PEPs are considered high risk and subject to EDD.  In 2020, the National Revenue Administration implemented a new regulation requiring legal entities to provide information on beneficial ownership to deter use of these entities for illicit financing activities.  Argentina and the United States have an MLAT and participate in the Argentina-U.S. Dialogue on Illicit Finance, a bilateral initiative to identify and address shared money laundering and terror financing threats and vulnerabilities.  Argentina Customs maintains an active TTU to combat TBML through shared analysis of trade data with the United States.  The FIU is the primary AML/CFT regulator for all reporting entities, including financial institutions, DNFBPs, and other sectors that deal in high-value activities.  The FIU is solely responsible for the application of sanctions for non-compliance with AML/CFT requirements.  Argentina is a member of the FATF and of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER can be found at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/a-c/argentina/documents/mutualevaluationofargentina.html.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  45  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  Despite recent reforms, effective implementation of the AML regime continues to be a challenge.  Argentina has not initiated a money laundering NRA but has completed (but not yet published) its terrorist financing/proliferation financing NRA.    Many DNFBPs have no sectoral regulator, and the FIU does not have the resources to adequately supervise them for AML/CFT compliance.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Argentina needs to continue to strengthen and professionalize its FIU to make effective its AML/CFT strategy.  The FIU has an outsized role in the AML regime based on a lack of interagency coordination, its role as the DNFBP supervisor, and its unique authority to serve as a party to criminal prosecutions on AML/CFT cases.    Argentina has implemented reforms to allow enhanced use of informants, undercover officers, and cooperating witnesses in criminal investigations, though these measures are not yet in widespread use.  Argentina’s money laundering enforcement regime effectiveness, as measured by convictions, asset forfeiture, and regulatory enforcement, is limited.  Systemic deficiencies in Argentina’s justice system persist, including lengthy delays, a lack of judicial and prosecutorial independence, and inexperience among judges and prosecutors in investigating financial crimes.   Armenia  OVERVIEW   Armenia is gradually strengthening its AML legislation and has sharply increased its money laundering investigations and convictions since the 2018 “Velvet Revolution.”  Armenia is aggressively pursuing criminal cases against high-level officials from prior governments and oligarchs connected to them, and thanks to new legislation, can now pursue assets connected to illegal activity in civil court following the establishment of a non-conviction-based asset forfeiture regime.  Armenia’s parliament passed amendments to strict bank secrecy laws that hinder the ability of Armenian investigators to gain access to banking records.  Although the Constitutional Court struck down the amendments, the government is currently working on new draft legislation to address the Constitutional Court’s concerns.  The non-conviction-based asset forfeiture regime and these prospective changes to the bank secrecy laws should provide the Armenian criminal justice system with the authorities and tools to strengthen money laundering investigations and ramp up convictions even further in 2021 and beyond.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  46  VULNERABILITIES AND EXPECTED TYPOLOGIES   Armenia is located on a trade route between narcotics source countries and European and Russian markets.  Armenia maintains control over law enforcement, prosecution, and judiciary functions.  However, Russian border guards are present at Armenia’s borders with Turkey and Iran, where smuggling is known to occur, and Russia provides border control staff at the international airport in Yerevan.    Although the current government is implementing an ambitious anti-corruption program, narcotics smuggling, the shadow economy, significant inflows of remittances from abroad, the hiding of assets within the real estate sector, and the use of cash remain widespread and constitute vulnerabilities.    Armenia has five casinos, regulated by the Ministry of Finance, in addition to various online and virtual gambling establishments.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   The Central Bank of Armenia regulates the financial sector, including the banks that account for about 90 percent of all financial system assets.  The financial sector is required to implement KYC provisions and report suspicious transactions to the Financial Monitoring Center (FMC), Armenia’s FIU.    Requirements concerning KYC, STRs, and EDD for PEPs are stipulated in the AML/CFT Law and the Regulation on Minimum Requirements to Reporting Entities.   The Law of the Republic of Armenia “On Civil Forfeiture of Illegal Assets” took effect on May 23, 2020.  The law addresses proceedings on forfeiture of illegal assets, grounds for initiating actions, bodies which are authorized to initiate and examine forfeiture proceedings, and rules for international cooperation in forfeiture matters.  The Prosecutor General’s Office may file motions with the courts to impose preliminary injunctions against such assets.  Notably, the obligation to deposit security to mitigate any risks of potential damages is waived.  Forfeiture claims can be filed mainly with regard to the proceeds of crimes against property, including economic crimes such as theft, fraud, or bribery.  In forfeiture proceedings assets are presumed to be of illegal origin unless the owner proves the legitimate origin of the assets.  There are no barriers to establishing an asset sharing arrangement with a third country to return assets that an Armenian court decides should be forfeited.  The United States and Armenia signed a Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act intergovernmental agreement in February 2018 that entered into force in July 2019.  There is no MLAT with the United States.  Armenian investigators and prosecutors have received initial training in the writing of mutual legal assistance requests for submission to the U.S. Department of Justice.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  47  Armenia is a member of MONEYVAL, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer-fsrb/MONEYVAL(2015)34_5thR_MER_Armenia.pdf.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Armenia has achieved some progress in its requirements for PEPs, regulation and supervision of DNFBPs, and powers of law enforcement and investigative authorities; however, moderate shortcomings remain.  Legal persons are not subject to criminal penalties for money laundering.       Bank secrecy laws, as currently designed, require investigators to indict a suspect before obtaining banking records, hindering some money laundering investigations.  In January 2020, the parliament adopted amendments to the secrecy law to expand access for investigators, allowing them, with court permission, access to banking information for individuals linked to criminal suspects.  The Constitutional Court struck down the amendments, citing due process issues.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Armenia began a new national risk assessment in early 2020 to address issues raised by international experts.  It expects to complete the assessment in the first quarter of 2021.    Armenian law enforcement has been increasingly active in trying to build money laundering cases since the 2018 revolution.  Between mid-2018 and November 2019, the FIU received inquiries on a total of 200 criminal cases involving elements of money laundering.  That number increased to approximately 700 such investigations from January to October 2020.  These cases were mostly initiated with charges for predicate offenses such as high-profile corruption, embezzlement, tax evasion, theft, and fraud.  A significant number of these investigations target representatives of Armenia’s former regimes and associated oligarchs.    Armenian courts achieved eight convictions on cases with elements of money laundering, including four convictions for stand-alone money laundering offenses, from mid-2018 through the end of 2019.  Although official statistics for 2020 are not yet available, FIU officials expect a higher number of convictions than in the previous year.    Armenia should provide criminal penalties for legal persons involved in money laundering or terrorist financing, ensure all reporting sectors provide mandated financial intelligence reports, criminalize misrepresentation, and create vetting mechanisms to prevent corrupt criminal actors from serving as, owning, or managing DNFPBs.       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  48  Aruba   OVERVIEW   Aruba is not considered a regional financial center.  Because of its location, Aruba is a transshipment point for drugs and gold from South America bound for the United States and Europe, and for currency flowing in both directions.  Aruba is a semi-autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Kingdom).  The Kingdom retains responsibility for foreign policy and defense, including signing international conventions with the approval of the local parliament.  The law enforcement MOU between the four Kingdom countries and the United States for joint training activities and sharing of information includes Aruba.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Bulk cash and gold smuggling represent a risk due to the location of Aruba between North and South America.  Money laundering is primarily related to proceeds from illegal narcotics and gold trafficked by criminal organizations and occurs through gold transfers, real estate purchases, and international tax shelters.  Real estate firms and tax trust companies are subject to KYC provisions and FIU reporting obligations.  There is no significant black market for smuggled goods.   Sanctions against Aruba’s traditional trading partner, Venezuela, and a closed border with Venezuela are negatively affecting Aruba’s economy.  Some Venezuelans who are investing in real estate in Aruba are suspected of using black money.  Aruban law enforcement agencies are continuing to investigate illegal underground banking, money laundering, and cash transfers by Chinese business owners.   The Free Zone Aruba NV has an integrity system in place to deter illegal activities, including smuggling and money laundering, and reviews and controls all companies with free zone status in the FTZs.  Financial services, banks, and insurance companies are not permitted to operate in the free zones.  There are 10 casinos, and online gaming is allowed, subject to KYC provisions and FIU reporting requirements.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Fraud is a crime and counterfeiting and piracy of products are predicate offenses to money laundering.  Licensing is required for a variety of businesses.  KYC laws cover banks, life insurance companies and insurance brokers, money transfer companies, investment companies and brokers, factoring and leasing companies, trust and company service providers, car dealers, casinos, lawyers, civil notaries, accountants, tax advisors, realtors, and dealers in precious metals, stones, and other high-value objects.  In 2020, Aruba temporarily banned gold trading/imports from Venezuela pending legislative approval of a permanent law to regulate the gold trade.   The Kingdom may extend international conventions to the semi-autonomous countries within the Kingdom, though the respective parliaments must approve the conventions for them to become \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  49  law.  The Kingdom extended to Aruba the application of the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 1999 and the UNTOC in 2007.  The Kingdom has also extended to Aruba the application of the Agreement Regarding Mutual Cooperation in the Tracing, Freezing, Seizure, and Forfeiture of the Proceeds and Instrumentalities of Crime and the Sharing of Forfeited Assets, which was signed by the United States and the Kingdom in 1992.  With the Kingdom’s agreement, each entity can be assigned a status of its own within international or regional organizations, subject to the organization’s agreement.  The individual entities may conclude MOUs in areas in which they have autonomy if these MOUs do not infringe on the foreign policy of the Kingdom.  Aruba is a member of the Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.    Aruba is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/aruba-2.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The Kingdom has not yet extended the application of the UNCAC to Aruba.   Reporting entities are not required to give complete identification data for a legal person in an unusual transaction report (UTR) unless the FIU requests additional information.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Aruba does not have an STR system but rather a broader UTR system.  Service providers are required to report large cash transactions of $14,000 or more, wire transactions of $278,000 or more, other unusual transactions, and transactions suspected to be related to money laundering or terrorist financing.   The State Ordinance for the Prevention of and Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing (AML/CFT State Ordinance) includes CDD rules and provisions for the reporting of unusual transactions.  Non-regulated financial service providers (including investment brokers and factoring and leasing companies) and DNFBPs must also comply with the requirements of the AML/CFT state ordinance and must register with the Central Bank of Aruba.   The 2004 U.S.-Netherlands Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement, incorporating specific U.S.-EU provisions, was not extended to Aruba.  The 1981 MLAT between the Kingdom and the United States applies to Aruba and is regularly used by U.S. and Dutch law enforcement agencies for international drug trafficking and money laundering investigations.    The Aruba College of Financial Supervision continued to supervise public finances and financial issues, including money laundering.  Aruba attempted to annul the agreement due to concerns over negative economic impacts, but the governor did not approve the annulment.  In 2020, as one of the Netherlands’ conditions for COVID-19 economic relief, Aruba agreed to a Kingdom consensus law giving the Kingdom more authority to supervise financial issues in the future.     \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  50  Bahamas  OVERVIEW  Due to its proximity to Florida, The Bahamas is a transit point for trafficking in illegal drugs, firearms, and persons to and from the United States.  As an international financial center, the country is vulnerable to money laundering in various sectors, such as financial services, real estate, and casino online gaming.  In 2020, The Bahamas took significant steps toward strengthening its AML regime, including enhanced cooperation agreements among law enforcement and regulatory entities.  The Bahamas has also engaged international donors for technical assistance on implementation of an AML/CFT framework in line with international standards.      VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  The Bahamas traditionally earns approximately 20 percent of GDP through financial services.  The international bank and trust sector, the largest segment of the industry, has over $400 billion in assets under administration.  International and domestic banks and trust companies face exposure to money laundering risks as they conduct a high volume of transactions, handle significant wealth, utilize wire transfers, and provide banking services through channels that vary in anonymity and complexity.  Money transmission businesses are also vulnerable due to the substantial number of small transactions, high numbers of one-off and non-resident customers, and usage by undocumented migrants.  As of November 2020, approximately 60 licensed fund administrators, 733 licensed funds, 351 licensed financial corporate service providers, and 27,072 IBCs were present in The Bahamas.    Emergency powers orders implemented by the government in March 2020 in response to the COVID-19 pandemic effectively shut down casinos, which are restricted to international visitors.  However, The Bahamas faces money laundering challenges related to the online gaming sector, including “web shops” (hybrid online gaming houses), which are restricted to citizens and residents of The Bahamas.  As reported by the central bank, The Bahamas generated $299 million in casino gross revenues (January – March 2020) and $2.3 billion in online gaming sales (January – October 2020), in a country with an overall population of less than 400,000, and in which pandemic-induced unemployment increased from an estimated 10 percent to 40 percent.    On October 23, 2020, The Bahamas launched the world’s first central bank-backed digital currency, the sand dollar.  The sand dollar is stored in a non-interest-bearing digital wallet accessible through mobile devices.  International transactions utilizing the Sand Dollar are not currently possible.   The sand dollar is subject to KYC requirements that vary based on “tiers” of use, with the lowest category (maximum $500 in digital wallet/$1500 in monthly transactions) requiring little documentation.  Higher tiers are subject to stricter KYC procedures.      The country’s only FTZ is the city of Freeport, Grand Bahama, administered and managed by a private entity, the Grand Bahama Port Authority.  The FTZ serves primarily as a manufacturing and transshipment hub.  The government is currently addressing U.S. government concerns regarding container screening measures.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  51  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  While no additional AML laws were passed in 2020, The Bahamas enhanced implementation of the 2019 amended Register of Beneficial Ownership Act (RBOA).  In 2020, the Attorney General’s Office and the FIU implemented a secure search system for accessing online information on beneficial ownership of legal entities registered in The Bahamas.    The 2019 Securities Industry (Anti-Money Laundering and Countering of Terrorism) Rules, and the 2019 Financial Corporate Services Providers (Anti-Money Laundering and Countering of Terrorism) Rules incorporate new and enhanced AML/CFT provisions for licensees and registrants supervised by the Securities Commission of The Bahamas.  In addition, the 2019 Non-Profit Organizations (NPO) Act amendment provides for regulation and supervision of NPOs in line with international standards.  Finally, the 2019 Investment Funds Management Act expands the scope of powers of the Securities Commission and provides measures to protect investors.  The Bahamas exchanges records in connection with narcotics investigations or proceedings pursuant to a bilateral MLAT with the United States.  The Bahamas is a member of the OECD’s Global Forum and has implemented the Common Reporting Standard.    The Bahamas is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/cfatf-4meval-bahamas.pdf.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCES  International experts have stated The Bahamas should continue to work on demonstrating that authorities are investigating and prosecuting all types of money laundering, including cases involving virtual currencies, stand-alone money laundering, and proceeds of foreign offenses such as tax crimes.  Despite significant legal and regulatory progress to date, in 2020, the number of money laundering prosecutions and convictions dropped by 12 percent, on top of a 67 percent drop in 2019, which may indicate a lack of commitment to prosecutions.      ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  There is strong political will to pass legislation related to strengthening the AML/CFT regime, and The Bahamas has implemented a strategic action plan to correct noted deficiencies.  However, effective implementation of enhanced regulations and cooperation continues to pose challenges.  The number of filed STRs continues to be low when compared to the size and scope of the financial sector.  As of October 30, 2020, the FIU received 461 STRs for sectors encompassing $400 billion in assets, up slightly from 454 in 2019.  In addition, the volume of sales generated in the domestic gaming sector in relation to GDP per capita remains an area of concern.     The Identified Risk Framework Steering Committee met weekly in 2020, while the Group of Financial Services Regulators met quarterly. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  52   Barbados   OVERVIEW  Barbados made some progress on its AML system in recent years.  Barbados completed an initial risk assessment identifying drug trafficking as the main source of money laundering in the country and is still completing a more comprehensive NRA amid concerns the previous NRA may not have been sufficient to identify significant national money laundering risks and vulnerabilities.  Barbados has an active international financial services sector.  It does not have FTZs or an economic citizenship program.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Barbados reports the major source of illicit funds is drug trafficking.  National measures taken to address this risk include targeted controls at the points of entry, increased maritime patrols around Barbados, and the better use of available intelligence by competent authorities.  The extensive use of cash in routine business transactions and the commingling of illicit and legitimate funds in the financial system pose additional money laundering challenges.    The Barbados FIU website hosts a page on trends and typologies that includes the misuse of MVTS such as Western Union or MoneyGram.  In some cases that appear to involve funnel accounts, multiple individuals overseas are sending money to one person in Barbados or one person in Barbados is sending money to multiple persons overseas.  The Central Bank of Barbados licenses commercial banks and holding companies, trusts, and merchant banks.  As of October 2019, there are 23 international banks and 10 trust, finance, and merchant banks.  As of December 31, 2015, (the most recent available data), total assets reported by international banks were approximately $41 billion (82 billion Barbadian dollars).  There are no reliable statistics available on the IBC sector.     In addition, the FIU has identified structuring or smurfing, the use of pawnbrokers to sell stolen items, the solicitation of persons to wire funds, and the use of fraudulent documents to obtain loans and other services from financial institutions unlawfully as methods of laundering funds.    There are no casinos in Barbados; however, there are other gaming institutions that are not regulated or supervised for AML/CFT compliance.      KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  In August 2019, Barbados enacted the Proceeds and Instrumentalities of Crime Act, 2019-17, which authorizes civil prosecution of money laundering offenders as well as additional investigative tools such as orders for unexplained wealth and customer information disclosure.  In May 2019, Barbados updated the primary legislation, published as the Money Laundering and Financing of Terrorism (Prevention and Control) (Amendment) Act, 2019-22 (MLFTA).  It \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  53  includes KYC and STR regulations and covers the international financial services sector.    Barbados and the United States have a bilateral MLAT.  Barbados also has a double taxation treaty and a tax information exchange agreement with the United States.   Barbados is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/cfatf-documents/mutual-evaluation-reports/barbados-1/9145-barbados-4th-round-mer/file.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   A new NRA, which could identify additional national money laundering/terrorist financing threats and vulnerabilities, is still being drafted.  To meet international standards, the NRA must address an adequate analysis of terrorist financing risk, transparency of legal persons and arrangements, and the risks associated with trust and corporate service providers and cross-border cash movements.  ENFORCEMENT/ IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  There are several areas Barbados should address in order to align with international best practices, including completing a new NRA, improving the monitoring process of PEPs, correcting technical deficiencies in the enforcement of sanctions, and fostering national cooperation, confiscation and asset forfeiture, transparency, and international cooperation.    The Barbados Royal Police Force (RBPF) Financial Crimes Investigations Unit notes that, for 2020, it continues to conduct joint investigations with the drug squad and other units as necessary.  The RBPF issues cash detention orders where relevant as part of drug-related or other criminal cases and utilizes disclosure and restraint order applications with the High Court as a means of furthering AML investigations.   The Financial Services Commission (FSC) is responsible for the licensing, regulation, and supervision of credit unions and non-bank financial institutions.  The Anti-Money Laundering Authority (AMLA) is in charge of the supervision of certain DNFBPs listed in the MLFTA.  The AMLA and the Financial Services Unit of the Ministry of International Business and Industry (IBFSU) are not able to independently supervise the sectors for which they have supervisory responsibility due to resource and capacity limitations.  Through MOUs, the IBFSU and the AMLA have delegated their supervisory functions to the FSC, which could compromise the FSC’s ability to carry out its own supervisory responsibilities.   Barbados should become a party to the UNCAC.     \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  54  Belgium   OVERVIEW  Belgium’s location and considerable port facilities drive the Belgian economy and have fostered the development of an internationally integrated banking industry.  Belgium’s Port of Antwerp is the second busiest port in Europe, and with this large volume of legitimate trade inevitably comes the trade in illicit goods.  Antwerp is the primary entry point of cocaine into Europe from South American ports.  In 2019, almost 62 tons of cocaine were seized at the Port of Antwerp and 41 tons were seized as of mid-year 2020.        According to Belgium’s FIU, the Financial Information Processing Unit (CTIF), 11 percent of its referrals to judicial authorities were drug-related in 2019, and five percent were related to terrorism and terrorist financing.  CTIF estimates the total amount of illicit funds currently in circulation is more than $3.5 billion.    Given that money laundering techniques have become increasingly sophisticated and criminals have adapted their methods, CTIF introduced new analytical mechanisms in 2018 to improve the flow of information, foster cooperation with the federal prosecutors, and enhance partnerships and analysis of STRs.  In 2019, the number of disclosures of suspicious transactions decreased 22.2 percent in comparison to 2018.  CTIF attributes the drop to improved reporting methods that exclude those STRs that were ultimately deemed to be benign.     VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Belgium is emerging as a primary European repository for bulk cash from drug proceeds.  Multiple crime groups collect bulk cash in Belgium and move it to South American and Asian markets through various means.  The opaque, closed nature of the Antwerp diamond industry inhibits money laundering investigations and provides a cover to launder illicit funds through pre-existing, pseudo-legitimate networks.    Criminal networks increasingly use virtual currencies such as bitcoin to facilitate illegal activity in Belgium.  Fueled primarily by the sale of synthetic drugs via the dark web, virtual currency has become the subject of a growing number of investigations by Belgian police.  Platforms for exchanging virtual currencies and custodian wallet providers are not currently regulated in Belgium because of the lack of a legal depository.  Therefore, virtual currency transactions are not subject to STR requirements.    Gaming is legal in Belgium and is highly regulated, with the total number of licensed casinos limited to nine.  Steady growth in internet gaming continues, but the extent of the activity is currently unknown.  According to CTIF, online gaming is legal, but only if the business operates in a physical establishment in addition to its online presence.  In 2018, CTIF reported the number of “operators of games of chance” at 1,103.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  55  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Fifth European Anti-Money Laundering (AML) Directive entered into force in July 2019, and member states had until January 10, 2020, to implement the directive into national law.  The directive finally was transposed into Belgian law on July 20, 2020.  Belgium has comprehensive KYC rules and STR requirements.  On September 18, 2017, Belgium published implementing legislation for the EU Fourth AML directive, which addresses EDD for domestic PEPs.    Belgium is a member of the FATF.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/a-c/belgium/.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  There are very few reported instances of bulk cash leaving the Port of Antwerp via cargo container.  However, the port’s large size and difficulty effectively analyzing the contents of 11.87 million container-equivalent units (a 6.9 percent increase from 2018) that move through the port each year may help facilitate the movement of illicit goods and funds.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  After the 2015-2016 terrorist attacks in Paris and Brussels, CTIF reported an increase in terrorist financing cases and increased its staff accordingly.  However, additional resources, both human and IT, would enable the CTIF to take a more proactive approach.  The number of STRs from diamond dealers remains low:  in 2019, CTIF received only 15 STRs (down from 18 in 2018, but up from 11 in 2017).  Considering its size and vulnerability to money laundering activity, increased supervision of the diamond industry, including efforts to promote STR filings by diamond dealers, is encouraged.    The CTIF is working with regional and international partners to address the need for surveillance and control with respect to new financial technologies and virtual currencies.   Belize   OVERVIEW  Belize’s AML/CFT laws are in line with international standards, and the government is working to implement its AML/CFT regime across all sectors and institutions.  Substantial money laundering vulnerabilities exist, but Belize shows strong political commitment to address vulnerabilities and fully meet its AML/CFT obligations.  Efforts to identify and address cross-border movement of currency, particularly in FTZs; to strengthen investigative and prosecutorial capacity; and to increase corporate engagement with stakeholders continue.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  56  Administration of the Companies and Corporate Affairs Registry (CCAR) transferred to the Ministry of Finance to enhance its operations, to improve the availability of company information; and to facilitate consolidation of the domestic and international company acts by December 2021.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Drug and contraband trafficking, tax evasion, fraud, bribery, and corruption all contribute to money laundering activity.  Part of the tax evasion issue reflects inconsistencies and lack of clear direction regarding general sales tax arrangements.  Belize remains a cash economy.  The two FTZs are managed entirely by the private sector and deal in cash.  The FIU and the central bank launched a project to review cross-border currency movements in the FTZs.   The FIU currently supervises 1,143 DNFBPs operating in 10 business sectors, with FTZ businesses, NPOs, real estate agents, and vehicle dealers holding the most individual registrations.  FIU-led examinations identified AML/CFT operational weaknesses and deficiencies in most of these entities.  Constrained by a small compliance staff, the FIU expanded its support/engagement with all DNFBPs; this program is now conducted virtually due to COVID-19.  As of December 2019, the IBC registry has 35,730 registered, active IBCs; 1,967 trusts are registered at the International Trust Registry; and 111 foundations are active.  The four international banks operating in Belize are regulated by the Central Bank of Belize.  The International Financial Services Commission (IFSC) supervises offshore entities.  IFSC lists all offshore entities on its website.  The IFSC faces challenges in supervising the large number of entities.  Collaboration is underway with other supervisory authorities to address this concern.  Legislative reforms brought IBCs within the domestic tax jurisdiction.      Six casinos operate in Belize, with annual revenues estimated at $30 million.  Additionally, there are 32 other gaming establishments and one online gaming license.  While the Gaming Control Board (GCB) regulates the gaming entities for prudential purposes, the FIU supervises the gaming sector for AML compliance.  The GCB does not have a public list of gaming companies, but the Ministry of Investment, which houses it, keeps a list of licensed entities.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Belize has a comprehensive AML legal, policy, and regulatory framework and CDD and STR requirements.  The AML/CFT Code of Practice covers legal persons and provides for EDD for PEPs.    In January 2020, the Government of Belize enacted the International Financial Services Commission (Licensing) (Amendment) Regulations and the International Financial Services Commission (Capital Requirement) Regulations.  The regulations set minimum capital reserve requirements for entities.  In June 2020, Belize enacted the International Financial Services Commission (Managing Agents) Regulations, establishing a legal framework for IBCs and \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  57  regulated entities to outsource management services to agents licensed and supervised by the IFSC.   Belize enacted the Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Amendment) Act and the Mutual Administrative Assistance in Tax Matters (Automatic Exchange of Country-By-Country Reports) Regulations in January and April 2020, respectively, establishing tax transparency obligations and requiring sharing of country reports within the OECD framework.  In addition, the 2019 Economic Substance Act mandates that certain financial entities and businesses have “substantial economic presence in Belize” and conduct their “core income generating activities” in Belize.    Belize is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/belize-2.  AML LEGAL, POLICY AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  The lack of national capacity and resources for financial crime investigations, including asset forfeiture, remains a major deficiency in the government’s AML program.  Belize does not have a non-conviction-based forfeiture regime for forms of property other than cash.  The Financial Crimes Working Group (FCWG), a sub-committee of the National Anti-Money Laundering Committee (NAMLC), facilitates a multi-agency approach to financial crimes investigations.  It currently manages 12 cases, with five before the courts.  In October 2020, the NAMLC approved the establishment of an Asset Recovery Forum within the FCWG to pursue criminals and their assets through the collective efforts of the cooperating agencies.   The domestic CCAR and several relevant laws were amended to transfer the administration of the registry to the Ministry of Finance.  Efforts to digitize companies’ registry records and facilitate an e-registry began.  Plans to merge the Companies Act with the International Business Companies Act to create one consolidated act and registry are underway.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The political and administrative will to combat money laundering remains strong as evidenced by continued resource flows despite cutbacks due to COVID-19.  The FIU continues to foster relationships with foreign counterparts.  The FIU now receives STRs electronically because of COVID-19 restrictions and is evaluating new case management software.  Current investigations include 23 cases brought forward from 2019 and seven new cases opened in 2020, with one before the court.  Two applications for cash detention orders are also before the court.  In January 2020, there was one arrest for “suppression of documents, concealment of documents, failure to disclose, failure to assist, obstruction, and giving false information.”  In February 2020, charges were levied on a previously-charged person for “obtaining money transfers by deception.”       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  58  Benin   OVERVIEW  Benin’s main east-west road forms part of the high-volume Abidjan-Lagos transportation corridor and the Port of Cotonou is a shipping hub for the sub-region, serving Nigeria and land-locked countries in the Sahel.  Criminal networks exploit the volume of goods and people moving through Benin.  Nigeria’s unilateral closure of its borders in August 2019 significantly disrupted formal trade, though many goods, including gasoline and food products, continue to be smuggled across the border.  Benin is a transit point for a significant volume of drugs and precursors moving from South America, Pakistan, and Nigeria into Europe, Southeast Asia, and South Africa.  It is difficult to estimate the extent of drug-related money laundering in Benin, believed to be done through the purchase or construction of real estate for rent or re-sale, casinos, bulk cash smuggling, and payments to officials.   Benin has taken measures to uncover and enforce financial aspects of criminal cases in recent years, including creating a specialized court for financial crimes in 2018 and lifting the statute of limitations for financial crimes in 2020.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Open borders, the prevalence of cash transactions, and the informal economy facilitate money laundering in Benin.    Benin is vulnerable to drug-related money laundering.  Cases linked to Benin include the proceeds of narcotics trafficking comingled with revenue from the sale of imported used cars for customers in neighboring countries.  In the past, Benin was implicated in large international schemes in which Lebanese financial institutions were used to launder and move criminal proceeds through West Africa and back into Lebanon.  Hizballah, which the U.S. Department of State has designated as a Foreign Terrorist Organization, reportedly received financial support from this network.   Open sources indicate there are seven casinos in Benin.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The National Assembly passed Act 2018-17, drafted by the West African Economic and Monetary Union (UEMOA) to standardize AML/CFT legislation among member countries and facilitate information sharing.  The June 2018 law replaces 1997 and 2016 laws criminalizing money laundering and the 2012 financing of terrorism law by combining their provisions into a single, uniform law.  The law also addresses deficiencies in earlier legislation by introducing new investigative authorities; requiring attorneys, notaries, banks, and certain non-governmental and religious organizations to report large cash transactions; and codifying additional money laundering predicate offenses. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  59  Benin recently amended its criminal procedure code to lift the statute of limitations on financial crimes and incorporate legal cooperation provisions into its domestic law.  The National Assembly passed Act 2018-13 on May 18, 2018, creating the Court for the Repression of Economic Crimes and Terrorism.  A February 20, 2020 modification to the law enumerates individual crimes under the court’s jurisdiction, including money laundering and illicit enrichment.    The President of Benin and the Ministers of Finance, Interior, and Justice signed ministerial decree number 46 in January 2019 specifying the powers, organization, and function of the Advisory Committee on the Freezing of Assets.  Benin is a member of the GIABA, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.giaba.org/reports/mutual-evaluation/Benin.html.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  Benin’s measures to identify legal owners do not comply with international standards for the identification of beneficial ownership and accurate and up-to-date recordkeeping.   There are no bilateral mutual legal assistance or extradition treaties between Benin and the United States.  Benin is a party to multilateral conventions that support international cooperation on money laundering cases.  ENFORCEMENT/ IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Beninese officials have limited capacity to effectively track financial flows, inhibiting their ability to investigate and prosecute individuals or groups under the country’s legal regime.   The West African Central Bank (BCEAO), which regulates the common West African CFA franc currency, sets a requirement for declaration of bulk cash crossing the border to Nigeria (a non-UEMOA member country) at approximately $8,950 (CFA franc 5,000,000) or more.  Benin customs authorities lack training to evaluate cross-border currency declarations for money laundering purposes.    The National Financial Intelligence Processing Unit (CENTIF), Benin’s FIU, is under-resourced, and agents within this office and other law enforcement offices are often reassigned to new jurisdictions and new disciplines after training investments by donors.  Insufficient funding for day-to-day operations hinders travel to conduct investigations.  CENTIF has requested support from donors to implement recommendations by international AML experts.  CENTIF has limited funds for international travel to Egmont meetings.  On the judicial side, investigating judges lack specialized training in complex financial schemes and cases sit unattended.  Out of 570 statements of suspicion recorded between January and October 2020, 59 were presented to the court, 15 were dismissed, and 44 are still pending.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  60  Bolivia   OVERVIEW  Bolivia is not a regional financial center but remains vulnerable to money laundering.  Criminal proceeds laundered in Bolivia are derived primarily from smuggling contraband and the drug trade.  In recent years, Bolivia has enacted several laws and regulations that, taken together, should help the country more actively fight money laundering.  Bolivia should continue its implementation of its laws and regulations with the goal of identifying criminal activity that results in investigations, criminal prosecutions, and convictions.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Major sources of illicit funds in Bolivia include cocaine trafficking, smuggled goods, corruption, illegal gold mining, and informal currency exchanges.  Chile and Peru are the primary entry points for illicit products, which are then sold domestically or informally exported.  The latest White House Office of National Drug Control Policy report found Bolivia had the potential to produce 301 metric tons of cocaine in 2019, a significant source of illicit profits.  Informal gold mining also has grown in recent years.  Although informal currency exchange businesses and non-registered currency exchanges are illegal, many still operate.  Corruption is common in informal commercial markets and money laundering activity is likely.   Bolivia has 13 FTZs for commercial and industrial use in El Alto, Cochabamba, Santa Cruz, Oruro, Puerto Aguirre, Desaguadero, and Cobija.  Lack of regulatory oversight of these FTZs increases money laundering vulnerabilities.   A few legal casinos pay a hefty percentage to the government in order to run card games, roulette, slots, and bingo.  Many illegal casinos operate in the informal market.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Bolivia passed several laws to control the entry and exit of foreign exchange and criminalize illicit gains.  The National Council to Combat Illicit Laundering of Profits issues guidelines and policies to combat money laundering.  Regulatory procedures allow for freezing and confiscation of funds and other assets related to money laundering.   All financial institutions in Bolivia are required by the Financial Investigative Unit (UIF), Bolivia’s FIU, and banking regulations to report all transactions above $3,000 ($10,000 for banks).   Bolivia has KYC regulations.  All transactions conducted through the financial system require valid photo identification in addition to other required information.  Financial intermediaries must enter this information into their systems, regardless of the transaction amount or whether the transaction is a deposit or a withdrawal.  Private banks follow KYC international standards.   Bolivia does not have a MLAT with the United States; however, various multilateral conventions \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  61  to which both countries are signatories are used for requesting mutual legal assistance.  U.S. CBP, U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), and Bolivian National Customs signed a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement in 2017 that expands cooperation and information sharing, including in the area of money laundering, and provides for the sharing of forfeited assets.  Under that agreement, in November 2020, Bolivia signed an MOU with ICE’s TTU to exchange trade data for the purpose of better identifying TBML.  Bolivia is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available in Spanish only at:  https://www.gafilat.org/index.php/es/biblioteca-virtual/miembros/bolivia/evaluaciones-mutuas-1.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Lack of personnel in the UIF, combined with inadequate resources and weaknesses in Bolivia’s legal and regulatory framework, limit the UIF’s reach and effectiveness.  Compliance with UIF’s reporting requirements is extremely low.  Information exchange between the UIF and police investigative entities has improved in the last few years, and the UIF maintains a database of suspect persons that financial entities must check before conducting business with clients.   Bolivia is in the process of including notaries under the supervision of UIF and is working to address other noted deficiencies, including vehicle dealers, real estate businesses, and jewelry stores, as well as virtual currency, mobile device payments, and financial outflows.   In 2017, the Central Bank of Bolivia prohibited the use of bitcoin and 11 other virtual currencies.  The regulation bans the use of any digital currency not regulated by a country or economic zone.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The Bolivian justice system is hindered by corruption, political interference, and a lack of interagency cooperation, which impede the fight against narcotics-related money laundering.  The lack of well-trained prosecutors and police officers has also been a problem, leading to ineffective criminal investigations.  In 2017, the attorney general created a special unit dedicated to investigating and prosecuting money laundering.   The Bolivian criminal courts have jurisdiction over crimes related to narcotics, terrorism, and money laundering.  With a legal order, courts can request information from banks for investigative purposes.   Bolivia has an extradition treaty with the United States.  In some instances, the Bolivian government has been cooperative with U.S. law enforcement.  Overall, there has been little law enforcement cooperation between Bolivia and the United States in recent years.    According to the most recent data available, there were approximately 51 money laundering-related prosecutions in 2018.  No data has been published for 2019.  Conviction data is not available.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  62  Banks are actively enforcing all regulations to control money laundering or any other suspicious transaction.    Brazil  OVERVIEW   Brazil’s economy remains the second largest in the Western Hemisphere in 2020.  Brazil is a major drug transit country and one of the world’s largest drug consumers.  Transnational criminal organizations operate throughout Brazil and launder proceeds from trafficking operations and contraband smuggling.  A multi-billion dollar contraband trade occurs in the Tri-Border Area (TBA) where Brazil shares borders with Paraguay and Argentina.  Illicit networks in the TBA provide financial support to Hizballah, a U.S. Department of State-designated Foreign Terrorist Organization and a U.S. Department of the Treasury Specially Designated Global Terrorist.  Organized crime (including public corruption) is law enforcement’s primary money laundering priority, followed by weapons and narcotics trafficking.   In February 2019, Brazil’s congress passed legislation to remedy CFT deficiencies.  In December 2019, Brazil’s congress confirmed the president’s executive order that moved Brazil’s FIU, the Council for Financial Activities Control (COAF), from the Ministry of Economy to the central bank.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Public corruption, human smuggling, and trafficking of drugs, weapons, and counterfeit goods are the primary sources of illicit funds.  Money laundering methods include the use of banks, real estate, and financial asset markets; remittance networks; shell companies; phantom accounts; illegal gaming; informal financial networks; and the sale of cars, cattle, racehorses, artwork, and other luxury goods.  Criminals also use foreign tax havens to launder illicit gains.  Drug trafficking organizations are linked to black market money exchange operators.  In large urban centers, laundering techniques often involve foreign bank accounts, shell companies, TBML, and financial assets; while in rural areas, promissory notes and factoring operations are more common.   Some high-priced goods in the TBA are paid for in U.S. dollars, and cross-border bulk cash smuggling is a concern.  Large sums of U.S. dollars generated from licit and suspected illicit commercial activity are transported physically from Paraguay into Brazil.  From there, the money may make its way to banking centers in the United States.   Brazilian law enforcement information and other reporting suggest the nation’s largest criminal organization, Primeiro Comando da Capital (PCC), a sophisticated transnational criminal organization with ties to several countries in the Western Hemisphere and Europe, is moving into money laundering and other less visible criminal enterprises.  According to a recent InSight Crime Institute study, there are concerns the PCC is actively seeking illicit support at the municipal level.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  63   Since 2014, “Operation Carwash” has uncovered a complex web of corruption, bribery, money laundering, illegal campaign contributions, and tax evasion spanning the Americas, leading to arrests and convictions of the former president, former ministers, members of congress, political party operatives, employees at parastatals, and executives at major private construction firms throughout the region. According to the Ministry of Justice and Public Security, close to $400 million (2.1 billion reals) of illicit funds have been blocked overseas; Brazil has recovered over $20 million thus far.   Brazil’s Manaus FTZ is composed of five free trade areas. Brazil also has several export processing zones.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Brazil’s money laundering legal framework was last updated in 2019, when its congress passed the CFT law.  The framework facilitates the discovery, freezing, and forfeiture of illicit assets, and the CFT law addresses implementation of targeted sanctions for designated terrorist financiers.  Brazil has comprehensive KYC and STR regulations.  Brazil maintains some control of capital flows and requires disclosure of corporate ownership.   Brazil and the United States have a customs mutual assistant agreement and an MLAT.  Brazil regularly exchanges trade and financial records with the United States and other jurisdictions.   Brazil is a member of the FATF and the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/a-c/brazil/documents/mutualevaluationreportofbrazil.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Legal entities cannot be criminally charged under Brazil’s money laundering statute.  Legal entities in violation of the reporting requirements can face fines and suspension of operation, and managers can face criminal sanctions.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Brazil is currently drafting its NRA.  Comprehensive data on criminal investigations and convictions in 2020 are not yet available.   Brazilian law enforcement has successfully seized millions in multiple currencies in highway seizures, especially on the border with Paraguay.  The lack of a central de-confliction database, coupled with the stove-piping of intelligence by multiple Brazilian law enforcement agencies, makes it difficult to fully identify the means through which criminal groups launder money.  Coordination among civilian security agencies, law enforcement agencies, and the Brazilian military is hindered by inter-service rivalries.  However, Brazil made significant strides in strengthening its legal framework, building capacity to investigate and prosecute financial crimes \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  64  through specialized police units and courts, and fostering interagency cooperation and civil society input on prospective reforms.  Nonetheless, challenges remain.  Judicial delays often lead to cases expiring before judgment due to strict statutes of limitations.  Brazil will benefit from expanded use of the task-force model and cooperative agreements that facilitated recent major anticorruption breakthroughs, an increased information exchange on best practices, government contract oversight, and collaboration and leniency agreements.  In November 2019, Brazil launched the Integrated Border Operation Center in Foz do Iguaçu in the TBA, which was based in part on U.S. fusion center models.   British Virgin Islands   OVERVIEW  The British Virgin Islands (BVI) is a UK overseas territory with an economy dependent on tourism and financial services.  The BVI is a sophisticated financial center offering accounting, banking, and legal services, captive insurance, company incorporations, mutual funds administration, trust formation, and shipping registration.  As of June 2020, the commercial banking sector had assets valued at approximately $2.28 billion.  BVI has committed to complying with OECD and EU rules on financial transparency and regulation.  It has adopted global standards for automatic exchange between jurisdictions of taxpayer financial account information.  Potential misuse of BVI corporate vehicles remains a concern, but the government has put in place frameworks to guard against such abuse.  Criminal proceeds laundered in the BVI derive primarily from domestic criminal activity and narcotics trafficking.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  The BVI has a favorable corporate tax and no wealth, capital gains, or estate tax.  Significant money laundering risks include exploitation of financial services and a share structure that does not require a statement of authorized capital.  The BVI is a favored destination for incorporating new companies, which can be established for little money in a short amount of time.  Multiple reports indicate a substantial percentage of BVI’s offshore business comes from Asia.  Financial services account for over half of government revenues.  The Financial Services Commission’s (FSC) June 2020 statistical bulletin notes there are 375,832 companies.  Of these, 1,120 are private trust companies.  There are six commercially licensed banks, 1431 registered mutual funds, and 48 registered closed-ended funds referred to as “private investment funds.”  The BVI’s proximity to the U.S. Virgin Islands and use of the U.S. dollar as its currency pose additional risk factors for money laundering.  The BVI, like other jurisdictions in the Eastern Caribbean, is a major target for drug traffickers, who use the area as a gateway to the United States.  BVI authorities work with regional and U.S. law enforcement agencies to mitigate these threats.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  65  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Money laundering is criminalized, as are all money laundering predicate offenses, in line with international standards.  Maximum criminal penalties for money laundering and related offenses are $500,000 and 14 years in prison.  Administrative penalties are a maximum of $100,000.  The maximum penalty under the Anti-Money Laundering Regulations is $150,000.  The FSC is the sole supervisory authority responsible for the licensing and supervision of financial institutions.  The Financial Investigation Agency (FIA) is the supervisory authority responsible for ensuring compliance of DNFBPs with AML/CFT legislation.  KYC and STR requirements cover banks, money service and financing businesses, insurance companies, investment businesses, insolvency practitioners, trust and company service providers, attorneys, notaries public, accountants, auditors, yacht and auto dealers, real estate agents, dealers in precious stones and metals, dealers in other high-value goods, and NPOs.  The BVI applies EDD procedures to PEPs.  Part III of the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Code of Practice 2008 outlines the KYC procedures that licensees should follow to ensure proper verification of clients.  In 2020, the government agreed to amend the FIA Act to include authority for the FIA to enforce AML regulations on non-compliant DNFBPs.  The BVI is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/documents/mutual-evaluation-reports/virgin-islands-1.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  International experts have criticized the BVI’s AML supervision, particularly of the company formation sector, and its sanctions regime, though there have been recent improvements.  In 2019, the BVI Financial Services Commission Enforcement Committee reviewed 75 enforcement cases of suspected breaches of financial services legislation and issued a total of 16 penalties, including monetary administrative penalties, five directives, and seven warning letters.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The UK is responsible for the BVI’s international affairs, save those matters that may be delegated under the Virgin Islands Constitution Order 2007.  The UK arranged for the extension to the BVI of the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 1995, the UNCAC in 2006, and the UNTOC in 2012.  The BVI established a register that provides authorized BVI authorities direct and immediate beneficial ownership information; this registry is not publicly available.  Beneficial ownership information must be shared with UK law enforcement and other agencies within 24 hours of a request (or one hour in urgent cases).  The BVI has committed to introducing a publicly accessible register of the beneficial ownership of companies registered in its jurisdiction. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  66  In 2019, 10 money laundering-related prosecutions were filed.  Information for 2020 is not available.    Updates to the territory’s Anti-Money Laundering Regulations and Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Code of Practice will continue to be made in the coming year to further complete reforms necessary to ensure compliance with international AML/CFT standards.    Burma   OVERVIEW  Burma remains vulnerable to money laundering due to its sizable illicit economy and weak banking sector.  In 2020, the government continued to make progress on improving its AML regulatory framework and enforcement.  Burma issued new AML guidelines and worked to implement 2019 AML regulations on CDD and supervision of remittance service providers.    Burma is designated as a jurisdiction of “primary money laundering concern” under Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act, but the Department of the Treasury began waiving the legal ramifications in 2012 and issued an administrative exception in 2016, allowing U.S. financial institutions to provide correspondent services to Burmese banks.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Burma is still largely a cash-based economy.  Burma continues to struggle with a significant illicit economy that includes products such as gemstones, timber, and narcotics and likely generates billions of dollars per year, much of which fuels internal conflicts.  The banking system suffered from an absence of effective prudential regulation by the Central Bank of Myanmar (CBM) during the former military regime, which is slowly being improved.  The government's inability to exercise sovereign control in its border regions due to continuing civil conflict presents money laundering vulnerabilities due to the proliferation of casinos, remittance networks, and drug trafficking in those border areas.    Casinos target foreigners in border towns, especially near China and Thailand.  Little information is available about the scale of these enterprises.  The Burmese government enacted a gaming law in 2019, requiring domestic casinos to register as companies.  Illegal and informal gaming occurs through lotteries and card games.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Government of Burma did not enact any new AML legislation in 2020.  The country’s Anti-Money Laundering Act, passed in 2014, is the foundational legislation.  In 2019, the government issued two AML regulations - on CDD and remittance agents – to complement the 2014 law.    In early 2020, the Government of Burma issued a Risk-based Supervision Guide to steer the CBM’s supervision activities, and the CBM also updated the Onsite Anti-Money \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  67  Laundering/Counter-Terrorist Financing Supervision Handbook, based on the 2019 CDD regulations.  Additionally, the Burmese government began revising its AML law to increase conformity with international standards.  Also in 2020, the Ministry of Home Affairs – which houses the Myanmar Financial Intelligence Unit (MFIU) – drafted guidelines specifically to cover coordination among the Myanmar Bureau of Special Investigations, the MFIU, and the Union Attorney General's Office.  This set of rules, called Cooperation and Coordination Guidelines on Investigations and Prosecutions of Money Laundering Cases, is expected to be issued in early 2021.  Burma does not have a bilateral MLAT with the United States.  Burma is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/j-m/myanmar/documents/mer-myanmar-2018.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Shortfalls in Burma’s AML regime include limited understanding of obligations among financial institutions and DNFBPs, including casinos; poor reporting in STRs; and weak central bank oversight of DNFBPs.  Additional deficiencies are noted in the lack of clear obligations and countermeasures toward designated higher-risk countries, transparency in beneficial ownership requirements and information, and CBM supervision and enforcement of hundi services’ compliance with AML regulations.   The MFIU is not a member of the Egmont Group.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  In line with the 2019 KYC regulations, the CBM performed examinations on 18 private banks between December 2019 and August 2020.  In March 2020, the CBM revoked a bank license because the source of funds for share trading and capital came from illegal sources.  The CBM also trained over 50 compliance officers for remittance/money transfer companies.  In line with the 2019 regulations on remittance service providers or hundi services, CBM will issue licenses to nine remittance businesses in late 2020, thereby bringing them under regulatory supervision.    Burma’s technical capacity to effectively implement and enforce AML regulations and practices continues to remain limited.  Specifically, significant gaps in Burma’s ability to oversee informal money transfer entities and to prosecute any such entities engaged in illegal activity persist, and there remains a lack of clear authorities and obligations with certain parts of beneficial ownership requirements.  Additionally, Burma largely lacks international-standard training on data collection and analysis as well as investigations and prosecutions.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  68  Cabo Verde  OVERVIEW  Cabo Verde’s 10 dispersed islands in the mid-Atlantic and minimal capacity to patrol its territorial waters make it vulnerable to narcotics trafficking from the Americas to Europe and West Africa, and to other illicit maritime activity.  Its financial system is primarily composed of the banking sector.  Although Cabo Verde’s AML regime has flaws, the government has revised its laws, policies, and regulations to create the tools to curb illicit financial activities.  Cabo Verde receives international support to fight drug trafficking, money laundering, and other crimes.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Cabo Verde’s informal sector, which made up approximately 30 percent of the country’s economy before the COVID-19 pandemic, contributes to financial vulnerabilities.  Although the formal financial sector enjoys a strong reputation, it may still offer niches to criminals.  The biggest money laundering risk is likely related to narcotics trafficking, largely due to Cabo Verde’s location and its limited capacity to patrol its large maritime territory.  Narcotics transit Cabo Verde by commercial aircraft and maritime vessels, including private yachts.  Although data is limited, domestic drug use appears to be increasing.  The ongoing development of a casino by a major third-country entity also increases Cabo Verde’s potential exposure to money laundering.  Prosecutors seldom pursue criminal charges against accused counterfeiters and intellectual property thieves.  The high profits, low risk, and inadequate penalties for trademark counterfeiting and copyright piracy likely have made those activities increasingly attractive to organized criminal groups as imports have shrunk and supply chains have slowed due to the pandemic.  Public corruption is limited in Cabo Verde and is unlikely to facilitate money laundering.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Cabo Verde’s AML/CFT framework has been in place since 2009.  The government has continued to make progress in operationalizing it and improving national cooperation and coordination.  In a typical case, the FIU identifies suspicious transactions and provides the relevant information to the Prosecutor General’s office (PGR).  If the PGR determines further investigation is warranted, the Judicial Police engages via an interagency task force on money laundering and asset recovery.  The central bank (BCV) regulates and supervises the financial sector, and commercial banks generally comply with its rules.  Financial institutions reportedly exercise due diligence beyond the requirements of the law for both domestic and foreign PEPs.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  69  Cabo Verde has taken steps to implement a cross-border currency declaration regime.  The General Inspectorate of Economic Affairs serves as the supervisory body for dealers in luxury items; the Inspector General for Gaming, which currently sits in the Ministry of Tourism, supervises Cabo Verde’s gaming.  The United States and Cabo Verde do not have a bilateral MLAT or an extradition treaty.  Cabo Verde is party to relevant multilateral conventions that allow for international law enforcement cooperation, including extradition.    Cabo Verde is a member of the GIABA, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.giaba.org/reports/mutual-evaluation/Cabo%20Verde.html.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  Limited information is available about the degree to which the BCV conducts AML compliance examinations of financial institutions under its jurisdiction or has applied administrative sanctions for noncompliance.  Cabo Verde needs to further strengthen its AML supervision mechanisms for financial institutions, capital markets, and DNFBPs, including the gaming sector.  Limited staffing at the FIU limits the agency’s ability to track and report suspicious transactions.  The FIU is working to improve its efficiency and effectiveness, including through donor assistance.  It led the effort to create uniform DNFPB governance standards consistent with international best practices.  A pilot group formed in 2019 has concentrated its efforts on four areas:  assessing the legal framework, training, resource allocation, and standardized documentation.  The group’s stakeholders include the FIU and agencies overseeing the real estate, accountant, notary, and NGO sectors.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Despite its achievements, Cabo Verde still needs to close important gaps.  Among those are the development of a fully and broadly functioning cross-border currency declaration system and a record of tangible outcomes.  There remains a general lack of understanding across agencies and civil society about the intersection of money laundering and transnational organized crime elements active in Cabo Verde, including in the gaming sector.  At the policy level, the ministers of justice and finance established an inter-ministerial commission to replace the Financial Crimes Working Group to leverage existing legal structures.  The commission coordinates Cabo Verde’s AML policy to bring it into line with international frameworks and standards.    In recent years, Cabo Verde has recruited additional public prosecutors, and the BCV has recruited more agents for its supervision department.       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  70  Canada   OVERVIEW  Money laundering in Canada involves the proceeds of illegal drug trafficking, fraud, corruption, counterfeiting and piracy, and tobacco smuggling and trafficking, among others.  Foreign-generated proceeds of crime are laundered in Canada, and professional, third-party money laundering is a key concern.  Transnational organized crime groups and professional money launderers are key threat actors.   The Canadian government is funding a forensic accountant team to aid investigations and prosecutions and has established two mechanisms to coordinate across agencies and better address TBML.  Canada’s privacy laws have deterred financial institutions’ willingness to share information with government entities, but the FIU is using public-private partnerships (PPPs) with large financial institutions to address this deficiency.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Criminals launder money via several mediums, including bulk cash smuggling, MSBs/currency exchanges, casinos, real estate, luxury vehicles, wire transfers, offshore corporations, credit cards, foreign accounts, funnel accounts, hawala networks, and virtual currencies.   Illicit drugs represent the largest criminal market in Canada.  Transnational organized crime groups (OCG) are the most threatening and sophisticated actors, given their access to international money laundering networks and facilitators and diverse money laundering methods.  Law enforcement efforts to target a particular money laundering practice, such as TBML, generally result in a shift in OCG methodology, rather than an interruption in the illicit activity.  The provinces operate online casinos and table games.  According to a 2017 study, the industry produced approximately $13.3 billion (17.1 billion Canadian dollars) in gaming revenue.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Canada’s two main laws addressing money laundering and terrorist financing are the criminal code and the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act (PCMLTFA).  Canada’s department of finance published multiple amendments to the PCMLTFA in July 2019.  Regulatory amendments that took effect June 1, 2020, now require MSBs dealing in virtual currencies to comply with AML requirements and register with the Financial Transactions and Reports Analysis Centre (FINTRAC), Canada’s FIU.  Foreign MSBs also must fulfill new AML compliance measures, including reporting transactions, CDD, record keeping, and registering with FINTRAC.  The amendments include beneficial ownership identification requirements for widely held or publicly traded trusts.  KYC and CDD are core regulatory requirements.  Reporting entities must take steps to confirm the accuracy of new beneficial ownership information as it is updated over time.  The PCMLTFA requires banks and credit unions; life insurance companies, brokers, and agents; \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  71  securities dealers; casinos; real estate brokers and agents; agents of the Crown (certain government agencies); MSBs; accountants and accountancy firms; precious metals and stones dealers; and British Columbia notaries to file STRs.    The PCMLTFA requires reporting entities to determine whether a client is a foreign PEP, a domestic PEP, a head of an international organization, or an associate or family member of any such person.  The PCMLTFA requires parliamentary committee review of the administration and implementation of the law every five years, with the last parliamentary review in 2018.  The government last published a national money laundering/terrorist financing risk assessment in July 2015 and expects to publish its next assessment in 2021. Canada actively participates in AML cooperation with the United States and other governments through mechanisms such as the North American Drug Dialogue.   Canada is a member of the FATF and the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/MER-Canada-2016.pdf.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The 2020 National Criminal Intelligence Estimate on money laundering and fraud notes law enforcement would benefit from additional training and resources to develop AML capacity.  It also estimates that hundreds of millions of dollars flow through Canada via TBML, identifying unrelated, third-party trade payments from countries with a high prevalence of money laundering as significant risks for TBML by Canadian professional money launderers.      Information sharing constraints constitute an AML deficiency for Canada.  The Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA) hinders information sharing among financial institutions, law enforcement, and FINTRAC, as banks and other reporting entities can be subject to large monetary fines for unauthorized data sharing resulting from AML cooperation.  FINTRAC is establishing PPPs with large financial institutions to address this deficiency and credits the PPP model with significantly increasing STR submissions.   AML regulation of attorneys was overturned by the Canadian supreme court in 2015 as an unconstitutional breach of attorney-client privilege.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The Canadian government has taken steps to improve its AML prosecutorial capacity and information sharing among law enforcement agencies.  Canada allocated $12 million, spread over five years starting in 2020, to establish a forensic accountant team to support federal, provincial, and municipal law enforcement money laundering and terrorist financing investigations.  The government also created the Financial Crimes Coordination Centre to coordinate intelligence and law enforcement agencies’ efforts to address money laundering and financial crime threats, and the Trade Fraud and Trade-Based Money Laundering Centre of Expertise to foster capacity related to TBML at the Canada Border Services Agency and FINTRAC.  The additional funding and increase in dedicated personnel and resources at the \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  72  federal, provincial, and municipal levels should prove beneficial to Canada’s AML efforts, but may require an adjustment period to maximize the reach and effectiveness of Canada’s AML initiatives.   Cayman Islands   OVERVIEW  The Cayman Islands, a UK overseas territory, is a major international financial center.  It is the seventh largest foreign holder of U.S. Treasury securities, the 14th largest holder of international assets, and 13th largest holder of liabilities.  As of September 2020, the Cayman Islands had 123 banks; 147 trust company licenses; 145 licenses for company management and corporate service providers; 775 insurance-related licenses; and five MSBs.  There are 109,986 companies incorporated or registered in the Cayman Islands.  There are 10,709 licensed/registered mutual funds and 12,331 registered private funds in the Cayman Islands.  The Cayman Islands has an established AML/CFT/counter-proliferation financing regime.  The government is committed to strengthening its AML/CFT framework.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  The Cayman Islands has an indirect tax regime.  According to a 2015 NRA of the jurisdiction, the main threats related to money laundering are fraud, tax evasion, and drug trafficking.  The Cayman Islands’ network of tax information exchange mechanisms extends to over 120 treaty partners.  The Cayman Islands has over 100 potential exchange partners for common reporting standard information.  Gaming is illegal.  The government does not permit registration of offshore gaming entities.  Procedures exist to guard against cross-border bulk cash smuggling.   Cayman Enterprise City, a special economic zone, was established in 2011 for knowledge-based industries.  Of 53 businesses in the commodities & derivatives park as of September 2019, 16 were registered with the Cayman Islands Monetary Authority (CIMA) under the Securities and Investment Law.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Shell banks, anonymous accounts, and the use of bearer shares are prohibited.  Tax evasion is codified as a predicate offense in the penal code and the Terrorism (Amendment) Law defines terrorist financing as a predicate offense for money laundering.    In June 2019, the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Law brought virtual service providers and single-family offices under AML/CFT regulations.  The Virtual Asset (Service Providers) Law, appointing the CIMA as AML/CFT supervisor of virtual asset service providers, took effect on October 31, 2020.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  73  The Securities Investment Business Law was amended in June 2019 and took effect in January 2020.  The amendment replaced the category of “excluded persons” with “registered persons,” with such persons now subject to AML/CFT oversight by CIMA.  CDD and STR requirements cover banks, trust companies, investment funds, fund administrators, securities and investment businesses, insurance companies and managers, MSBs, lawyers, accountants, corporate and trust or company service providers (TCSPs), money transmitters, dealers of precious metals and stones, the real estate industry, virtual asset service providers, and single-family offices.  The Proceeds of Crime Law (2020 Revision) adds building societies, cooperatives, and mutual funds and their administrators as covered entities subject to CDD and STR requirements.   In October 2019, the names of company directors became publicly available.  Since October 2020, the names of subscribers, registered office, year-end share capital, and nature of business of companies are publicly available.  A new administrative fines regime has been created for companies and TCSPs that fail to comply with monthly requirements to file beneficial ownership information with the Registrar of Companies.    The United States and the United Kingdom have an MLAT concerning the Cayman Islands.    The Cayman Islands is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer-fsrb/CFATF-Cayman-Islands-Mutual-Evaluation.pdf.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  Areas noted for improvement in the Cayman Islands include strengthening AML/CFT effectiveness by improving the availability and accuracy of information, interagency coordination and cooperation, international cooperation, and monitoring and enforcement.  A ministerial sub-committee of cabinet, chaired by the premier, oversees steps to address AML deficiencies.  The Financial Crime Focus Group, headed by the director of public prosecutions (DPP), will enhance the use of financial intelligence in the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes.  A supervisors’ forum and a proliferation financing interagency group have also been established.  The Cayman Islands strengthened international cooperation by increasing training and resources at the DPP, the Bureau of Financial Investigations (CIBFI), and the Financial Reporting Authority.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The UK is constitutionally responsible for the Cayman Islands’ international relations.  The UK arranged for the 1988 UN Drug Convention and the UNTOC to be extended to the Cayman Islands in 1995 and 2012, respectively.  The UNCAC was extended to the Cayman Islands by the UK on December 14, 2020.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  74  Supervisors have increased the number of onsite inspections, in line with the sectoral risk AML/CFT assessments.  Administrative fines for noncompliance with the AML/CFT regulations have been imposed.   As of October 2020, CIBFI and its predecessor, an interim task force, had commenced 50 money laundering investigations, in line with the risk profile of the jurisdiction.    The AML regulations require trust and company service providers to collect and maintain beneficial ownership information.  The Registrar of Companies stores this information in a centralized platform, which facilitates instantaneous access for law enforcement and competent authorities.  The government, in line with the EU 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive and the UK’s introduction of a public beneficial ownership register, committed to the introduction of a publicly accessible register of company beneficial ownership.   China, People’s Republic of  OVERVIEW  The People’s Republic of China (PRC) is a global hub for money laundering.  Enforcement capabilities have not kept pace with the sophistication and reach of criminal networks.  PRC authorities continue to identify new money laundering methods, including use of virtual currency.  However, PRC authorities rarely share this type of information nor take sufficient action to interdict or counter these methods.    In 2020, the PRC increased regulatory scrutiny of the financial sector and made improvements to its AML framework.  Yet serious shortcomings persist in effective implementation and ensuring transparency, particularly in the context of international cooperation.  The PRC should broaden its investigation and prosecution of money launderers and cooperate with international law enforcement investigations regarding domestic Chinese underground financial systems, virtual currencies, shell companies, and TBML.  The PRC is currently piloting a central bank-backed digital currency known as the eCNY or eCNY Digital Currency Electronic Payment.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Corruption is a major factor in money laundering.  Corruption, illegal drug production and trafficking, human trafficking, smuggling, intellectual property theft, crimes against property, tax evasion, and illicit financial activity linked to North Korea are the primary sources of laundered funds.  Criminal proceeds are generally laundered via bulk cash smuggling, TBML, shell companies, high-value asset purchases, investments, gaming, and by exploiting formal, informal, and third-party payment systems.    China has special economic zones (SEZs), 14 coastal “open cities” with characteristics of SEZs, and other national, provincial, and locally designated development zones.  Additionally, China has 21 FTZs, including three opened in 2020.  China’s greater economy is linked closely to Hong \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  75  Kong, a global financial center vulnerable as a transit point for foreign illicit proceeds, particularly from mainland China.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  China has KYC and STR requirements and EDD procedures for foreign, but not domestic, PEPs.  People’s Bank of China’s (PBOC) proceeds from money laundering fines and penalties in the first six months of 2020 exceed the total proceeds for 2019.  The increase in proceeds from fines is the result of a revision in penalty application from one inclusive fine, regardless of how many laws a financial institution broke, to multiple penalties for multiple violations.  In January 2020, the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission (CBIRC), issued procedures to incorporate AML/CFT into the scope of the CBIRC’s daily supervision and onsite inspections of banks and insurers.  Covered entities are directed to increase AML/CFT resources, strengthen employee training, and increase reporting capabilities.  In October 2020, the PBOC Operations Office (Beijing) released draft measures for comment that would set more detailed and stricter requirements concerning KYC, record keeping, CTRs, and STRs for real estate developers and intermediaries in Beijing.  In November 2020, PBOC and CBIRC jointly issued a for-comment draft with the same requirements for microcredit companies that operate online microlending businesses.   The United States and China are parties to the Agreement on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters.  U.S. law enforcement agencies note China has not cooperated sufficiently on financial investigations and does not provide adequate responses to requests for financial investigation information.  Furthermore, China’s inability to enforce U.S. court orders or judgments obtained as a result of non-conviction-based forfeiture actions against China-based assets remains a significant barrier to enhanced U.S.-China cooperation on these cases.  China is a member of the FATF and two FATF-style regional bodies, the APG and the EAG.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/MER-China-2019.pdf.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The absence of coverage of domestic PEPs is particularly important as corruption is a major source of laundered funds and state-owned enterprises play a dominant role in the economy.   DNFBPs are not supervised.  China does not have detailed CDD requirements specific to DNFBPs, and STR reporting is virtually non-existent.  The PBOC’s lack of understanding and scrutiny of DNFBP-related risk is particularly concerning given the rapid growth in China’s real estate and precious metals sectors.    The government should address the rights of bona fide third parties and the availability of substitute assets in seizure/confiscation actions.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  76  China’s FIU is not a member of the Egmont Group and often lacks capacity or political will to effectively share financial intelligence.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Money laundering investigations are not a priority and often do not supplement investigations of predicate offenses.  The PRC largely ignores money launderers if they did not actively participate in predicate criminal behavior.  As a result, each year the PRC convicts only a few dozen individuals of money laundering.  China should broaden its focus to go beyond active participants in the predicate crime.  The PBOC, the Ministry of Public Security, and provincial law enforcement share responsibility for countering and investigating money laundering.  The PRC should continue efforts to better understand the transparent use of AML tools to support a wide range of investigations and prosecutions.  China should seek to enhance coordination among its financial regulators and law enforcement bodies and with international partners.   The PRC should address legislative and structural shortcomings relating to the coverage of domestic PEPs, DNFBPs, and STR criteria.    Colombia  OVERVIEW  Colombia has one of Latin America’s more comprehensive money laundering detection programs, yet laundering of illicit proceeds from drug trafficking, illegal gold trading, extortion, and public corruption is prevalent throughout its economy.   Administrative monitoring and sanctions have had some success against money laundering, but Colombia can improve results in judicial processes by developing both broader awareness and areas of specialization in AML among monitoring, law enforcement, and criminal justice actors.  The overburdened court system and public corruption create additional obstacles to an effective AML regime.  Colombia should more aggressively target TBML, a significant source of financing for drug trafficking and criminal organizations.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The Colombian government reports that illicit proceeds are most commonly laundered through bulk cash smuggling and TBML.  TBML criminal activities include invoice-related fraud used to transfer value, and counterfeit and contraband goods that enter through shipping ports or are smuggled across land borders.  According to Colombian officials, corrupt customs authorities facilitate evasion of the customs process. Criminal organizations use formal and informal financial schemes to launder their ill-gotten gains, including money brokers, real estate investments, wire transfers, and remittances.  Illegal gold mining and trading is another money laundering scheme that generates high profits.  The \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  77  lack of state presence and government oversight in rural mining areas is an additional obstacle to gold traceability.  Colombia reports that virtual assets play a minor role in money laundering.  The more than 100 FTZs in Colombia are generally well-regulated for AML purposes.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS Colombia has CDD and STR regulations; however, it has not been successful in passing legislation on virtual assets.  Colombia’s central bank leads a permanent virtual asset working group tasked with creating the regulatory measures and technical support for virtual asset oversight for all affected industry sectors.  In 2020, the Superintendent of Finance (the Colombian financial sector oversight agency) updated the National Anti-Money Laundering Counter Terrorist Financing Risk Management System (known as Sarlaft 4.0) that other Colombian regulators use as a guide to AML compliance monitoring.   According to the Colombian legal framework, the Financial Intelligence and Analysis Unit (UIAF), Colombia’s FIU, is the national AML/CFT coordinator.  To comply with international standards, in 2020, the UIAF published the NRA completed in 2019.   Colombia is part of 16 multilateral treaties and 10 bilateral treaties on international judicial cooperation, including information exchange matters.  In addition, Act 526/1999 allows the UIAF to participate in necessary international AML/CFT/proliferation information exchange instruments outside of the Egmont Group process.  Colombia is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/a-c/colombia/documents/mutualevaluationofcolombia.html   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Colombia has a comprehensive AML/CFT regulatory framework but needs to improve regulations on proliferation.  Colombia’s financial sector regulation is robust, but its oversight of other sectors and implementation of its laws and regulations is inconsistent, and there is limited information sharing among key AML institutions.   DNFBPs generally have a lower level of awareness than the financial sector regarding AML/CFT regulations.  Regulators of DNFBPs are relatively under-resourced compared to the financial sector, posing a challenge to effectively monitor AML/CTF compliance.    EDD for foreign PEPs is only partially addressed, with some covered entities only required to apply EDD for domestic PEPs.  There are also significant deficiencies in the CDD framework and its implementation.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  78  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Colombian and U.S. authorities cooperate closely on money laundering and non-conviction-based asset forfeiture investigations.  Cooperation within and between Colombian AML agencies continues to be insufficient.  Law enforcement agencies and prosecutors need more resources and specialized training to effectively investigate and prosecute complex financial crimes.    Most goods brought into Colombia via TBML are sold in black-market venues, most frequently San Andresitos, popular informal shopping areas and thus resistant to effective supervision and enforcement.  Criminal organizations use adaptive financial networks, relying on corruption, bribery, and professional money launderers, to circumvent Colombia’s AML supervision and enforcement nets.    The Colombian Special Assets Entity, responsible for managing and disposing of forfeited assets, has struggled to manage its large inventory.  Colombia has only 12 asset forfeiture judges and one asset forfeiture appellate court, so some asset forfeiture cases take up to 30 years to be resolved.   President Duque’s administration has committed to improving and strengthening the country’s AML, CFT, and counter-proliferation structures through capacity-building initiatives and legislative proposals.   Costa Rica   OVERVIEW  Organized crime and narcotics trafficking generate the majority of the financial crimes in Costa Rica and present significant challenges for authorities.  The country continues to show improvement in its AML supervision framework.  The country’s new state party status in the OECD presents opportunities for progress.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Narcotics trafficking continues to grow as a principal source of laundered assets in Costa Rica, with cocaine seizures through October 2020 exceeding 40 metric tons--a new record.  While the construction, real estate, and hotel sectors are areas of concern, campaign financing is also a money laundering vulnerability.  Environmental crimes including illegal mining, wildlife trafficking, and illegal logging also occur.  Authorities have identified sophisticated financing and laundering schemes associated with these crimes and note that illicit revenue from environmental crimes exceeds that of drug trafficking.  Costa Rica is not a regional financial hub; however, significant tourist and migrant flows contribute to the vulnerability of Costa Rica’s airports and border crossings as sites for bulk cash smuggling and related typologies.  Online gaming and sportsbook enterprises, legal in Costa Rica, continue to be areas of concern.  While financial institutions remain vulnerable to money \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  79  laundering, their exposure has lessened with the gradual implementation of monitoring requirements.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Executive and legislative branch officials have demonstrated commitment and political will to align Costa Rica’s legal framework with international standards.  Costa Rica is party to several inter-American agreements on criminal matters and UN conventions.  Costa Rica has CDD and STR requirements, and a fiscal fraud law (Law 9416) that provides for disclosure of beneficial owners.  In June 2019, Costa Rica’s legislature approved a corporate criminal liability law (Law 9699) for offenses related to bribery and corruption, thus remedying a longstanding deficiency in Costa Rica’s AML framework.  Additionally, Costa Rica’s reporting and supervision requirements cover traditional financial institutions as well as DNFBPs.  Costa Rica is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available here:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/#Costa%20Rica.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Costa Rica does not have stand-alone asset forfeiture legislation and continues to use organized crime and anti-narcotics laws to seize illicit assets.  Since September 2019, Costa Rica has used its existing legislation to obtain 19 judgments, thereby forfeiting $867,067.  Furthermore, Costa Rica does not have an adequate legal framework for non-conviction-based asset forfeiture nor provisions for asset sharing.   Costa Rica does not regulate virtual currencies, and increased popularity of cryptocurrencies presents an additional enforcement challenge for local authorities.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Fiscal austerity measures continue to present risks.  A Special Jurisdiction for Organized Crime, intended to function by October 2020, was postponed because of budget restrictions.  As a state party to the OECD, Costa Rica committed itself to new regimens of AML protocols.  International experts recommended Costa Rica update its assessment of its exposure to corruption-related money laundering and take appropriate measures to address those risks.  They also recommend providing further guidance to reporting entities on identifying suspicious transactions indicative of money laundering predicated on foreign bribery, including typologies that specifically address foreign bribery.    Professional staffing levels at Costa Rica’s Special Prosecutor’s Office for Money Laundering have increased in the past year, and there are currently 130 active cases.  There have been four convictions from September 2019 to date.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  80  In the first six months of 2020, 230 STRs were filed in Costa Rica, resulting in 79 requests for cooperation with national and/or international authorities.  The supervision platform for DNFBPs has reached 260,150 registered entities, up from approximately 3,500 in late 2019.   Costa Rica’s desire to comply with OECD accession requirements and international AML standards has generated a conducive environment for substantive changes to the AML framework.  Costa Rica’s OECD membership will undoubtedly continue to accelerate these advances.  Cuba   OVERVIEW  Cuba is not a regional financial center.  Cuban financial practices and U.S. sanctions continue to prevent Cuba’s banking system from fully integrating into the international financial system.  The government-controlled banking sector renders Cuba an unattractive location for large-scale, third-party money laundering through financial institutions.  The centrally-planned economy allows for little, and extremely regulated, private activity.  However, a significant black market operates parallel to the heavily subsidized and rationed formal market dominated by the state and which state authorities actively participate in and benefit from.  The Cuban government does not identify money laundering as a major problem.  The Cuban government and state-controlled businesses actively engage in international money laundering in order to evade U.S. sanctions.  Cuba should strengthen the transparency of its financial sector by engaging regional and international AML/CFT communities and increase criminal investigations and prosecutions.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Although it is largely disconnected from the international financial system, there are some factors and conditions in Cuba that are conducive to money laundering and make Cuba a potential destination for illicit funds.  These include a poorly regulated and opaque banking sector, Cuba’s cash-based economy, the Cuban government’s desperation for hard currency, ubiquitous government corruption and overall lack of transparency, and connections to high profile current and former government leaders of countries in the region accused of corruption.  Cuba’s geographic location places it between drug-supplying and drug-consuming countries.  Cuba has little foreign investment compared to similar nations in the Caribbean, a small international business presence, and no known offshore casinos or internet gaming sites.  There are no known issues with or abuse of NPOs, ARS, offshore sectors, FTZs, bearer shares, or other specific sectors or situations.  Cuba’s first special economic development zone at the port of Mariel in northwestern Cuba was established in November 2013 and is still under development.  It is potentially located on expropriated property, built by the government in partnership with Brazilian engineering firm Odebrecht, subject of numerous corruption investigations throughout Latin America.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  81  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Cuba claims to take into account international AML/CFT standards.  Legislation released in 2013 outlines regulations regarding enhanced CDD for foreign PEPs, although it continues to exempt domestic PEPs from the reach of the legislation.   The FIU shares financial intelligence with the Revolutionary National Police, the Attorney General's Office, and General Comptroller of the Republic.  In addition to its core FIU functions, the FIU can suspend transactions and freeze funds, both domestically and upon request from a foreign counterpart.   The United States and Cuba have very limited engagement in law enforcement matters.  Cuba has bilateral agreements with a number of countries related to combating drug trafficking.   Cuba is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/a-c/cuba/documents/mer-cuba-2015.html.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Cuba has a number of strategic deficiencies in its AML regime.  These include a lack of SAR reporting to its FIU by financial institutions and DNFBPs, and weak supervision and enforcement within its DNFBP and NPO sectors.  These deficiencies stem from Cuba’s opaque national banking system, which hampers efforts to monitor the effectiveness and progress of Cuba’s AML efforts.   The U.S. government issued the Cuban Assets Control Regulations in 1963, under the Trading with the Enemy Act.  The embargo remains in place and restricts travel and most investment and prohibits the import of most products of Cuban origin.  With some notable exceptions, including agricultural products, medicines and medical devices, telecommunications equipment, and consumer communications devices, most exports from the United States to Cuba require a license.   Additionally, a number of U.S.-based assets of the Cuban government or Cuban nationals are frozen.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  In April 2019, the Cuban government convicted Cuban-American Orelvis Olivera in absentia and sentenced him to 10 years in prison for money laundering, tax evasion, forgery of public documents, and illicit enrichment, among other crimes.  The conviction was based on his convictions in the United States and his investments in Cuba, which the Cuban government proceeded to confiscate.   Major international banks have participated in transferring funds involving Cuba in apparent violation of U.S. sanctions.  In April 2019, British bank Standard Chartered agreed to pay $1.1 billion to settle allegations by the authorities in the United States and Britain that it violated \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  82  money laundering laws and economic sanctions, including those involving Cuba.  This follows a $1.34 billion settlement French bank Société Générale agreed to in November 2018 that also implicated U.S. sanctions on Cuba.  Cuba should increase the transparency of its financial sector and increase its engagement with the regional and international AML communities.  Cuba should ensure its CDD measures and SAR requirements include domestic PEPs, all DNFBPs, and the NPO sector, and create appropriate laws and procedures to enhance international cooperation and mutual legal assistance.  Cuba should increase the transparency of criminal investigations and prosecutions.   Curacao   OVERVIEW   Curaçao’s prominent position as a regional financial center is declining, but it is still considered a transshipment point for drugs and gold from South America.  Money laundering occurs through the use of straw/money mules, private foundations, cash intensive businesses as front companies, purchase of luxury goods, real estate, unlicensed money lenders and remitters (underground banking), wire transfers, and TBML.  Transfers of gold from South America remain problematic.   Curaçao is a semi-autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Kingdom).  The Kingdom retains responsibility for foreign policy and defense, including signing international conventions, with the approval of the local parliament.  The law enforcement MOU between the four Kingdom countries and the United States includes Curaçao.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Criminal organizations may try to take advantage of the availability of U.S. dollars, offshore banking and incorporation systems, two FTZs, a large shipping container terminal, Curaçao-based online gaming sites, and resorts/casinos to place, layer, and integrate illegal proceeds.  Money laundering occurs through real estate purchases, international tax shelters, gold transactions, and through wire transfers and cash transport within the Kingdom.  Given its proximity and economic ties to Venezuela, the risk of Curaçao being used to launder the proceeds of crimes emanating from Venezuela is substantial.  Curaçao’s offshore tax regime ended in 2019.  Since 2002, no new offshore companies can incorporate and obtain an offshore tax status.  Existing offshore companies had until 2019 to operate under the existing offshore regime.  After this, the companies will in theory be subject to Curaçao’s onshore effective tax rate of 22 percent, but alternate tax regimes remain, depending on company activities.   Curaçao’s FTZ is supervised by Curaçao’s state-owned (85 percent) Curinde N.V. Corporation and overseen by the Minister of Economic Development.  There are 35 banks currently operating in Curaçao, down from 52 in 2019. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  83  Curaçao is perceived to be one of the largest jurisdictions licensing online gaming.  In 2019, supervision of this sector was transferred to a gaming control board.  The Curaçao Gaming Control Board is the AML/CFT supervisor for the entire gaming industry.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   The Kingdom may extend the applicability of international conventions to the semi-autonomous entities in the Kingdom.  The Kingdom extended to Curaçao the 1988 UN Drug Convention and the UNTOC (as a successor to the Netherland Antilles).  With the Kingdom’s agreement, each semi-autonomous entity can be assigned a status of its own within international or regional organizations, subject to the organization’s agreement.  The individual countries may conclude MOUs in areas in which they have autonomy if they do not infringe on the foreign policy of the Kingdom.   The financial sector is supervised by the Central Bank of Curaçao and consists of credit institutions, money transfer companies, insurance companies, insurance intermediaries, trust and company service providers, administrators of investment institutions and self-administered investment institutions, securities intermediaries, asset management companies, securities exchange, and pension funds.  Service providers that are subject to the AML regime (National Ordinance on Reporting of Unusual Transactions (NORUT)) are required to comply with KYC requirements and file unusual transaction reports (UTRs) with the FIU.  Curaçao is a member of the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.   Curaçao banned the trade in Venezuelan gold in 2019 via national decree.   The 1981 MLAT between the Kingdom and the United States applies to Curaçao and is regularly used by U.S. and Curaçao law enforcement agencies for international drug trafficking and money laundering investigations.  The 2004 United States-Netherlands Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement, incorporating specific U.S.-EU provisions, was not extended to Curaçao.  Additionally, Curaçao has a tax information exchange agreement with the United States.   The Kingdom also extended to Curaçao the Agreement Regarding Mutual Cooperation in the Tracing, Freezing, Seizure, and Forfeiture of the Proceeds and Instrumentalities of Crime and the Sharing of Forfeited Assets, which was signed by the United States and the Kingdom in 1992.   Curaçao is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/documents/mutual-evaluation-reports/curazao/640-curaçao-mer-final?highlight=WyJjdXJhXHUwMGU3YW8iXQ.     AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES    Curaçao has yet to complete a national money laundering risk assessment.  The results are expected in 2021.    The Kingdom has not extended the UNCAC to Curaçao.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  84  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Curaçao utilizes UTRs, a broader reporting mechanism than an STR scheme.  Pursuant to the local NORUT, the reporting entities file UTRs with the FIU.  The FIU analyzes the UTRs and determines whether they should be classified as suspicious and disclosed to the law enforcement and prosecutors.  Annually, the FIU receives approximately 50,000 UTRs and disseminates roughly 900 to 5,000 to the authorities.  Because of the perceived growth in UTRs and in view of limited resources, the FIU will launch a new reporting portal in January 2021 to automate processes even more, as well as a new analysis system.    Curaçao recently conducted several high-profile money laundering investigations, and numerous former officials were investigated, charged, or convicted.  There are two multi-year money laundering prosecutions ongoing in Curaçao.   Cyprus  OVERVIEW   The Republic of Cyprus (ROC) is the only internationally recognized government on the island, but, since 1974, the northern part of Cyprus has been administered by Turkish Cypriots.  The north proclaimed itself the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus” (“TRNC”) in 1983, but the United States does not recognize the “TRNC,” nor does any country other than Turkey.  A buffer zone patrolled by the UN peacekeeping force in Cyprus separates the two sides.  The ROC and the area administered by Turkish Cypriots are discussed separately below.  THE REPUBLIC OF CYPRUS   The ROC continues to upgrade its established AML legal framework.  As a regional financial and corporate services center, Cyprus has a significant number of nonresident businesses.  Although increased enforcement of registration rules caused the total number of companies to decline from 272,157 in 2013 to 216,239 at the end of 2018, it rose to 223,282 at the end of 2019.  The long-term downward trend indicates an overall shrinkage of the international business sector.  By law, all companies registered in the ROC must disclose their ultimate beneficial owners to authorities.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The ROC financial system is vulnerable to money laundering by domestic and foreign criminals; proceeds generated by illicit activity abroad pose a greater threat.  The primary sources of illicit proceeds are investment fraud, corruption, advance fee fraud, tax evasion, illegal drugs, and tobacco smuggling.  Additionally, cybercrime, especially phishing, e-mail hacking, and ransomware use, continues to increase.  Criminals have reportedly used ROC banks to launder proceeds, particularly from Russian and Ukrainian illicit activity.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  85  In 2017, the government awarded a multi-year, exclusive casino license to Hong Kong-based Melco International.  Melco is building an integrated casino resort expected to open in 2022.  Until then, Melco is authorized to operate a temporary casino in Limassol and up to four “satellite” casinos throughout the country.  ROC authorities are developing their capacity to supervise land-based casino activity (online casino gaming remains unlawful).  There is minimal expertise in gaming supervision, leaving the gaming sector vulnerable to abuse.  The Cyprus Gaming and Casino Supervision Commission is working with international gaming consultants to conduct due diligence on license applicants, train staff, and establish mechanisms to identify and report illicit activity.  Sports betting (offline and online) is supervised by the National Betting Authority.    Another emerging concern is the rise of virtual banking and use of virtual currency.  The ROC is currently conducting a national AML/CFT risk assessment on virtual assets, with the assistance of international consultants, with a view to mitigating relevant risks.    The ROC’s now defunct citizenship by investment (CBI) program allowed foreign investors to apply for ROC (and thus EU) citizenship after investing in ROC business, infrastructure, development, or a personal residence, subject to several conditions.  This program generated an estimated $8 billion in investment from 2013 to 2020.  Program eligibility requirements were not particularly stringent prior to 2018, and enforcement after 2018 was lax, raising serious concerns about the extent to which the program was used to evade law enforcement authorities or facilitate illicit financial flows.  Following an extensive and damning media expose on CBI program corruption, the ROC abolished it, effective November 1, 2020.  As of November 2020, there were 691 pending primary applications, with 722 eligible family members.  Authorities refuse to release the names of CBI beneficiaries or applicants, citing privacy concerns, but the government has launched inquiries into whether any prior beneficiaries should have their citizenships revoked.  On October 7, 2020, the ROC government announced the council of ministers decided to initiate revocation of ROC citizenship for seven individuals and their 12 dependents naturalized through the CBI program.  Skeptics doubt the likely efficacy of the inquiries, citing the lack of transparency and prior corruption in the program.  Moreover, legal authorities for revocation are not clear.  On October 20, 2020, the EC announced it is launching infringement proceedings against Cyprus regarding its CBI scheme, warning such schemes violate EU law, in part because they do not require a sufficiently meaningful attachment to the country granting citizenship.  These proceedings continue even though the CBI program was terminated.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   The AML/CFT law contains provisions allowing the registration and enforcement of foreign court orders, including foreign non-conviction-based confiscation orders.  ROC authorities maintain close cooperation with foreign authorities, including U.S. agencies.  ROC legislation covers both foreign and domestic PEPs.   There is a bilateral MLAT between the United States and Cyprus.   The ROC is a member of MONEYVAL, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.coe.int/en/web/moneyval/jurisdictions/cyprus.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  86  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The ROC continues to upgrade its AML/CFT legal framework.  The 2018 NRA characterizes the Cypriot banking sector as high risk, and trust and company service providers, lawyers, and accounting firms as medium/high risk.  It identifies numerous areas for improvement, including more effective implementation of AML laws and regulations, enhanced awareness and capacity building in all sectors, and specialized training for prosecutors, investigators, and the judiciary.  The ROC endorsed a national AML strategy and a detailed action plan to address issues identified in the NRA.   On October 30, 2020, the EC sent the ROC a “reasoned opinion” over its failure to transpose the 5th Anti-Money Laundering Directive into domestic law.  The ministry of finance is working with the legislature to try to pass appropriate legislation in 2021.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   The Unit for Combating Money Laundering is the ROC’s FIU.  The ROC has several supervisory authorities for AML compliance, all of which can issue directives to their respective supervised entities and have developed onsite and offsite tools for risk-based supervision.   Supervision of the banking sector, including fit and proper checks, still needs to be strengthened.  The legally binding February 2019 Central Bank of Cyprus (CBC) Directive to Credit Institutions built on previous circulars to further tighten requirements to establish or maintain business relationships with shell companies.   The government aims to have a national registry listing all beneficial owners of legal entities in the ROC operational in mid-2021.   To “name and shame” offenders, and following specific legal provisions, both the CBC and the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission post information on their websites on the imposition of fines.     In 2018, the most recent data available, Cypriot authorities convicted 26 persons for money laundering offenses.     AREA ADMINISTERED BY TURKISH CYPRIOTS   OVERVIEW   The area administered by Turkish Cypriots lacks the necessary AML/CFT legal and institutional framework.  Turkish Cypriot authorities have taken steps to address some major deficiencies, although “laws” are not sufficiently enforced to effectively prevent money laundering.  The casino and offshore banking sectors are of significant concern.  Because the “TRNC” is not recognized by any country other than Turkey, the banking sector is largely isolated from international financial institutions.  Turkish Cypriot banks operating in the area do not have access to the global interbank messaging system and have almost no correspondent banking \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  87  relationships outside of Turkey.  Almost no international central bank will conduct business with the “TRNC central bank.”  This isolation somewhat mitigates the money laundering risk, as moving illicit funds out of the “TRNC” is difficult unless one works through a local branch of a Turkish bank.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   As of November 2020, there are 33 casinos in the Turkish Cypriot-administered area.  The ongoing shortage of law enforcement resources and expertise leaves the casino and gaming/entertainment sector poorly regulated and vulnerable to money laundering.  Unregulated moneylenders and currency exchange houses are also of concern.   Additionally, the offshore banking sector poses a money laundering risk.  As of October 2020, it consists of six offshore banks regulated by the “central bank.”  Turkish Cypriots only permit banks licensed by OECD-member countries to operate an offshore branch locally.   In the area administered by Turkish Cypriots, there is one free port and zone in Famagusta, regulated by the “Free-Ports and Free Zones Law.”  Permitted operations and activities include industry, manufacturing, and production; storage and export of goods; assembly and repair of goods; building, repair, and assembly of ships; and banking and insurance services.  There have been reports of smuggling of people, illegal drugs, tobacco, alcohol, and foodstuffs across the UN buffer zone and with Turkish smugglers in the waters off Famagusta.  Additionally, intellectual property rights violations are common; a legislative framework is lacking, and pirated materials, such as sunglasses, clothing, shoes, and DVDs/CDs, are freely available for sale.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Turkish Cypriot authorities passed AML “legislation” in 2008.  Draft AML “legislation” incorporating elements of international standards has been pending in “parliament” since 2014.   Financial institutions and DNFBPs are required to submit STRs to the “FIU.”  Following receipt, the “FIU” forwards STRs to the “Anti-Money Laundering Committee,” which decides whether to refer suspicious cases to the “Attorney General’s Office,” and then, if necessary, to the “police” for further investigation.   The area administered by Turkish Cypriots does not have a records-exchange mechanism with the United States.  It is not a member of any FATF-style regional body and is not subject to AML peer evaluation.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The area administered by Turkish Cypriots lacks an adequate AML/CFT legal and institutional framework.  Inadequate legislation and a lack of expertise among members of the enforcement, regulatory, and financial communities restrict regulatory capabilities.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  88  The area does have in place “regulations” requiring EDD for both foreign and domestic PEPs, but compliance is lacking.   According to local experts, the “criminal code” needs to be updated to aid money laundering-related prosecutions.   The “FIU” of the area administered by Turkish Cypriots is not a member of the Egmont Group.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   While progress has been made in recent years with the passage of “laws” better regulating the onshore and offshore banking sectors and casinos, these “statutes” are not sufficiently enforced.   The “central bank” oversees and regulates all banks.  In addition to the “central bank” and the “development bank,” there are 21 banks in the area administered by Turkish Cypriots, of which 16 are Turkish Cypriot-owned banks, and five are branches of Turkish banks.  Two of the five members of the “central bank’s” “board of directors” are from Turkey, as is the “central bank governor.”  Turkish Cypriot banks rely on their correspondent banking relationships for foreign currency transactions.  Between January and October 2020, the “FIU” reported receiving 1,020 STRs, compared to 941 for the same period in 2019, and participated in 28 money laundering-related criminal investigations.   The EU provides technical assistance to the Turkish Cypriots to combat money laundering because of the area’s money laundering and terrorist financing risks.   Dominica   OVERVIEW  Despite its challenging geography and resource constraints, the Commonwealth of Dominica made progress with its AML regime in 2020.  The island’s rugged bays and inlets and close proximity to the French territories of Martinique and Guadeloupe result in drugs, cash, and smuggled goods illegally entering the country by sea.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The government indicates that narcotics and cybercrime are the major sources of illicit funds.  The country’s geographic location and porous borders raise risks for narcotics trafficking.  Additionally, foreign nationals from Europe, South America, and Asia have used automated teller machines in Dominica to skim money from European bank accounts by exploiting security deficiencies.      The preliminary vulnerabilities identified by the NRA are inadequate AML training for the \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  89  judiciary and prosecutorial authorities, lack of awareness of new AML/CFT procedures by key law enforcement agencies, and ineffective supervision of DNFBPs.  Dominica reports the offshore financial services sector is composed of 13 offshore banks, which are regulated and supervised by the Financial Service Unit (FSU).  There are seven MSBs, 10 credit unions, one development bank, one internet gaming company, and 16 insurance companies that provide general and long-term insurance in Dominica.  The FSU also regulates these entities.  There are an unknown number of trusts and IBCs.  (As of 2015, the number of IBCs was close to 19,000.)  Bearer shares are permitted, but beneficiaries of the bearer shares must be disclosed to financial institutions as part of their KYC programs.  The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank supervises the four commercial banks in Dominica.    Under Dominica’s citizenship by investment (CBI) program, individuals can obtain citizenship through payment to the government’s Economic Diversification Fund of $100,000 for an individual or $200,000 for a family of four, or through an investment in real estate valued at a minimum of $200,000.  The real estate option incurs fees ranging from $25,000 to $70,000 depending on family size.  Authorized agents, based both domestically and abroad, market the CBI program and are typically the first point of contact for applicants.  Dominica markets its program as “one of the fastest and most affordable” in the Caribbean.  An application for economic citizenship must be made through a government-approved local agent and requires a fee for due diligence or background check purposes.  There is no mandatory interview process; however, the government may require interviews in particular cases.  Applicants must make a source of funds declaration with supporting evidence.  The government’s Citizenship by Investment Unit (CBIU) manages the screening and application process.    Applicants from Iran, North Korea, and Sudan are eligible to apply if they have not lived in those countries for at least 10 years, have no substantial assets there, and do not engage in business in or with those countries.  Applicants from Iran, North Korea, Sudan, and Syria are required to undergo EDD checks with associated higher fees.  Dominica accepts a large number of applicants and sometimes issues passports despite adverse information uncovered during the vetting process.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  There have not been any major changes in Dominica’s extensive AML laws and regulations.  Relevant AML laws and regulations include the 2016 Money Laundering Prevention (Amendment) Act (MPLA), the 2013 Financial Services Unit (Amendment) Act, and the 2016 Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act.  A 2018 Magistrate’s Code of Procedure Act update specifies the forms and procedures used in the application for detention, forfeiture, and release of cash.  Dominica has an MLAT and an extradition treaty with the United States.  Agencies in Dominica share information with counterpart agencies through various means, including exchanges between FIUs, customs services, police agencies, and through the Asset Recovery Inter-Agency Network for the Caribbean.  The Code of Practice provides for the exchange of information by competent authorities. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  90   Dominica is a member of the CFATF, a FATF style regional body.  Dominica’s last MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/dominica-1.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Dominica has no major deficiencies in legislation.  Because Dominica has numerous pieces of amended legislation, a legislative review to identify any conflicts and determine which pieces of legislation could be consolidated into one MLPA would be beneficial.   ENFORCEMENT/ IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  A comprehensive legislative framework addresses international standards.  Dominica is in the process of implementing its money laundering/terrorist financing NRA with donor assistance and has identified several preliminary vulnerabilities within its AML/CFT regime, which are being addressed in the implementation action plan.  There has been effective collaboration among law enforcement agencies in intercepting criminal proceeds through coordinating and conducting joint operations.  In 2020, authorities seized $885,917 ($2,394,135 Eastern Caribbean dollars (XCD)).  There were two charges for money laundering in 2020.  These cases have a monetary value of $244,249 ($661,314 XCD).  These matters are pending at the magistrates court.   Dominican Republic   OVERVIEW  The Dominican Republic (DR) is a major transshipment point for illicit narcotics destined for the United States and Europe.  The eight international airports, 16 seaports, and a large porous frontier with Haiti present Dominican authorities with serious challenges.  The DR is not a major regional financial center, despite having one of the largest economies in the Caribbean.  Corruption within the government and the private sector, the presence of international illicit trafficking cartels, a large informal economy, and weak financial controls make the DR vulnerable to money laundering threats.  Financial institutions in the DR engage in currency transactions involving international narcotics trafficking proceeds that include significant amounts of U.S. currency or currency derived from illegal drug sales in the United States.  President Abinader assumed the presidency in August 2020 and has stated his commitment to strengthen AML actions, especially in narcotics trafficking and corruption cases.  Key law enforcement officials have publicly committed to this increased focus.  The government will need to address noted deficiencies to move the country closer to compliance with international standards.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  91  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The major sources of laundered proceeds stem from illicit trafficking activities, tax evasion, public corruption, and fraudulent financial activities, particularly transactions with forged credit cards.  U.S. law enforcement has identified networks smuggling weapons into the DR from the United States, and DR criminal organizations play a significant role in illicit drug distribution throughout the northeastern United States.  Bulk cash smuggling by couriers and the use of wire transfer remittances are the primary methods for moving illicit funds from the United States into the DR.  Once in the DR, currency exchange houses, money remittance companies, real estate and construction companies, and casinos facilitate the laundering of these illicit funds.  Car dealerships, the precious metals sector, and tourism agencies also contribute to money laundering activities in the DR.   As of the end of 2019, 695 companies, primarily engaged in manufacturing, were located in the DR’s 75 FTZs.  These companies are exempt from most national and municipal taxes, as long as the products they produce are exported to foreign markets.  The National Council of Export Free Trade Zones regulates compliance with Law 8-90, on FTZs, and is composed of representatives from the public and private sectors.  There are no known instances of money laundering activity in the FTZs.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Law against Asset Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism, Law 155-17, enacted in 2017, extends the functions of the FIU to act as the Technical Secretariat of the National Committee against Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing.  Law 155-17 also strengthens penalties and broadens the scope of crimes covered under the legislation, among other changes.  The DR has comprehensive KYC and STR regulations.  The United States and the DR do not have a bilateral MLAT but do use a similar process via multilateral law enforcement conventions to exchange data for judicial proceedings on a case-by-case basis.   The DR’s weak asset forfeiture regime is improving but does not cover confiscation of instrumentalities intended for use in the commission of money laundering offenses; property of corresponding value; and income, profits, or other benefits from the proceeds of crime.  The Congress of the Dominican Republic has been reviewing legislation pending since 2014.  The proposed legislation would institute non-conviction-based asset forfeiture and align the asset forfeiture regime with international standards.  The DR is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  The DR’s most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/#Dominican%20Republic.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  92  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  The DR has a mechanism (Law 155-17) for sharing and requesting information related to money laundering; this mechanism is now in force after the DR’s July 2019 readmission to the Egmont Group.    The DR has weaknesses regarding PEPs, has no legislation providing safe harbor protection for STR filers, and does not criminalize tipping off.  The government also needs to strengthen regulation of casinos and non-bank actors and is exploring methodologies to do so.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The DR continues to work on areas where it is non-compliant with international AML standards, and the national money laundering working group has publicly reaffirmed the government’s commitment to reaching compliance.  The Attorney General’s Office reported no convictions for money laundering in 2020, but 20 new cases entered the courts in 2020, adding to the 50 cases currently underway.  The government should take steps to rectify continuing weaknesses regarding PEPS, pass an effective non-conviction-based asset forfeiture law as well as legislation to provide safe harbor protection for STR filers and criminalize tipping off.  The government should better regulate casinos, non-bank businesses, professions, real estate companies, and betting and lottery parlors, and strengthen regulations for financial cooperatives and insurance companies.     Ecuador   OVERVIEW   Located between two major drug-producing countries, Ecuador is a major drug transit country.  A dollarized, cash-based economy and the lack of financial inclusion in key sectors contribute to Ecuador’s money laundering vulnerabilities.  Public corruption scandals with domestic and international linkages have involved money laundering.  Money laundering occurs primarily through trade, commercial activity, and cash couriers.  Bulk cash smuggling and structuring are also common.    Pursuing public corruption is a top priority for President Lenin Moreno’s government.  Authorities have investigated and successfully prosecuted high-level government officials, including former president Rafael Correa.  While Ecuador has strengthened its AML/CFT regime, the government needs to implement additional reforms.  Bureaucratic stove-piping; corruption; lack of specialized AML expertise in the judiciary, law enforcement, and banking regulatory agencies; and limited prosecutorial capacity hinder the government’s efforts to improve AML/CFT enforcement and prosecutions.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  93  Ecuadorian cooperation with U.S. law enforcement agencies improved due to increased technical assistance for the Financial and Economic Analysis Unit (UAFE), Ecuador’s FIU, and the formation of a vetted multi-agency AML unit.         VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES    Narcotrafficking is a significant source of illicit proceeds, and criminals continue to use commercial and trade mechanisms to launder funds.  Recently discovered, significant gold deposits incentivize illegal miners to operate outside the country’s nascent commercial mining industry.  Other illicit activities include the trafficking of drugs, arms, and people.  TBML, particularly cross-border activity, remains a threat.     A dollarized, cash-based economy with a significant informal sector also contributes to money laundering vulnerabilities.  According to the Central Bank of Ecuador (CBE), 61 percent of Ecuadorians have access to the financial system through accounts in banks and cooperatives.  Six percent of the 60,883 registered microenterprises have bank accounts.      KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Ecuador has STR requirements and EDD for PEPs.  Ecuador has a free, online registry of beneficial ownership.  The law requires registration of any entity holding a single share of any company or partnership.      President Moreno vetoed asset forfeiture reforms in 2019, saying they would violate an individual’s constitutional rights.  The National Assembly subsequently added embezzlement, extortion, bribery, influence peddling, trafficking in persons, and illicit association to the range of crimes subject to equivalent confiscation.      Ecuador and the United States cooperate under relevant multilateral conventions to ensure the sharing of records in connection with drug investigations and proceedings.    Ecuador is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Ecuador’s most recent MER is available in Spanish only at:  http://www.gafilat.info/index.php/es/biblioteca-virtual/miembros/ecuador/evaluaciones-mutuas-7/131-ecuador-3era-ronda-2011.     AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES    Despite its progress, Ecuador needs to implement additional AML/CFT reforms.  Corruption, inadequate training for law enforcement and the judiciary, and frequent misinterpretation of the law are primary AML deficiencies.  Judges are often susceptible to bribery and frequently hinder narcotics-related money laundering investigations.  The prosecutorial office handling money laundering cases only has five AML-dedicated prosecutors nationwide, suffers from reputational deficiencies, and has been subject to political pressures to shelve cases.  A lack of coordination and trust among law enforcement, the Attorney General’s Office (AGO), and financial regulators hinders AML efforts.     \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  94  Regulatory authorities are still in the initial stages of implementing a risk-based AML/CFT supervisory approach.  The effectiveness of AML/CFT compliance examinations and the enforcement framework still need strengthening.  UAFE can administratively sanction reporting entities only for missing monthly reporting deadlines.  Although stipulated by law, sanctions do not increase for recidivism.  UAFE has no administrative sanctioning authority for failure to report or otherwise act on a suspicious transaction but must rely on the AGO to investigate.    State prosecutors are required to inform a suspect s/he is under investigation for money laundering, which may provide opportunities for persons to obscure or destroy key evidence.   Bulk cash smuggling investigations must be completed within 30 days, hampering convictions.  The law only stipulates administrative fines for failure to declare cash/currency at a port of entry but not other financial instruments.  Only international air travelers bringing in over $10,000 in cash or other “taxable assets” are required to submit a customs declaration form.    Legislation to implement a non-conviction-based asset forfeiture framework still languishes in the National Assembly.  In addition, Ecuador must strengthen its mechanisms for seizing, managing, and disposing of illicit assets, which suffer from archaic bureaucratic policies and procedures.     The constitution permits trials in absentia and voids the statute of limitations for government officials on trial for specified crimes, but not for money laundering.  As a result, officials under investigation for money laundering flee Ecuador until the statute of limitations expires, hindering prosecutions.     ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   UAFE referred 10 possible money laundering cases to the AGO between January and October 2020.  The government does not publish statistics on money laundering-related prosecutions and convictions.     Pursuing public corruption is a top priority for President Moreno’s government.  In 2020, the AGO formed a multidisciplinary task force to investigate corruption cases related to public procurement during the COVID-19 health emergency, including the Pedernales Hospital case in which National Assembly members and public procurement officials are implicated.  The AGO secured eight judgments derived from bribery investigations in 2020.  Authorities continue to investigate and prosecute high-level government officials for bribery, embezzlement, illicit enrichment, money laundering, and organized crime.  The AGO also continues to investigate allegations against PetroEcuador and the Brazilian construction company Odebrecht and to seek the recovery of $14 million in this case.   The National Court of Justice convicted in absentia former president Rafael Correa on corruption charges.         \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  95  El Salvador   OVERVIEW   El Salvador continued to make significant progress in combating money laundering during 2020, primarily due to efforts of the Attorney General’s (AG) office.  Poor regulatory AML/CFT oversight and enforcement, particularly with respect to DNFBPs, continue to make El Salvador more vulnerable to money laundering.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   El Salvador is geographically vulnerable to the transit of South American cocaine to the United States.  El Salvador’s dollarized economy makes it attractive for money launderers, and money laundering risks include organized crime, human trafficking, extortion, tax evasion, and corruption.  A regional agreement among El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua allows for the free movement of their citizens.    El Salvador is a cash-based economy in which only 25 percent of the population uses bank accounts.  The government has identified several trade-based schemes stemming from lax border and customs controls.  In addition, lax regulatory AML oversight and enforcement, particularly with respect to DNFBPs, make El Salvador more vulnerable to money laundering.   Organized crime groups launder money through various means, including front companies, travel agencies, remittances, import and export goods, and cargo transportation.  Illicit activity includes the use of smurfing operations.    As of December 2019, there were 17 FTZs operating in El Salvador.  The FTZs are comprised of more than 200 companies operating in areas such as textiles, clothing, distribution centers, call centers, business process outsourcing, agribusiness, agriculture, electronics, and metallurgy.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Legislation to address regulatory and supervisory issues related to coordination and authorities and provide comprehensive AML/CFT reforms is pending within the legislative assembly.   El Salvador is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/el-salvador-1.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The lack of strong regulatory bodies to properly supervise and enforce the law in all sectors remains a significant problem.  El Salvador’s regulatory institutions are either nonexistent or weak and are not authorized to fine or punish noncompliance.  Affected sectors include some financial services in the traditional banking sector, such as savings and loans cooperatives, and other DNFBPs, to include casinos, real estate agents, dealers in precious metals/stones, and \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  96  professional services (notaries, accountants, and lawyers).  Poor coordination and information-sharing between El Salvador’s FIU and other regulatory bodies is also problematic.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   El Salvador’s FIU is understaffed with only 19 permanent staff members, including three attorneys and seven analysts.  Criminal investigations and prosecutions are primarily handled by the AG’s specialized Group Against Impunity (GCI), made up of approximately 20 prosecutors and 14 analysts, and a separate AML unit currently made up of 14 prosecutors and five financial analysts.   Because there is little regulatory enforcement with respect to international transfers, regulatory authorities in El Salvador do not have the capacity to tell whether money laundering methods are being used to launder criminal proceeds or fund terrorist activities.    In fiscal year 2020, the GCI reported filing criminal charges in several high-profile cases, including against the former president of the legislative assembly Sigfredo Reyes and the former president of the state audit institution Hernán Contreras Rodríguez.  The Money Laundering Unit also reported a number of significant ongoing cases, which are still in judicial proceedings, involving drug-trafficking organizations, one of which involves $5.5 million in laundered proceeds and the other $17.8 million.  The unit also reported progress on two corruption cases involving former president Carlos Mauricio Funes.   In addition, Salvadoran prosecutors won an appeal in the first money laundering case against leaders and collaborators of the MS-13 gang, in what is widely known as Caso Jaque.  In July 2020, the appellate court reversed acquittals from a 2018 trial against several MS-13 members and associates on money laundering charges.  The Court of Appeals found ample evidence to support money laundering convictions against the charged defendants and that the trial court had erred by not giving sufficient weight to circumstantial evidence presented at trial.  The Court of Appeals ordered a re-trial on the money laundering charges included in the case.     Georgia   OVERVIEW  As with narcotics, Georgia is part of an international system of money laundering.  Georgia’s ease of doing business attracts investments, but also eases entry of ill-gotten funds into the financial system.  In June 2020, the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS), Georgia’s FIU, adopted new regulations to further define Georgia’s AML/CFT regulatory framework, and law enforcement utilized monitoring mechanisms created in previous years to identify links between drugs, organized crime, and money laundering.  Much of the illegal income in Georgia derives from banking fraud and cybercrime.  Cryptocurrency is unregulated in Georgia and is an area that Georgia should address, along with its gaming industry.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  97  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Considerable illegal income in Georgia derives from banking fraud and cybercrime.  Social engineering schemes are also used to commit mass marketing fraud.  Banking systems and money transfer services are the primary means to move funds, and Georgia is often just one link in an international criminal chain.  The general economic situation in Georgia, which is far from being a developed economy, forms fruitful ground for money launderers to find front men.  Ease of doing business, which enhances Georgia’s attractiveness for clean investments, is a vehicle for ill-gotten funds to enter the financial system.  Cryptocurrency is unregulated in Georgia, increasing vulnerability to money laundering.  Based on the monitoring mechanism created in previous years, prosecutors established links between drugs, organized crime, and money laundering.    The unchecked growth of the gaming industry, including internet gaming, is concerning.  According to the FMS January 2019 annual report, there are 449 lotteries and gaming institutions registered in Georgia and 34 casinos.  The Ministry of Finance supervises lottery organizations, gaming institutions, and casinos for AML compliance.  The AML obligations of gaming establishments are identical or substantively similar to the requirements placed on other covered entities.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Georgia has an adequate legal and institutional framework for investigating and prosecuting money laundering offenses.    As required by its Law on Facilitating the Prevention of Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing, Georgia further refined its AML/CFT regulatory framework by realigning key guidelines, including rules on record-keeping, storage requirements, and reporting of information to the FMS, and creating new customer identification and verification procedures.  The new rules introduce reporting timeframes, take a risk-based approach, and promote increased efficiency.  The law applies EDD to both domestic and foreign PEPs.       Georgia’s civil procedure code permits civil forfeiture of any undocumented property in the possession of persons convicted for money laundering or other designated offenses.      Georgia is a member of MONEYVAL, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.coe.int/en/web/moneyval/jurisdictions/georgia.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Bitcoin and other virtual currencies are extremely popular in Georgia.  Georgia continues to be a popular virtual currency mining location.  Georgia lacks experienced cybercrime labs and only has a handful of qualified digital forensic analysts.  Training and capacity-building efforts need to be directed toward these areas and toward improving legislation on collecting and analyzing digital evidence.  The Prosecution Service of Georgia (PSG) recently created a new cybercrime \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  98  department and is in the process of developing cryptocurrency seizure guidelines to be used in the law enforcement community.    Over the last two years, the number of STRs submitted by gaming businesses has increased from 1 in 2018 to 10 in 2020.  This change is attributed to government efforts to establish monitoring departments within the gaming entities, develop guidelines on the reporting requirements for gaming businesses, and implement awareness-raising programs.  However, the overall number of reports is still suspiciously low and may indicate the gaming industry may not be fully complying with existing regulations.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Georgia’s 2019 money laundering/terrorism financing NRA weights money laundering risks as medium and terrorism financing risks as low.  Georgian prosecutors and law enforcement authorities should continue to put emphasis on pursuing links between organized crime and money laundering.  The PSG utilized newly secured software to help uncover connections and data patterns and assist in identifying and disrupting money laundering threats.  Georgia has policy-level interagency cooperation but lacks a task-force approach at the operational level.  A task-force approach would facilitate greater exchange of information and cooperation, pulling together intelligence and resources to attack financial crimes.  Georgia also should take steps to supervise and improve regulation of its gaming industry.    The PSG uses a multi-agency platform with law enforcement and the FMS to analyze cases, generalize practices, and identify current trends in profit-motivated crimes.  Investigations into narcotics, extortion, weapons of mass destruction, human trafficking, prostitution, and smuggling rarely disclose financial components.  Narcotics trafficking is rarely established as a predicate offense for money laundering.  In 2020, several successful money laundering cases were linked to drug trafficking and other organized crime involving large sums of money; however, the overall number of money laundering cases is low compared to the number of predicate offenses.  In fiscal year (FY) 2020, 36 money laundering prosecutions were initiated, compared to 25 in FY2019.  In FY2020, two people were convicted of money laundering; the PSG attributes the low conviction rate to delayed court proceedings due to COVID-19 restrictions.  STRs still remain the main source of money laundering investigations.  Georgia should increase the efficiency of parallel investigations, and more effectively utilize forfeiture laws.    Ghana   OVERVIEW  Ghana’s AML laws continue to be in line with international standards, and the country is working to implement its AML regime across all sectors and institutions.  Ghana is continuing to consolidate its banking and financial sectors, with new capital requirements and corporate governance standards reducing the number of banks and non-bank financial institutions \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  99  operating in the country.  This, along with a positive trajectory of improved banking supervision, could simplify oversight but should not adversely affect the filing of STRs and CTRs.   In September 2019, Ghana developed a national AML/CFT policy and action plan to address the strategic deficiencies identified in the 2016 NRA.  An action plan created in 2018 addresses strategic deficiencies noted by international experts.  Ghana should continue to work on ensuring the timely access to accurate and current beneficial ownership information; ensuring the Ghana Financial Intelligence Center (FIC), the FIU, is focusing its activities on risks identified in the NRA; and applying a risk-based approach for monitoring NPOs.  In terms of both the legal framework and risk, NPOs and DNFBPs continue to represent the largest gaps in Ghana’s AML regime. To address these and other money laundering issues, the government of Ghana should continue to allocate adequate funding to fight money laundering, effectively implement relevant asset forfeiture laws and regulations, and sanction institutions that do not file required STRs and CTRs.     The FIC continues to work with international partners to conduct trainings for law enforcement agencies, though that effort has stalled due to COVID-19.  Ghana continues to work on a nationwide capacity building workshop on AML/CFT and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction for law enforcement agencies in several regions of the country.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Fraud, especially romance scams, theft, tax evasion, corruption, and drug trafficking continue to be the most prevalent crimes for money laundering in Ghana.  Advanced fee fraud is the most commonly committed offense.  Other predicate offenses that pose medium money laundering threats include human trafficking, migrant smuggling, organized crime, arms trafficking, counterfeiting of currency, counterfeiting and piracy of products, environmental crime, and forgery.   DNFBPs are vulnerable to money laundering.  Major vulnerabilities are the lack of enforcement and ineffective adherence to CDD requirements by most DNFBPs.  Ghana continues to work toward sector-specific AML guidelines but lacks a robust risk assessment methodology for the DNFBP sector.  The FIC conducted a nationwide AML/CFT training session for targeted DNFBPs in 2019.  It also conducted risk assessments of legal persons and arrangements and of NGOs.  Follow-up in 2020 was delayed due to COVID-19.  Ghana is a cash-dominant economy, and bulk cash smuggling is the preferred money laundering scheme.  Ghana has designated four FTZ areas, but only one is active.  Ghana also licenses factories outside the FTZ areas as free zone companies; most produce garments and processed foods.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  100  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Ghana’s principal AML legislation is the Anti-Money Laundering Act, 2008, as amended by the Anti-Money Laundering Amendment, 2014.  AML guidelines were most recently revised in January 2018.   Ghana has comprehensive KYC and STR regulations and legal persons are covered.  In 2019, President Akufo-Addo signed a new companies act to include provisions to establish a beneficial ownership register managed by the Registrar General, although implementing regulations are still required to ensure compliance.   Ghana and the United States do not have a bilateral MLAT.  The foundation for extradition between Ghana and the U.S. is derived from the 1935 U.S.-U.K. treaty that was inherited by Ghana after independence in 1957.  United States-Ghana legal assistance cooperation is underpinned by various UN conventions to which both the U.S. and Ghana are parties.     Ghana is a member of the GIABA, a FATF-style regional body.  Ghana’s most recent MER is available at:  http://www.giaba.org/reports/mutual-evaluation/Ghana.html.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Banks and insurance companies are required to identify high-risk clients such as PEPs, but there is a lack of effective identification and monitoring of PEPs and their associates.   There is no organized national response in the NPO sector to combat possible money laundering or terrorist financing abuse, and submission of NPO annual financial statements and records of operation remains a challenge.  Ghana conducted a nationwide rollout of AML/CFT sensitization programs for NPOs in 2019.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Ghana’s implementation of a single national identity card is ongoing, with repeated delays.  Identification of customers for purposes of KYC remains challenging, as many of the publicly owned identity verification databases are still not fully available.  Financial crimes are prosecuted by the Attorney General’s Office and by non-attorney police prosecutors.  Relatively few investigators and prosecutors have received specialized AML training.  Ghana has no certified financial crime investigators trained in asset forfeiture.   Ghana’s FIC and international partners train public and private sector entities on current money laundering and terrorist financing trends to raise awareness and reporting to the FIC.  Ghana continues to work toward compliance with international AML standards.  Several agencies maintain combined statistics on convictions; separate data on money laundering convictions is not readily available, though international partners are working with Ghana to mitigate that issue.  In partnership with Ghana, an international donor funded the development of \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  101  an information-sharing database that connects various sectors over which the FIC has jurisdiction.  The database came online in late 2019/early 2020.   Guatemala   OVERVIEW   Guatemala remains a key transit route for narcotics to the United States and cash returning to South America.  The government faces significant challenges combating corruption, money laundering, and financial crimes related to narcotics trafficking.  The Public Ministry (MP), Guatemala’s justice department, has improved coordination between prosecutors and law enforcement agencies so as to conduct financial investigations and consider money laundering charges when investigating extortion, corruption, and trafficking investigations.  However, more progress is needed, especially in light of the influence of drug traffickers over some elected officials within Guatemalan institutions.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Guatemala’s geographical equidistance between South American coca sources and U.S. drug markets, coupled with public corruption, make Guatemala a strategically important country for drug transit and money laundering.  Guatemala’s fight against corruption has exposed criminal organizations dedicated to the planning, brokerage, execution, and concealment of illicit profits.  These structures exploit Guatemala’s public corruption, laws, and institutions and ultimately contribute to the Guatemalan government’s opaque contract implementation.    In the private sector, money laundering commonly occurs through real estate, construction, and ranching transactions.  Guatemala’s laws also provide money laundering opportunities through various categories of DNFBPs.    The Central America Four Border Control Agreement among El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua permits the free movement of citizens across shared borders without cash declaration requirements.    Casinos and games of chance operate both on and offshore and are currently unregulated.   Guatemala has 12 active FTZs, mainly used to import duty-free materials and goods used in the manufacture of products and/or provision of services for exportation.  There are no known allegations that FTZs are hubs of money laundering or drug trafficking activity.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Guatemalan Law against Money Laundering or Other Assets (LAML) regulates all aspects of money laundering prevention and enforcement.  Pursuant to the LAML, entities and professions identified in the law must report all suspicious and unusual financial activities of \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  102  their clients.  However, the LAML does not apply to numerous entities in the financial, commercial, and service sectors that are vulnerable to money laundering activity.  Guatemala and the United States do not have an MLAT.  However, the use of multilateral treaties to exchange financial crime information has led to prosecutions of significant money laundering offenses in the United States and Guatemala.  The Prosecution Office of International Affairs in the MP works closely with the U.S. Department of Justice to coordinate timely responses to financial information requests.    Guatemala is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/#Guatemala.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  Guatemala does not prohibit deposit structuring to avoid reporting requirements.      International experts noted deficiencies in Guatemala’s AML laws with respect to DNFBPs, noting that numerous professions and activities at high risk for use by money launderers were not covered by the law, including attorneys, notaries, cryptocurrency traders, micro-lenders, and casinos.  In July 2020, the Special Verification Supervisor in the Bank Superintendent’s office proposed new AML and terrorism financing legislation to address these deficiencies by expanding the professions and activities required to comply with reporting requirements and enforcing risk mitigation policies to combat money laundering and terrorism financing activities.  While the proposed legislation is being considered by the Guatemalan congress, few believe it will pass as proposed.  The lack of an MLAT with the United States creates hurdles to the repatriation of assets linked to criminal activities and to collaboration to enforce asset forfeiture orders.  In addition to legal deficiencies, the lack of coordination among domestic agencies and institutions and limited human resources have led to mixed results applying those laws, including enforcement of the AML and SAR regulations, and application of the KYC procedures.  This is problematic, as most money laundering cases prosecuted by the MP originate from bank SARs.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Guatemala struggled to enforce its AML and asset forfeiture laws in 2020, largely due to the COVID-19 pandemic closing courtrooms but also due to staffing shortages, insufficient collaboration among relevant agencies, technological shortcomings, and procedural inefficiencies.  In 2019, the MP filed indictments on 53 percent of the money laundering complaints it received, while in 2020 this percentage was 29 percent.  In 2019, the MP obtained judgements on 32 percent of the asset forfeiture cases it prosecuted, however in 2020 this fell to 17 percent.    Although the pandemic has created complications for the MP, Guatemala had some important successes in 2020.  The MP uncovered more than $15 million in cash hidden in the residence of a former minister wanted for money laundering.  Another former minister of economy was \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  103  charged in the United States for alleged money laundering.  The storage of cash by corrupt actors may indicate they are deterred from using financial institutions to launder money due to the inherent risks created by existing AML regulations and procedures.     Guyana   OVERVIEW  Unregulated currency exchange houses and dealers in precious metals and stones pose risks to Guyana’s AML/CFT system.  Other sectoral vulnerabilities include the banking industry and unregulated attorneys, accountants, real estate agents, used car dealers, and charities.  Guyana has made significant progress on the AML/CFT front, but more investigations and successful prosecutions are necessary.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Guyana’s 2017 NRA determined it has a medium-to-high money laundering risk and a medium terrorist financing threat.  Historically, the primary sources of laundered funds are narcotics trafficking and real estate fraud.  However, other illicit activities, such as human trafficking, gold smuggling, contraband, and tax evasion are also sources.  Guyana’s weak licensing policies and procedures followed by Guyana’s banking and financial institutions increase the risk of drug money laundering.  Guyana does not have FTZs, offshore financial centers, virtual currency platforms, or economic citizenship programs.  Guyana does permit gaming, and the Gaming Authority of the Republic of Guyana (GARG) regulates and supervises all gaming activities.  Its website lists one licensed casino, one state lottery, and eight betting shops.  Common money laundering typologies include large cash deposits using forged agreements of sale for non-existent precious minerals, cross-border transport of concealed precious metals to avoid payment of the relevant taxes and duties, and wire transfer fraud using compromised email accounts.  More recently, suspected illegal funds are transferred via international financial institutions under the guise of making purchases for COVID-19 medical supplies.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Guyana has strong legislation relating to money laundering and terrorist financing.  Guyana’s Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism Act 2009, Interception of Communications Act 2008, and Criminal Law Procedure Act serve as its primary AML legislative regime.  The State Assets Recovery Act of 2017, Protected Disclosures Act of 2018, and the National Payments Systems Act of 2018 bolster Guyana’s AML legislative response.    Guyana has comprehensive KYC and STR regulations.  There is also a records exchange mechanism in place with the United States and other governments.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  104  In January 2020, the government started its second NRA.  The government estimates it will be concluded early in 2021.  International donors trained government financial sector personnel and legal officers on the use of the NRA tool and on AML best practices in the oil and gas sector and illegal wildlife trade.  The Bank of Guyana, Guyana Securities Council, GARG, and Guyana Revenue Authority conducted several onsite inspections of financial entities to identify areas for improvement.  Guyana is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/member-countries/guyana.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Guyana’s AML legislation covers legal persons and provides EDD for PEPs.  However, the government identified remaining deficiencies within its AML legislative framework it intends to correct, including information-sharing restrictions on the FIU and the exclusion of international organizations from the definition of PEPs.  Guyana lacks standardized provisions for secure electronic communications and transactions.  The government has a risk-based assessment plan from its 2017 NRA but lacks a national strategic plan for combatting money laundering and terrorist financing.  The Electronic Communications and Transaction Bill and an AML/CFT national strategic plan remain in draft form, and the government did not report when these would be finalized.  The FIU applied for Egmont Group membership in 2011 but its application is still pending.  Guyana has satisfied some of the Egmont Group’s criteria, however, has yet to comply fully with the Egmont Group’s recommended changes to its AML/CFT Act.  The Egmont Group recommends the Act define the “relevant authority” to receive and investigate FIU reports and include provisions to give the FIU the power to exchange financial information and to independently enter into agreements with foreign FIUs.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The major agencies involved in anti-drug and AML efforts are the Guyana Police Force, Guyana Revenue Authority (GRA), Customs Anti-Narcotics Unit, Special Organized Crimes Unit (SOCU), Bank of Guyana, and the FIU within the Ministry of Finance.  The government disbanded the State Asset Recovery Agency and National Anti-Narcotic Agency in October 2020.    The FIU initiates investigations by referring cases to SOCU.  The FIU submitted eight STRs in 2020.  SOCU launched investigations into these and other reports of suspicious transactions, and in September 2020 made a successful application for forfeiture of $28,000 believed to be the proceeds of narcotics trafficking and money laundering.  The government reports statutory time limits to prosecute money laundering cases and non-cooperation by stakeholders with SOCU hinder successful prosecutions.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  105  The government has shown strong political will to combat money laundering and has made progress on the AML/CFT front.  Guyana still needs to increase its training for the judiciary on matters pertaining to the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes.  A national strategic plan for combatting money laundering should be developed and implemented, and legislation passed for the facilitation and regulation of secure electronic communications and transactions.  Reporting and investigating entities should also improve their interagency coordination, and the GRA should report suspicious transactions to SOCU.   Haiti   OVERVIEW  Haitian gangs are engaged in international drug trafficking and other criminal and fraudulent activity.  While Haiti itself is not a major financial center, regional narcotics and money laundering enterprises utilize Haitian couriers, primarily via maritime routes.  Much of the drug trafficking in Haiti, and related money laundering, is connected to the United States.  Important legislation was adopted over the past several years, in particular anticorruption and AML laws, but the weakness of the Haitian judicial system, impunity, and a lack of political will leave the country vulnerable to corruption and money laundering.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Most of the identified money laundering schemes involve significant amounts of U.S. currency held in financial institutions outside of Haiti or non-financial entities in Haiti, such as restaurants and other small businesses.  A majority of property confiscations to date have involved significant drug traffickers convicted in the United States.  Illicit proceeds are also generated from corruption, embezzlement of government funds, smuggling, counterfeiting, kidnappings for ransom, illegal emigration and associated activities, and tax fraud.  Foreign currencies represent approximately 63 percent of Haiti’s bank deposits.  Haiti has nine operational FTZs.  FTZs are licensed and regulated by the Free Zones National Council, a public-private enterprise.  AML laws and regulations apply to companies operating in FTZs.   Haiti has 157 licensed casinos and many unlicensed casinos.  Gaming entities are subject to AML requirements.  Haiti also has established the Haitian State Lottery under the auspices of the Ministry of Economy and Finance.  Online gaming is illegal.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Amendments in 2016 further strengthen Haiti’s 2013 AML legislation by adding missing elements to the AML/CFT law to bring it up to international standards.  A long-delayed anticorruption bill took effect in 2014.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  106  The 2020 adoption of a new criminal code and a new criminal procedural code will provide the government with updated tools to prosecute corruption and money laundering cases.  They are expected to be implemented over a two-year transition period.  The adoption of the new codes will not itself address the historic unwillingness of judges and courts to address cases referred for prosecution because of corruption and other reasons.   Haiti is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER can be found at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer-fsrb/CFATF-Mutual-Evaluation-Republic-of-Haiti-2019%20.pdf.    AML DEFICIENCIES  The weaknesses of the Haitian judicial system and prosecutorial mechanisms continue to leave the country vulnerable to corruption and money laundering.    The amended AML/CFT law, despite strengthening the AML regulatory framework, undermines the independence and effectiveness of Haiti’s FIU.  The Central Financial Intelligence unit (UCREF), Haiti’s FIU, is not a member of the Egmont Group, but is currently working with sponsors and applying for membership.  Haiti should take steps to establish a program to identify and report the cross-border movement of currency and financial instruments.  Casinos and other forms of gaming should be better regulated and monitored.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The Haitian government’s efforts to implement a better AML regime have stalled, in part due to the COVID-19 pandemic and the absence of a constitutional government.  The 2020 adoption of a new criminal code is expected to facilitate bringing Haiti into compliance with international standards.   Haiti’s 2014 anticorruption law is not being effectively implemented, as evidenced by frequent changes in leadership, fear of reprisal at the working level, rumored intervention from the country’s executive leadership, and the failure of judges to follow through by investigating, scheduling, and referring cases to prosecutors.   The UCREF is an ineffective, passive institution with little law enforcement impact.  The UCREF does not follow-up with the prosecutor’s office regarding its referrals.  The May 2017 UCREF law reduced the UCREF’s independence.  The UCREF forwarded six cases to the judiciary in 2018, three cases in 2019, and only two in 2020.    The Haitian National Police financial crimes unit (BAFE) is understaffed and under resourced.  It has limited interaction with the UCREF.  Like the UCREF, the BAFE does not systematically follow-up with the prosecutor’s office regarding cases.  Haiti’s prosecutors and judges have limited experience with financial crimes cases.  There were no convictions or prosecutions for money laundering in 2020.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  107   The government should continue to devote resources to building an effective AML regime, to include continued support to units charged with investigating financial crimes and the development of an information technology system.  The Government of Haiti should take steps to combat pervasive corruption at all levels of government.   Honduras   OVERVIEW  Money laundering in Honduras stems primarily from narcotics trafficking by organized criminal groups and the illicit proceeds of public corruption.  Honduras is not a regional or offshore financial center.    In the last quarter of 2019, Honduras, under the leadership of the Honduran National Banking and Insurance Commission (CNBS) and with donor support, established a national strategy on AML/CFT and combating weapons of mass destruction to implement laws and regulations related to DNFBPs.  This comprehensive implementation effort involves multiple Honduran government agencies, including justice sector institutions.    However, because the DNFPB law and regulations have not been fully implemented, supervision and oversight to prevent money laundering is limited.  The lack of capacity to investigate complex financial transactions also contributes to a favorable money laundering climate.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Money laundering in Honduras derives from domestic and foreign criminal activity.  Local drug trafficking organizations and organized crime syndicates control most illicit proceeds, which pass through the formal banking system and the underground economy.  Trade-based businesses commonly used to launder funds include those operating in the automobile and real estate sectors, remittance companies, currency exchange houses, credit unions, the construction sector, and cattle ranching.    Moreover, corruption and links to organized crime in the private and public sectors continue to be widespread, with the illicit proceeds of public corruption being subject to money laundering.  A regional treaty between El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua allows free movement of citizens between these countries, leaving each country vulnerable to the cross-border movement of contraband and cash.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Honduras established a comprehensive national AML/CFT strategy in 2019.  Honduras has KYC and STR regulations, but additional procedures are necessary for full implementation of the 2015 AML law.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  108   Currently, there is no bilateral treaty between Honduras and the United States that allows for exchange of records.  However, Honduran authorities have allowed records and information exchange under the terms of relevant UN conventions that establish the process of mutual legal assistance between states parties.  Records and other documents are provided through U.S. law enforcement agencies in Honduras that can testify as to their genuineness and validity when not requested through an official mutual legal assistance request.    Honduras is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer-fsrb/GAFILAT-MER-Honduras-2016-English.pdf.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The definition of money laundering contained in the new penal code, which took effect in June 2020, presents some setbacks when compared with the previous 2015 AML law.  For example, the underlying offense for the new crime has been changed from “illicit activity” to “serious crime,” increasing the legal threshold and thus making it harder to prove.  According to the Honduran congress’ interpretation of the AML law, regulated entities must retain records of transactions for five years and the record-keeping applies to each transaction, not for the client’s entire file.  As a consequence, financial information related to possible money laundering cases could be incomplete or unavailable.  Bearer shares are legal and there is no system for beneficial ownership registration to identify and verify beneficiaries in complex financial transactions.   The Honduran financial system suspends individuals under investigation for money laundering and limits their access to the banking system.  While the AML law allows the Public Ministry (PM) to request financial information directly from the FIU, some PM units channel their requests through senior PM authorities leading to delays.  The poor information flow between the PM and the FIU has left cleared individuals on the financial risk list unnecessarily.  Regulated entities are not always notified when investigations are closed administratively.    The Superintendence of Commercial Companies, created by the Honduran constitution to supervise and regulate businesses to prevent financial related crimes, remains inactive.  There are specialized entities, such as the CNBS and the National Supervisory Council of Cooperatives (CONSUCOOP), that combat and prevent money laundering in the private sector, though CONSUCOOP lacks sufficient resources to do so effectively.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  FIU staff and PM financial analysts require training on financial institution products, international standards, financial analysis, report writing, relevant Honduran laws, and STR and CTR analysis.     The Public Records Office has made efforts to begin file digitalization at a national level, although most public property records remain in hard copy and poorly organized, impeding effective investigation.  The Property Institute, through its Intelligence Registry Office, keeps \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  109  track of real estate and vehicle operations susceptible to money laundering.  Announced in 2016, this initiative is becoming operational with the support of CNBS and once fully implemented will help prevent corruption and collect information for money laundering investigations.  With donor support over several years, Honduras officially established the Financial Investigation Police Office (OPIF) as a unit within the Honduran National Police.  Previously an ad hoc investigation unit, it is now recognized under Honduran law, conducting financial investigations related to money laundering and asset forfeiture.    Hong Kong   OVERVIEW  Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People’s Republic of China, is an international financial and trading hub.  The world’s sixth-largest banking center in terms of external transactions and the fourth-largest foreign exchange trading center, Hong Kong does not differentiate between offshore and onshore entities for licensing and supervisory purposes and has its own U.S. dollar interbank clearing system for settling transactions.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Hong Kong’s low tax rates and simplified tax regime, coupled with its sophisticated banking system, shell company formation agents, free port status, and the absence of currency and exchange controls present vulnerabilities for money laundering, including TBML and underground finance.  Hong Kong shell companies can be exploited to launder money, facilitate illicit trade, and gain access to the international financial system.  Hong Kong officials indicate the primary sources of laundered funds are from local and overseas criminal activity, fraud and financial crimes, illegal gaming, loan sharking, smuggling, and vice.  Groups involved in money laundering range from local street organizations to sophisticated international syndicates involved in assorted criminal activities, including drug trafficking.    Horse races, a local lottery, and soccer betting are the only legal gaming activities, all under the direction of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, a non-profit entity that collaborates with law enforcement to disrupt illegal gaming outlets.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Hong Kong has AML legislation allowing the tracing and confiscation of proceeds derived from drug-trafficking and organized crime.  Hong Kong’s Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing (Financial Institutions) Ordinance (AMLO) details covered institutions’ compliance obligations regarding legal and supervisory requirements.  Under the AMLO, covered institutions must carry out CDD procedures.  STRs must be filed in a timely manner with Hong Kong’s Joint Financial Intelligence Unit (JFIU), which is jointly run \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  110  by the Hong Kong Police Force and the Hong Kong Customs & Excise Department (CED).  The AMLO requires DNFBPs to abide by the same set of CDD and record-keeping requirements as covered financial institutions.  Hong Kong’s Companies Ordinance (CO) further requires trust and company service providers to pass a fit and proper test and obtain a license from the companies registry.  The CO also requires companies incorporated in Hong Kong to maintain beneficial ownership information.    Hong Kong has a declaration and disclosure system to detect the movement of physical currency and bearer negotiable instruments (CBNIs) into and out of the city.  An advance declaration must be made to the CED for cargo consignments importing or exporting large quantities of CBNIs.  In June 2020, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) issued a circular applicable to remote customer account-opening facilities.  Banks and fintech firms should conduct an adequate initial AML/CFT risk assessment, adopt a risk-based approach, maintain both continuous management and monitoring of adopted technology, and continuously monitor account vulnerabilities.  In September 2020, the HKMA updated its guidance, requiring both local and international banks in Hong Kong to treat suspected breaches of the newly implemented national security law the same as AML/CFT violations and report them to the JFIU as STRs.  In September 2020, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) launched a public consultation with the goal of proposing several amendments to its AML/CFT guidelines for SFC-licensed firms.  Among the amendments, the SFC proposes enhanced CDD measures under a risk-based approach.  The SFC also suggests banning international relationships that involve shell companies and extending the cross-border correspondent relationship provisions in the AMLO to cover securities, leveraged foreign exchange, and futures contract transactions.  The deadline for responses to the consultation paper is December 18, 2020.  Hong Kong is a member of the FATF and the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/mer-hong-kong-2019.html.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   In view of significant cross-border flows of trade, finance, and banking activities, Hong Kong regulatory authorities should ensure strong cooperation with other jurisdictions in cases involving foreign predicate offenses, such as tax evasion or corruption.    Some supervisors and self-regulatory bodies, particularly those overseeing DNFBPs, need to strengthen their understanding of AML risk, develop a risk-based approach, and enhance their supervisory and enforcement actions.  Overall, limited sanctions have been applied against some sectors, including moneylenders.  Dealers in precious metals and stones and financial leasing companies are not regulated for AML/CFT purposes.       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  111  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Hong Kong has a low number of prosecutions and convictions compared to the number of cases investigated.  Under the Executive Order on Hong Kong Normalization, which directs the suspension or elimination of special and preferential treatment for Hong Kong, the United States notified the Hong Kong authorities in August 2020 of its suspension of three bilateral agreements.  In response, the Hong Kong government suspended the Agreement Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of Hong Kong on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Affairs, which entered into force in 2000.    The 1988 UN Drug Convention was extended to Hong Kong in 1997, and UNCAC and the UNTOC were extended to Hong Kong in 2006.  In 2019, the JFIU received a total of 51,588 STRs and there were 103 money laundering convictions.    India   OVERVIEW  Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi has prioritized curtailing illicit financial activity as part of his administration’s efforts to formalize and digitize India’s financial system to reduce corruption and increase the tax base.  Nonetheless, India faces various money laundering vulnerabilities such as informal financing networks that largely serve illiterate, rural citizens; complex onshore and offshore corporate structures; and enforcement capacity constraints.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  The most common money laundering methods include intermingling criminal proceeds with licit assets, purchasing bank checks with cash, routing funds through employees’ accounts, and using complex legal structures.  Transnational criminal organizations use offshore corporations and TBML to disguise the criminal origin of funds, and companies use TBML to evade capital controls.  Illicit funds continue to be laundered through gold purchases, charities, election campaigns, and educational programs.  Laundered funds are derived from tax avoidance and economic crimes, corruption, narcotics trafficking, trafficking in persons, and illegal trade.  As of October 2020, India had approved 426 Special Economic Zones (SEZs), of which 262 are operational.  India has licensed nine offshore banking units (OBUs) to operate in the SEZs.  HSBC was given approval to operate as an OBU in July 2020.  Customs officers control access to the SEZs.  OBUs have defined physical boundaries and functional limits, are prohibited from engaging in cash transactions, can only lend to the SEZ wholesale commercial sector, and are subject to the same AML regulations as the domestic sector.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  112  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Prevention of Money Laundering Act (PMLA) of 2002 and the rules by regulators Reserve Bank of India (RBI) and the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) establish the broad framework for prosecution of money laundering in India.  Since 2018, the Real Estate Regulatory Authority Act (RERAA) and the amended Benami Transactions (Prohibition) Act ensure a transparent environment for efficient and time-bound execution of projects in the real estate sector.  India has comprehensive KYC and STR requirements.  In April 2020, the RBI added a section to its KYC guidance mandating banks and non-banking financial companies (NBFC) carry out money laundering/terrorist financing risk assessment exercises periodically to identify, assess, and take effective measures to mitigate money laundering and terrorist financing risks for clients, countries or geographic areas, products, services, and transactions or delivery channels.  The RBI asked banks and NBFCs to conduct the first such internal risk assessment by June 30, 2020, and to review the assessment periodically thereafter.  The regulation of housing finance companies (HFCs) was transferred to the RBI from the National Housing Bank in August 2019.  In May 2020, the RBI required all HFCs to comply with KYC norms.    Legal persons in India are covered by criminal and civil laws against money laundering.  India uses EDD for PEPs.    To facilitate digital onboarding of customers, the RBI, in January 2020, amended the Prevention of Money-laundering (Maintenance of Records) Rules of 2005 to include the Video-based Customer Identification Process as a consent-based alternate method of establishing customers’ identity.    India is a member of the FATF and two FATF-style regional bodies, the APG and the EAG.  India’s most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/d-i/india/.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  India’s current safe harbor provision protects principal officers and compliance officers of institutions that file STRs in good faith but does not protect all employees.  The Government of India prioritizes crimes of tax evasion and counterfeit currency, while money laundering and terrorist financing are lower priorities.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  India has taken steps to implement an effective AML regime.  For example, in February 2020, SEBI clarified that foreign investors from countries designated as high-risk for money laundering will continue to be eligible for registration in India but will face tougher KYC procedures, as well as heightened compliance and regulatory scrutiny.  In January 2020, the RBI imposed a monetary penalty for non-compliance with KYC and AML requirements on payment system operators and banks under the Payment and Settlement Systems Act of 2007.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  113  In March 2020, the Indian Supreme Court allowed dealings in cryptocurrency, removing an earlier RBI ban on trading in virtual currencies, including bitcoin.   Despite the government’s efforts, deficiencies remain.  Observers and law enforcement professionals express concern about effective implementation and enforcement of the current laws, especially with regard to criminal prosecutions.  Authorities believe India has insufficient investigators to analyze the enormous amount of potential money laundering data obtained during demonetization.   U.S. investigators have had limited success in coordinating the seizure of illicit proceeds with Indian counterparts.  While intelligence and investigative information supplied by U.S. law enforcement authorities have led to numerous money seizures, a lack of follow-through on investigative leads has prevented a more comprehensive offensive against violators and related groups.  India is demonstrating an increasing ability to act on mutual legal assistance requests but continues to struggle with institutional challenges that limit its ability to provide assistance. India has addressed shortcomings in the criminalization of money laundering, as well as its domestic framework for confiscation and provisional measures.  The government should ensure all relevant DNFBPs comply with AML regulations.  India should extend its safe harbor provision to cover all employees.  The government should use data and analytics to systematically detect trade anomalies that could indicate customs fraud, TBML, and counter-valuation in informal financial networks.   Indonesia   OVERVIEW  Indonesia remains vulnerable to money laundering due to gaps in financial system legislation and regulation, a cash-based economy, weak rule of law, and partially ineffective law enforcement institutions that lack coordination.  Risks also stem from corruption and tax avoidance, followed by drug trafficking, and to a lesser extent illegal logging, wildlife trafficking, theft, bank fraud, embezzlement, credit card fraud, and the sale of counterfeit goods.  Proceeds from these predicate crimes are laundered through the banking, capital markets, real estate, and motor vehicle sectors.  Proceeds are also laundered offshore and then repatriated to Indonesia as needed.  Indonesia is making progress to counter vulnerabilities.  Authorities continue to release regulations geared toward a risk-based approach, and there is, generally, a high level of technical compliance with AML standards.  As to coordination between the government and financial sector, only moderate improvements are needed.  Areas for improvement remain analytical training for law enforcement, raising judicial authorities’ awareness of relevant offenses, increasing technical capacity to conduct financial investigations as a routine component of criminal cases, and more education for financial services sector personnel.  In addition, to conduct meaningful asset tracing investigators and prosecutors need better access to complete banking records, a process hindered by the bank secrecy laws.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  114  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Indonesia is vulnerable to the smuggling of illicit goods, controlled commodities, and bulk cash, made easier by poorly controlled coastlines, lax law enforcement, and poor customs infrastructure.  Proceeds from illicit activities are easily moved offshore and repatriated for commercial and personal use.  Endemic corruption remains a concern.  FTZs are not a major concern.  However, information sharing between Malaysia and Indonesia concerning illicit cargo transiting the FTZs within the Strait of Malacca should be improved.   Indonesia has bolstered cooperation regionally to disrupt terrorist networks, and related financial flows are shifting toward greater use of informal channels.  The trend is financing smaller terrorism attacks through use of domestic contributions requested and made through social media and nonprofit organizations.  These networks are also increasingly using sophisticated efforts to avoid monitoring and detection of communications.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  KYC requirements have been part of Indonesia’s AML regime since 2001.  PEPs are subject to EDD.  In 2018, the president issued Presidential Regulation 13, and in 2019, the Ministry of Law and Human Rights issued implementing regulations 15 and 21 calling for the disclosure of beneficial owners.  In May 2017, Indonesia issued an executive order giving Indonesian tax authorities better access to financial accountholder data and providing legal cover to exchange accountholder data under the OECD’s Global Forum Automatic Exchange of Information.  Indonesia is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.apgml.org/documents/search-results.aspx?keywords=Indonesia.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The primary factors hindering the fight against narcotics-related money laundering are investigators’ insufficient access to complete banking information due to the bank secrecy law, the lack of analytical training for law enforcement personnel, and insufficient training on money laundering detection and reporting for lower-level workers in the financial services sector.  Since most money laundering in Indonesia is related to corruption, the legal revisions to the Corruption Eradication Commission Law in September 2019, which have undermined the commission’s independence and led to a decrease in the number and quality of corruption cases, will likely lead to more money laundering risks and less enforcement.  According to commission statistics, the commission prosecuted 25 new cases in the first half of 2020, compared with 127 new cases for the full year in 2019.     While Indonesia has made progress in addressing major technical deficiencies related to UNSCR financial sanctions, issues remain, such as Indonesian’s failure to implement UN listings without delay and the lack of a clear prohibition on providing funds or financial services to designated \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  115  persons.  More effective information sharing with international law enforcement is also needed to make Indonesia a more meaningful partner in international AML/CFT efforts.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  In 2017, Indonesia conducted a national money laundering/terrorist financing risk assessment and is taking steps to implement applicable agreements and conventions.  Combating narcotics abuse is a priority for the current administration, and Indonesia recognizes the need for international cooperation.  The Indonesian Financial Transaction Reports and Analysis Center (PPATK), Indonesia’s FIU, invites the public to report any suspicious transactions.  PPATK publishes a monthly report summarizing reporting activity.  In addition to CTR and STR data, PPATK and the Ministry of Finance’s Directorate General of Customs and Excise jointly publish a cash carry report to track physical cross-border transfers of cash.  For the period January-June 2020, PPATK referred 240 results of Analysis STRs, reports that follow-up on the initial notifications provided by financial institutions, to investigators – a 3.2 percent reduction year over year.  Most were alleged corruption cases.  For the period January-June 2020, PPATK produced 12 examination reports, the same number as the prior year.  There were eight money laundering convictions between January-June 2020.    Iran   OVERVIEW   Iran has a large underground economy, spurred in part by uneven taxation, widespread Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) corruption and smuggling, sanctions evasion, currency exchange controls, and a large Iranian expatriate community.  Pervasive corruption continues within Iran’s ruling and religious elite, the IRGC, government ministries, and government-controlled business enterprises.  Iran remains a major transit route for opiates smuggled from Afghanistan.    In 2011, the United States identified Iran as a state of primary money laundering concern pursuant to Section 311 of the USA PATRIOT Act.  On October 25, 2019, FinCEN issued a final rule under this authority prohibiting the opening or maintaining of a correspondent account in the United States for or on behalf of an Iranian financial institution.  The rule also prohibits foreign financial institutions’ correspondent accounts at covered U.S. financial institutions from processing transactions involving Iranian financial institutions.  Additionally, the FATF has repeatedly warned of the risk of terrorist financing posed by Iran and the threat this presents to the international financial system.  From 2016 until February 2020, the FATF suspended its call for countermeasures against Iran in response to a high-level political commitment from Iran’s government to implement certain reforms, outlined in a 10-step action plan.  In February 2020, due to Iran’s failure to complete its action plan the FATF lifted its suspension of countermeasures, calling on all jurisdictions to impose effective countermeasures on Iran.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  116  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Iran’s merchant community makes active use of MVTS, including hawaladars and moneylenders.  Leveraging the worldwide hawala network, Iranians make money transfers globally.  Counter-valuation in hawala transactions is often accomplished via trade; TBML is a prevalent form of money laundering.   In 1984, the Department of State designated Iran as a State Sponsor of Terrorism.  Iran continues to provide material support, including resources and guidance, to multiple terrorist organizations and other groups that undermine the stability of the Middle East and Central Asia.  In April 2019, the United States designated Iran’s IRGC as a foreign terrorist organization.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Iran has criminalized money laundering and has KYC and STR requirements.  Iran has a declaration system for the cross-border transportation of currency.  The declaration system is applicable at 14 points of entry, applies to amounts over approximately $11,500 (€10,000), and requires Iranian Bank Melli, which is designated by the U.S. Treasury Department for its link to the IRGC-Qods Force (IRGC-QF), to take temporary custody of the currency until it is cleared for passage in or out of Iran.    Iran is not a member of a FATF-style regional body but is an observer to the EAG.  Its FIU is not a member of the Egmont Group.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   In October 2007, the FATF issued its first public statement expressing concern over Iran’s lack of a comprehensive AML/CFT framework.  Beginning in 2009, the FATF urged all jurisdictions to apply effective countermeasures to protect their financial sectors from the money laundering/terrorist financing risks emanating from Iran.  The Iranian regime subsequently pledged to complete a FATF-generated action plan but failed to complete the items in the action plan before the plan expired in January 2018.  Most critically, Iran failed to ratify the UNTOC and Terrorist Financing Convention.  Supreme Leader Khamenei questioned Iran’s joining the international conventions on terrorist financing and money laundering, which many hardliners argued might limit Iran’s ability to finance Hamas and Hizballah.  Subsequently, in February 2020, the FATF lifted its suspension of countermeasures, calling on all jurisdictions to impose effective countermeasures on Iran, such as requiring financial institutions to review, amend, or if necessary, terminate correspondent relationships with Iranian banks or limiting business relationships or financial transactions with Iran.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   For more than two decades, the United States has undertaken targeted financial actions, including through statutes and more than a dozen EOs, against key Iranian financial institutions, other entities, and individuals.   Iran has an asset forfeiture system, but it is not fully compliant with international standards.  Although there is no information sharing agreement with the United States, Iran cooperates with other jurisdictions on money laundering matters.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  117  On November 5, 2018, the United States re-imposed all U.S. nuclear-related sanctions against Iran.  The sanctions target critical sectors of Iran’s economy and certain transactions involving insurance providers, the Central Bank of Iran (CBI), and other designated Iranian financial institutions.  These include sanctions authorities with respect to certain transactions between foreign financial institutions and the CBI or designated Iranian financial institutions and on the provision of specialized financial messaging services to the CBI and specified Iranian financial institutions.  On November 5, 2018, OFAC placed more than 700 individuals, entities, aircraft, and vessels on the list of Specially Designated Nationals and Blocked Persons.  Since 2018, the Departments of State and the Treasury have used the full range of sanctions authorities to target hundreds of Iranian persons involved in activities in support of Iranian-sponsored terrorism, proliferation, and oil-related schemes, among others, including the September 2019 designation under EO 13224 of the CBI, which provided billions of dollars to the IRGC-QF and to Hizballah.    Italy   OVERVIEW  According to the IMF, in 2020 Italy’s economy was ranked eighth largest in the world and the third largest in the Eurozone.  Italy has a sophisticated AML regime and legal framework.  However, increasingly agile and complex organized criminal enterprises and a flourishing black-market economy pose significant risks to the financial system.  According to the Italian National Statistics Institute, the black market accounts for 12.1 percent of GDP, or approximately $235 billion.  Tax crimes also represent a significant risk and have been identified as accounting for 75 percent of all proceeds-generating crime in Italy.   While on the rise, CDD and suspicious transaction reporting remain weak among non-financial sectors, and regulations and enforcement are inconsistent.  Italy adopted laws implementing the Fifth EU AML Directive with decree no. 125/2019.  New CDD provisions went into effect in January 2020 that require firms to focus on non-face-to-face operations and impose additional procedures to confirm the identification of clients.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The COVID-19 health emergency exposed the financial system to threats related to the procurement of medical equipment and supplies and the repackaging of unpaid medical invoices into specialized debt products to facilitate money laundering.  Front companies for organized crime working in the Italian healthcare sector managed to offload invoices owed to them by regional health authorities to unwitting intermediaries, who then sold them on again to legitimate financial companies.  The economic weakening of families and small-and-medium enterprises has also increased the risks of predatory lending and the infiltration of firms by criminal organizations.  Large flows of public aid could also be subject to misuse or misappropriation by regional and local government officials.   Drug trafficking continues to be a primary source of income for Italy’s organized crime groups, which exploit Italy’s strategic location and maritime trade linkages to do business with criminal \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  118  organizations around the globe.  Other major sources of laundered money are proceeds from tax evasion and value-added tax (VAT) fraud, smuggling and sale of counterfeit goods, marketing internet protocol television, extortion, and waste trafficking.    Law enforcement investigations have identified an increasing use of TBML schemes and virtual currencies to launder and disguise illicit proceeds and payments through legitimate trade transactions.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   The Ministry of Economy and Finance is host to the Financial Security Committee, which establishes policy regarding financial transactions and AML efforts.  The committee updated Italy’s NRA in 2019.  The Bank of Italy (BOI) continues to issue guidance on CDD measures to support banks and financial intermediaries with the development of their CDD policies.   In response to the continuing challenges of money laundering, the Italian government enacted decree law no. 125/2019, which clarifies virtual currency treatment under AML statutes, further empowers law enforcement authorities investigating money laundering, and imposes additional CDD obligations on financial intermediaries.  Also, financial penalties assessed by Italian financial sector supervisors against legal and natural persons for AML breaches have been increased to be more dissuasive.   Italy has a bilateral MLAT with the United States.   Italy is a member of the FATF.  Its most recent MER can be found at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/MER-Italy-2016.pdf.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Italy’s legislative framework is in line with the EU’s Fifth AML directive.  Italy’s centralized national bank account database now links to a new registry of owners (and beneficiaries) of firms, trusts, and legal contracts, as per the new AML directive.    DNFBPs are not required to apply enhanced CDD when dealing with domestic PEPs.  DNFBPs also are not legally required to file a STR when the beneficial owner is not identified in a business transaction.  Authorities plan to continue to implement measures to significantly increase the number of STRs filed by DNFBPs.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The criminalization of self-money laundering increases the severity of convictions for this crime and acts as a deterrent.  The provision, in force since 2016, is now extensively used both by investigative authorities and prosecutors and has proved effective in tax evasion cases.   The Financial Intelligence Unit (UIF) is the government’s main body for collecting and analyzing STRs, which are circulated to specialized law enforcement agencies (Guardia di Finanza, Defense Intelligence Agency; and the Anti-Mafia Investigative Directorate).   In 2019, \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  119  the UIF expanded the use of its information-sharing database, which allows more fluid and automated information exchanges with judicial authorities and rapid access to underlying transaction data.  The UIF (in collaboration with the BOI) developed artificial intelligence detection of suspicious transactions.  In 2019, the UIF received 105,789 STRs; 7,759 more than the previous year.    Italian authorities have strong policy cooperation and coordination, and Italy continues to develop national AML policies informed by the NRA.  Law enforcement agencies have been successful in undertaking complex financial investigations and prosecutions and have confiscated large amounts of criminal proceeds.  Confiscation of assets and proceeds is a fully integrated policy objective as a strategic action to counter money laundering offenses.    Jamaica   OVERVIEW   Money laundering in Jamaica is largely perpetrated by organized criminal groups, including some with links to powerful Jamaicans.  The country recorded a large number of financial crimes related to advance fee fraud (lottery scams), corruption, counterfeit goods, small arms trafficking, and cybercrime.       On September 1, 2020, the Jamaican Financial Investigations Division (FID), which includes the FIU, went live with its electronic portal, which allows businesses that fall under Jamaica’s Terrorism Protection Act (TPA) to report transactions over $10,000 online and provides the FID with a reporting and intelligence tool.    The Government of Jamaica continues to enforce the asset forfeiture provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act (POCA) with moderate success, but the law still is not being implemented to its fullest potential due to difficulties prosecuting and achieving convictions in financial crime cases.  Law enforcement, prosecutors, and the judiciary lack sufficient resources and training to investigate and prosecute financial crimes efficiently and effectively.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Political and public corruption generate and facilitate illicit funds and activity.  Money laundering in Jamaica is primarily related to proceeds from illegal narcotics, weapons trafficking, financial fraud schemes, corruption, and extortion.  The activities are largely perpetrated by violent, organized criminal groups, some associated with powerful and influential Jamaicans.  Many of the financial crimes related to cybercrime and financial fraud schemes target U.S. citizens.  There is also significant illicit trade of small arms and narcotics to and from Jamaica, the United States, and Haiti, which generate large amounts of illicit wealth in Jamaica.       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  120  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  In October 2019, the government tabled in parliament the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act 2019, the Terrorism Prevention (Amendment) and United Nations Security Resolution Implementation (Amendment) Acts 2019.  This was followed by the tabling of regulations to implement POCA in November 2019.  The amendments were largely a response to international experts’ recommendations.   The POCA permits post-conviction forfeiture, cash seizures, and the civil forfeiture of assets related to criminal activity.  The FID continues to work with partners in the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) and others to pursue cases that could result in seizure of assets.    The Banking Services Act allows for stronger enforcement powers and greater information sharing among the Bank of Jamaica, the Financial Services Commission, and foreign counterparts.  Several DNFBPs, such as real estate dealers, accountants, gaming establishments, and casinos, are subject to AML preventative measures.   Jamaica is a member of the CFAFT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/jamaica-1.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The FID is a statutory body within the Ministry of Finance.  The Minister of Finance must provide approval for the FIU to make arrangements or engage with foreign entities on exchange of information.  This is a limitation to the operational independence of the FIU.   Lengthy delays in investigating and prosecuting cases hinder the effectiveness of the Jamaican judicial system.  As a result, money laundering cases are hampered by the general backlog of criminal cases in the courts.  The Jamaican courts and prosecutors have been unable to keep pace with an increase in crime.   Law enforcement and prosecutors tend to pursue predicate offenses to money laundering, rather than pursuing money laundering as a stand-alone offense, due to the necessity of proving the unlawful conduct from which the laundering activity derives.  In cases where money laundering offenses are investigated and charged in conjunction with a predicate offense, prosecutors sometimes dismiss the money laundering charges to secure a guilty plea from the defendant.   To date, the regulatory agencies have not used their enforcement authority to sanction reporting entities for identified violations of AML/CFT regulations.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Jamaica is currently pursuing several legislative reforms to address noted deficiencies.  Financial institutions (including money remitters and exchanges) are subject to a range of preventative \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  121  measures.  These entities file an inordinately high volume of STRs annually, the vast majority of which are likely defensive filings.  The FID continues its POCA public awareness programs.    In 2019, 20 individuals were charged with money laundering predicated on either fraud, corruption, or narcotics trafficking.  In 2019, five persons were convicted for money laundering and money laundering predicated on fraud (lottery scamming).  Jamaican authorities also obtained penalty orders against drug traffickers and dealers of approximately $245,900; against a corrupt public official for approximately $134,000, and against a trader in counterfeit goods for approximately $142,900.  Overall, $998,000 was seized and $180,000 was forfeited in 2019.    On August 7, 2020, the FID forfeited $3,612 from Abdullah El-Faisal under POCA after the United States asked to extradite him because of his alleged involvement in terrorist activities.    Relevant authorities collaborate on investigations and prosecutions in major cases.  Authorities also regularly collaborate with foreign law enforcement on cases of mutual interest, and there are a number of joint initiatives to deal with such cases.  In 2019, FID conducted a variety of training and outreach programs to 1,069 individuals in various financial institutions and law enforcement entities.   Jamaica’s parliament passed legislation in 2019 to remove the Major Organized Crime and Anti-Corruption Agency from under the auspices of the JCF and make it an independent agency.  The implementing regulations are being drafted.    Kazakhstan   OVERVIEW  Corruption, TBML, and drug trafficking remain the major sources of illicit proceeds and laundered funds.  In 2020, Kazakhstan adopted terrorist financing-related amendments to its AML/CFT law to bring it into better compliance with international standards and reassessed vulnerabilities identified in its 2018 NRA.  Through public pronouncements and amendments to the law, Kazakhstan is taking steps to comply technically with international AML norms, but there were no convictions for money laundering in 2020.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The major sources of laundered proceeds are graft by public officials, tax evasion, and fraudulent financial activity, particularly transactions using foreign shell companies to launder domestic funds returned to Kazakhstan in the form of foreign investments.  In addition, smuggling of contraband and fraudulent invoicing of imports and exports remain common practices.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  122  Governmental corruption, organized crime, and a large shadow economy make the country vulnerable to money laundering and terrorist financing.  A significant part of Kazakhstan’s mineral wealth is in offshore accounts with little public scrutiny or accounting oversight.    Kazakhstan is a transit country for Afghan heroin and opiates to Europe and Russia and thus is vulnerable to drug-related money laundering, although the flow of drugs through the country, as measured by seizures, appears to be declining.  Tracking narcotics revenue remains difficult, as payments make use of informal remittance systems, such as hawala, or through the QIWI Wallet electronic payment system.       Kazakhstan’s Astana International Financial Centre (AIFC), launched in 2018, is designed to be a regional financial hub and offshore zone that offers financial services.  As of July 2020, it contains 500 firms from over 42 countries.  Banking sector assets in the AIFC were $680 million and equity capital raised encompassed $291 million.  The Astana Financial Services Authority supervises the AIFC, and a common law AIFC court system, outside of the Government of Kazakhstan’s jurisdiction, handles matters for which AIFC has issued regulations.  The AIFC court system uses Kazakhstani enforcement systems to back up its rulings.  While the AIFC court considered five cases in 2019, it only brought one (a small claims matter) to conclusion.  This AIFC enforcement mechanism appears to have worked as intended, but it remains untested in high-value, complex, or vigorously contested cases.  Kazakhstan has 12 special economic zones, none of which have been linked to money laundering.    Casinos and slot machine parlors are located only in selected territories.  The Ministry of Culture and Sport is responsible for the licensing and regulation of the gaming sector.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  In addition to its analytical role, amendments to the AML/CFT law give the Committee for Financial Monitoring of the Ministry of Finance, Kazakhstan’s FIU, supervisory responsibilities for reporting entities such as independent legal consultants, accountants, and realtors that were not previously regulated.  Other changes include establishing the asset forfeiture fund, strengthening preventive CFT measures, monitoring NGOs, and strengthening regulations implementing UNSCRs on weapons of mass destruction.    In 2020 Kazakhstan started exchanging tax information with other countries under the OECD’s Common Reporting Standard on Automatic Exchange of Financial Account Information.  To counter corruption, Kazakhstan will ban civil servants and immediate family members from holding international bank accounts.     Kazakhstan and the United States have a bilateral MLAT.  Kazakhstan is a member of the EAG, a FATF-styled regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/#Kazakhstan.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  123  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The AML/CFT law does not cover financial management firms, travel agencies, or dealers of art, antiques, and other high-value consumer goods.  These entities are not required to maintain customer information or report suspicious activity.   All reporting entities subject to the AML/CFT law are inspected by their respective regulatory agencies.  Most regulatory agencies, however, lack the resources and expertise to conduct inspections for compliance.  Largely because of cost, reporting entities (excepting banks) do not implement a risk-based approach to identifying suspicious transactions as part of their AML efforts.   There are no criminal or administrative liabilities for money laundering offenses for legal persons.  EDD is required only for foreign PEPs, whereas domestic PEPs are not subject to EDD requirements.  There is no registry of the beneficial owners of legal entities.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  During the first nine months of 2020, financial institutions in Kazakhstan submitted 523,224 STRs and 737,751 CTRs.  Twenty cases were prosecuted but there were no convictions.  The low number of money laundering investigations and convictions indicates more attention and resources should be devoted to financial investigations and training of investigators and prosecutors.    Kazakhstan is working jointly with the Stolen Assets Recovery initiative to recover proceeds of money laundering that are frozen overseas.   There is a two-tier AML/CFT certification program for private sector representatives that include both national and international components.  Most Kazakhstani banks have at least one certified compliance specialist.  Kazakhstan’s National Bank, the Association of Financiers of Kazakhstan, and the FIU, jointly with international partners, conduct AML/CFT conferences for private sector representatives on a regular basis.   Kenya   OVERVIEW  Kenya remains vulnerable to money laundering, financial fraud, and terrorism financing.  It is the financial hub of East Africa and pioneered mobile banking in the region.  Money laundering occurs in the formal and informal sectors, deriving from domestic and foreign criminal operations.  Criminal activities include transnational organized crime, cybercrime, corruption, smuggling, trade invoice manipulation, trade in illegal timber and charcoal, wildlife trafficking, and illicit trade in drugs and counterfeit goods, including sugar and other agricultural products.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  124  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Financial institutions engage in currency transactions connected to international narcotics trafficking, involving significant amounts of U.S. currency derived from illegal sales in the United States and Kenya.   Unregulated networks of hawaladars and other unlicensed remittance systems facilitate cash-based, unreported transfers.  Foreign nationals, including refugees and ethnic Somali residents, primarily use the hawala system to transmit remittances internationally.  Diaspora remittances to Kenya totaled $1.78 billion between January and August 2020.  DNFBPs are a likely vehicle for money laundering that is beyond the current capacity of the host government to address.  Banking systems, wire services, and mobile money platforms are widely available and frequently used in Kenya.  Kenya’s digital financial services and platforms are vulnerable to money laundering.  Mobile moneylenders are not regulated despite widespread use of mobile lending applications.  Most of Kenya’s mobile money agents use Safaricom’s M-Pesa system.  M-Shwari, a mobile lender, has over 12 million registered subscribers, with 8 million active users.  Kenya is a transit point for the region and international traffickers of narcotics, persons, wildlife, timber, charcoal, and minerals.  TBML continues to be a problem.  Its proximity to Somalia makes it attractive for laundering of piracy-related proceeds, as well as other funds from unregulated Somali sectors, including the khat and charcoal trades.  Goods reported as transiting Kenya are not subject to customs duties, but authorities acknowledge many such goods are actually sold in Kenya.  Trade is often used to offset transactions in regional hawala networks.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Proceeds of Crime and Anti-Money Laundering Act (POCAMLA), as amended, provides a comprehensive AML framework.  Covered entities reporting to the Financial Reporting Center (FRC), Kenya’s FIU, are subject to KYC and STR rules and have EDD procedures in place for PEPs.      The Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) has adopted a risk-based AML/CFT regulatory framework.  Commercial banks are expected to record and report all transactions above approximately $10,000; CBK has imposed fines on violators.    The United States and Kenya do not have a bilateral MLAT; however, relevant multilateral law enforcement conventions with mutual legal assistance provisions and domestic laws allow the United States and Kenya to make and receive requests for assistance.  Kenya is a member of ESAAMLG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/j-m/kenya/documents/mutualevaluationofkenya.html.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  125  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   An automated system would improve the FRC’s efficiency and ability to analyze STRs.  Although the FRC receives STRs from some MVTS providers, this sector presents an AML compliance challenge.  More broadly, the host government is not well equipped or trained to combat increasingly complex cyber tools for money laundering, including virtual currency.  Kenya does not recognize virtual currency as legal tender, so AML requirements have not addressed digital asset risks.  CBK and the Capital Markets Authority issued circulars warning banks and the public not to engage in digital asset trades, but a gap remains in formulating a framework to address digital asset threats.  Tracking and investigating suspicious transactions within the mobile money sector remain difficult.  Lack of oversight and enforcement in this sector, coupled with inadequate reporting, increases the risk of abuse.  Kenya’s National Assembly has thus far failed to pass amendments to the POCAMLA to extend reporting requirements to lawyers, notaries, and other independent legal professionals.  To demand bank records or seize an account, police must obtain a court order by presenting evidence linking the deposits to a criminal violation.  Confidentiality of this process is not well maintained, allowing account holders to be tipped off and providing an opportunity to move assets.  Despite progress, Kenya needs to strengthen implementation of good governance and anticorruption measures and improve its AML/CFT regime.  Bureaucratic, logistical, and capacity impediments may hinder the investigation and prosecution of financial crimes.  Kenya’s FIU is not a member of the Egmont Group.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Kenya’s constitution requires public officials to seek approval from the Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (EACC) before the officials can open a foreign bank account.  EACC has had some success in recent years with corruption investigations leading to successful prosecutions and asset seizures, but the agency requires technological support and training to grapple with more complicated money laundering operations.  The government should allocate increased resources to building institutional capacity and investigative capacity within FRC, EACC, and other enforcement agencies.   Kyrgyz Republic  OVERVIEW  The Kyrgyz Republic is not a regional financial center, but a large shadow economy, corruption, organized crime, and narcotics trafficking make the country vulnerable to financial crimes.  Over the past five years, remittance transfers from migrant workers have compromised around 30 \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  126  percent of GDP.  A significant portion of remittances enter the Kyrgyz Republic through informal channels or are hand-carried from abroad.  The Kyrgyz Republic is recognized as a reliable partner for foreign banks and other financial institutions, although no U.S. commercial banks operate in the Kyrgyz Republic or conduct correspondent banking with local banks.  Over the last two years, the government passed new AML and criminal legislation to match international standards.  The Kyrgyz Republic has shown little progress in some areas, but challenges in implementation suggests they are neither backsliding nor making progress in the fight against money laundering.      VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Absent exact figures, it appears narcotics trafficking is the main income source for organized crime.  The country sits along the northern transit route from Afghanistan to Russia and beyond, particularly to Europe.  Since the Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the Eurasian Economic Union, smuggled narcotics can travel from the Kyrgyz Republic to the Polish border without undergoing a customs check.  The smuggling of consumer goods, tax and tariff evasion, and official corruption continue to serve as major sources of criminal proceeds.  Money laundering also occurs through trade-based fraud, bulk-cash couriers, and informal and unregulated value transfer systems.  Weak political will, resource constraints, inefficient financial systems, competition for resources among state agencies tackling money laundering, and corruption serve to stifle efforts to effectively combat money laundering.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Kyrgyz Republic has a 2018 AML law with comprehensive KYC, CDD, and STR requirements covering financial and non-financial entities.  The AML law also requires due diligence for PEPs, including foreign citizens, Kyrgyz citizens, and members of international organizations.  Kyrgyz legislation includes criminal corporate liability and criminal liability for illicit enrichment, as well as the institution of plea bargaining, but Kyrgyz authorities require additional time and increased capacity to properly implement these provisions.  While the Kyrgyz Republic conducted a money laundering NRA, there remains a limited understanding of money laundering risks.    In 2020, due to the pandemic the State Financial Intelligence Service (SFIS), the Kyrgyz FIU, did not sign any international cooperation agreements.  The Kyrgyz Republic and the United States do not have a records exchange mechanism in place currently, but both parties are parties to multilateral legal instruments that can be used to facilitate cooperation.    The Kyrgyz Republic is a member of the EAG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/j-m/kyrgyzstan/documents/mer-kyrgyzstan-2018.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  The Kyrgyz Republic continues to bring its legislation into compliance with international \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  127  standards.  The Kyrgyz Republic passed an anticorruption strategy for 2021-2024, which includes plans to better repatriate stolen assets.  The Kyrgyz Republic substantially addressed its established action plan by adequately criminalizing money laundering and terrorism financing; strengthening CDD requirements; establishing an adequate legal framework for identifying, tracing, and freezing terrorist assets; and instituting adequate measures for the confiscation of funds related to money laundering.  While the asset confiscation framework is expansive in addressing the shortcomings identified by international experts, the Kyrgyz Republic has until 2024 to implement any changes.  The efficacy of these changes remains to be seen.   Despite the legislative changes, significant gaps still exist in enforcement and implementation.  The SFIS is the main state agency responsible for AML/CFT enforcement. SFIS is not an investigative agency and therefore lacks cooperation and information sharing with other law enforcement agencies.  Both government and private institutions lack personnel, training, and capacity to enforce the law.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The Kyrgyz Republic has AML and criminal legislation in accordance with international standards.  The Kyrgyz Republic continues legislative implementation.   In 2020, the SFIS sent 81 financial investigative requests (66 on money laundering and 15 on terrorism and extremism financing) to the relevant law enforcement bodies.  Per the SFIS’ report, around $2 million was seized and returned to the state budget and around $1.8 million was frozen, pending further investigation.  There is no other available data on prosecutions and convictions.    Although the Kyrgyz Republic makes efforts to strengthen AML/CFT legislation, law enforcement capacity remains weak.  Additionally, interagency cooperation is poor and law enforcement agencies struggle to communicate effectively.    Laos   OVERVIEW      Laos, a cash-based economy with limited capacity in the legal, regulatory, and law enforcement sectors, remains vulnerable to criminal networks.  With support from a small number of donors and technical assistance providers, Laos has sought to address gaps in its AML/CFT regime.  The Lao government needs to make significant progress in the area of operational effectiveness.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES     Laos shares over 3,100 miles of border with five other countries.  The borders of Laos are notoriously porous, and the country is a key trafficking route for transnational criminal organizations involved in gaming and drug, human, and wildlife trafficking.  Corruption also presents significant vulnerabilities for Laos’s AML regime; high-value purchases, including \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  128  land, real estate, and luxury vehicles, are routinely made with cash.  Laos completed an NRA in 2018, which identified seven areas vulnerable to money laundering, but corruption was not among them.    Although gaming is illegal for Lao nationals, casinos operating in special economic zones serve foreign, mainly Chinese, tourists visiting Laos.  According to the Anti-Money Laundering Intelligence Office (AMLIO), the Lao FIU, Laos is currently drafting a Decree on Casino and Gaming Operations to provide for supervision of casinos and gaming.  Until this decree is passed and implemented, however, casinos pose a significant risk because government supervision appears to be minimal, including a lack of licensing requirements and no obvious enforcement mechanisms.  Online gaming exists but is not licensed or supervised and there are no real enforcement mechanisms.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS     Laos issued a new AML/CFT law in 2015 and revised its penal code in 2017 to include a new money laundering offense.  Since then, the government has established the National Coordinating Committee on AML/CFT (NCC) to oversee AML/CFT implementation.  With support from donors, the NCC has issued more than 21 regulations designed to support implementation of the AML/CFT law, including regulations concerning wire transfers, onsite supervisory examinations, and STR requirements.   Laos does not have an extradition or mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States, though Laos is a party to several multilateral conventions that permit international cooperation.  AMLIO has MOUs with 14 overseas jurisdictions and regularly exchanges information related to individual and corporate accounts under investigation.  AMLIO hopes to become a member of the Egmont Group, but has not yet met the standards for membership.  This is one area in which AMLIO is receiving technical assistance.   Laos is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.apgml.org/members-and-observers/members/member-documents.aspx?m=a6c4a803-0e15-4a43-b03a-700b2a211d2e.      AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES     Despite considerable progress, gaps remain in Laos’s AML/CFT regime.  Known deficiencies include a lack of international cooperation, such as an aversion to passing mutual legal assistance laws and a reluctance to utilize informal platforms for information exchange.  Additional challenges include the lack of an anti-proliferation financing law.  Supervisory agencies have not issued a CDD regulation or guideline addressing the responsibilities of DNFBPs, such as casinos.  The Treasury-designated Kings Romans Casino in the Golden Triangle Special Economic Zone is especially concerning due to links to transnational organized crime.   Awareness and capacity among the state-owned commercial banks also remain weak.  Most of the STRs submitted to the FIU originate from overseas financial institutions operating in Laos, and according to AMLIO, submissions typically only report administrative violations.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  129   Deficiencies include a lack of oversight for MVTS providers and a lack of protection against liability for individuals reporting suspicious activity, although safe harbor regulations have been discussed.  The government amended and issued the Instruction on MVTS report, No. 22/FISD, effective September 26, 2018, directing the Bank of the Lao People’s Democratic Republic and relevant authorities to raise awareness of the risks of AML/CFT and take steps to report suspicious activity within the MVTS sector.  However, it is unclear whether the deficiencies have been cured by the amendments.    Laos has limited asset forfeiture options.  There are several legal provisions – such as those included in customs regulations, anticorruption laws, and drug laws – which allow for asset seizure; however, they are primarily focused on the direct benefit or asset from the offense charged and convicted.  For example, if a drug trafficker is caught in a vehicle, authorities could seize the vehicle as part of the enforcement action but would not go beyond that action.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS     Although there appears to be broad support among Lao ministries for the AML/CFT regime, interagency cooperation needs to be improved.    Financial investigations are not conducted routinely in parallel with the investigation of predicate crimes.  Although five money laundering cases were successfully prosecuted in 2020 – an increase from previous years – a shallow record of AML prosecutions does not demonstrate Laos has made significant progress in effectively and efficiently implementing its laws and regulations.    Liberia   OVERVIEW   The Government of Liberia has made efforts to strengthen its AML regime, but significant challenges remain.  The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) does not robustly enforce AML requirements, largely due to funding constraints.  Interagency coordination has improved, but key stakeholders have not produced actionable financial intelligence, conducted systematic financial investigations, or secured financial crimes convictions.  Financial institutions have limited capacity to detect money laundering, and their financial controls remain weak.  Liberia’s FIU is under-funded and has experienced recurring budget cuts.  The FIU also lacks the institutional and technical capacity and equipment to adequately collect, analyze, and disseminate financial intelligence.  Liberia remains a cash-based economy with weak border controls and endemic corruption, leaving the country vulnerable to illicit activities.  The government should enhance CBL oversight authority and consistently provide adequate resources to the FIU.  Liberia should continue to work with international partners to ensure its AML laws, regulations, and policies meet international standards and are enforced.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  131  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Smuggled goods enter Liberia through numerous crossing points.  The 2020 COVID-19 outbreak resulted in closures of land border crossings, which limited but did not stop smuggling.  Illicit transactions are facilitated by Liberia’s cash-based economy, in which both Liberian and U.S. dollars are recognized as legal tender.  Money exchange operations are poorly controlled, and there are numerous unlicensed foreign exchange enterprises and unregulated entities with opaque activities.  Several money exchange entities facilitate what appear to be unregulated or unlicensed money transfers and serve as alternative remittance channels.  Artisanal diamond and gold mines are largely unregulated and difficult to monitor, providing opportunities for illicit financial transactions.  The Liberia National Police, Liberia Drug Enforcement Agency, and National Security Agency can investigate financial crimes but are not effective in pursuing investigations and prosecutions.  Liberia does not have functional FTZs.  While the National Lottery Authority exercises limited oversight of the country’s two registered casinos, as well as lotteries, it has not proven capable of regulating the gaming industry.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Liberian laws against money laundering and economic sabotage include the Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing Act of 2012, the New Penal Law, Title 26 of the Liberian Code of Law Revised, the Liberia Anti-Terrorism Act of 2017, the Targeted Sanctions Against Terrorists Act of 2017, and the Special Criminal Procedures for Offenses Involving Terrorists Act of 2017.  Following a revision of the FIU Act of 2012, which establishes and governs the FIU, the entity has submitted a draft Financial Intelligence Agency bill to President Weah for his review.  If passed into law by the legislature, that bill would create a Financial Intelligence Agency to replace the existing FIU.  In September 2020, the FIU held a stakeholders’ validation workshop to validate the final phase of the money laundering/terrorist financing NRA.  The NRA is meant to identify, assess, and understand money laundering/terrorist financing risks and apply risk-based approaches toward preventing or mitigating these activities in Liberia.  Liberia has a bilateral extradition treaty with the United States.  Liberia and the United States do not have an MLAT; however, Liberia is a party to several multilateral conventions that permit international law enforcement cooperation.    Liberia is a member of the GIABA, a FATF-style regional body.  Liberia’s most recent MER is available at:  https://www.giaba.org/reports/mutual-evaluation/Liberia.html.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Key challenges to developing a robust AML regime include limited capacity to enforce regulations, investigate financial crimes and illicit money flows, and conduct successful \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  132  prosecutions and asset recovery.  Before October 2020, the FIU received 38 STRs, disseminated three to law enforcement officials and the judiciary, and placed seven on full monitoring.  There were no prosecutions or convictions for money laundering in the last year.  International donors supported the Liberian government to build capacity and improve the operational effectiveness of the FIU to identify, analyze, and disseminate financial intelligence data.  International partners also assisted the CBL to expand onsite examination of domestic banks and non-bank financial institutions and mentored enforcement authorities to develop financial crime cases.  However, Liberia’s lack of prioritization of the FIU is evidenced by three years of low budget allocations and consistent challenges accessing the funds allocated to the FIU.  The Liberian FIU has applied for Egmont Group membership and is awaiting feedback.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   The CBL conducts AML/CFT inspections of commercial banks, as well as offsite surveillance and supervision of commercial banks’ implementation of KYC and CDD guidelines.  However, it has limited technical capacity to systematically monitor and enforce compliance.  During 2020, the CBL adopted more robust monitoring and surveillance procedures to ensure that financial institutions adhere to the laws, regulations, and guidelines to counter money laundering and terrorist financing.  The FIU shares its regulations and guidance on STRs and CTRs, as well as information on cross-border transfers of cash, with other agencies, such as the Liberia Revenue Authority, the Liberia National Police, and the Liberia Immigration Services.  The FIU is nearing completion of an electronic reporting platform to allow commercial banks to upload STRs and CTRs.  Money laundering investigations are hampered by limited capacity, political interference, corruption, lack of financial transparency, inadequate record-keeping, and weak judicial institutions.    Macau  OVERVIEW  Macau, a Special Administrative Region (SAR) of the People’s Republic of China, is not a significant regional financial center.  Its financial system, which mostly services a local population, includes offshore financial businesses such as credit institutions, insurers, underwriters, and trust management companies.  The offshore sector is subject to supervisory requirements similar to those of domestic institutions and to oversight by the Monetary Authority of Macau.  Law No. 15/2018, which entered into force in December 2018, stipulates that from January 2021 the offshore regime will be permanently terminated.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  133  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   With gaming revenues of $33.6 billion for 2019 (an 11 percent drop from 2018), Macau is still the world’s largest gaming market by revenue.  The gaming sector caters to three main customer types – premium players, junket players, and mass gaming players – and relies heavily on junket operators, i.e., middlemen who extend credit to gamblers and are responsible for collecting debts and for the supply of wealthy gamblers, who are mostly from mainland China.  In addition to attracting those seeking anonymity or alternatives to China’s currency movement restrictions, junket operators are also popular among casinos unable to collect gaming debts in mainland China, where gaming is illegal.  Asian organized crime groups also are active in the gaming services and involved in illegal activities such as drug trafficking.  This mingling of licit and illicit activities, together with the anonymity gained through using a junket operator in the transfer and commingling of funds, and the absence of currency and exchange controls present vulnerabilities for money laundering.   In July, the Financial Intelligence Office (GIF), Macau’s FIU, released its latest STR report for the first half of 2020.  Out of 947 STRs received by GIF, 35.1 percent were from the financial sector and 49 percent were from the gaming sector.  This supports government officials’ stance that the primary sources of laundered funds, derived from local and overseas criminal activity, are gaming-related crimes, property offenses, and fraud.  Macau is likely a transit point and an end destination for such funds.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Macau authorities continue their efforts to develop an AML framework that meets international standards.  Macau has an interagency AML/CFT working group, which coordinates responses to identified risks.  Macau’s primary AML/CFT legislation dates to 2006.  The laws impose AML/CFT requirements on all financial institutions, including currency exchangers, money transmitters, casinos, pawnshops, and property agents.  The laws postulate STR requirements for solicitors, accountants, and dealers in precious metals, gems, luxury vehicles, and other high value goods.  Later amendments widen the scope of identifiable criminal offenses to include smuggling and drug trafficking and strengthen CDD measures to identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners.  Macau’s casino regulator, the Gaming Inspection and Coordination Bureau (DICJ), requires gaming and junket operators to carry out CDD and, when relevant, EDD, and to keep records of large and/or suspicious transactions.  Gaming supervisors have a good understanding of the risks posed by junket operators and have taken a more stringent approach toward licensing and the supervision of junket promoters, which are subject to enforceable AML requirements.  The number of licensed junket promoters continues to decrease, from 235 in 2013 to 95 in 2020.  Travelers entering or leaving Macau with cash or other negotiable monetary instruments valued at approximately $15,000 or more are required by law to sign and submit a declaration form to the Macau Customs Service.  Macau is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  134  at:  http://www.apgml.org/members-and-observers/members/member-documents.aspx?m=fded343f-c299-4409-9cfc-0a97d89b6485.      AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Gaming entities are subject to threshold reporting for transactions over approximately $62,700 (500,000 pataca) under the supplementary guidelines of the DICJ.  Macau should lower the large transaction report threshold for casinos to $3,000 to bring it in line with international standards.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The government should continue to strengthen interagency coordination to prevent money laundering in the gaming industry, especially by continuing to encourage junket operators to strengthen their AML controls and develop their compliance programs.  Macau should strengthen its ability to support international AML investigations and recovery of assets by conducting stricter CDD compliance, including background checks on junket operators, and assessing the effectiveness of internal AML controls implemented by junket operators.  Issues to consider include whether junket operators have an established code of conduct, a stated ethical standard, and a procedure in place to protect whistleblowers.  There are signs that the Macau government is starting to take AML cases more seriously.  In 2019, Macau prosecuted over 20 percent of filed AML cases (10 out of 48), a significant improvement from its historical prosecutorial rate of one to five percent.    In 2019, STRs received from the gaming sector accounted for 65 percent of the 2,941 reports filed.  A total of 48 reports involving possible money laundering offenses were sent to the Public Prosecutions Office, and charges were put forward in 10 cases.   The 1988 UN Drug Convention was extended to Macau in 1999, the UNCAC in 2003, and UNTOC in 2006.     Malaysia   OVERVIEW  Malaysia is a highly open, upper middle-income economy with exposure to a range of money laundering threats.  The country’s porous land and sea borders, visa-free entry policy for nationals from over 160 countries, strategic geographic position, and well-developed financial system increase its vulnerability to domestic and transnational criminal activity, including fraud, corruption, drug trafficking, wildlife trafficking, smuggling, tax crimes, and terrorism finance.  Malaysia has largely up-to-date AML laws and policies and effective monitoring and enforcement capabilities.  The country continues to demonstrate progress toward improving AML enforcement by investigating and prosecuting money laundering cases, including a $3.9 billion settlement in July related to the 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB) scandal.  A key area for development is the prosecution of foreign-sourced crimes. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  135  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Malaysia has a highly open economy and is used as a transit country to move drugs globally.  Drug trafficking by Chinese, Iranian, and Nigerian organizations is a significant source of illegal proceeds.  Malaysia is also a source, destination, and transit country for wildlife trafficking, serving as a nexus for illegal wildlife products destined for China, Vietnam, and other countries, with some contraband (e.g., ivory) used as currency by trafficking networks.  Money laundering methods used for terrorist financing include cash couriers, funds skimmed from charities, gold and gem smuggling, and front companies and businesses.  Illicit proceeds are also generated by fraud, criminal breach of trust, illegal gaming, credit card fraud, counterfeiting, robbery, forgery, human trafficking, smuggling, and extortion.  Malaysia has an offshore financial sector on the island of Labuan, which is subject to the same AML laws as the onshore financial sector.  The Labuan International Business and Financial Center (IBFC) has existed for 30 years and is home to over 6,000 companies operating in insurance, banking, fintech, trade, and related sectors.  The financial institutions operating in Labuan include both domestic and foreign banks and insurers.  As of 2018 there were 55 operating banks holding $55 billion in assets.  The Labuan Financial Services Authority, established in 1996 under the Labuan Financial Services Authority Act, administers the Labuan IBFC.  Offshore companies must be established through a trust company.    Malaysia maintains 21 free commercial zones and 17 free industrial zones and launched a digital FTZ with China in 2017.  The cash and informal economies and unauthorized MSBs continue to pose significant vulnerabilities.  Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM), Malaysia’s central bank and competent authority, continues to take enforcement actions against unauthorized MSBs.  The ministry of finance licenses and regulates the activity of casinos.  BNM periodically assesses Malaysia’s sole licensed casino for AML compliance.  Malaysia’s NRA includes the Islamic financial sector, which is prominent in Malaysia and subject to the same AML legal and regulatory regime as the conventional financial sector.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Malaysia passed the Anti-Money Laundering, Anti-Terrorism Financing and Proceeds of Unlawful Activities Act (AMLA) in 2001 and has comprehensive CDD and STR regulations.  BNM issued its Policy Document on Anti-Money Laundering, Countering Financing of Terrorism and Targeted Financial Sanctions for Financial Institutions, Designated Non-Financial Businesses and Professions and Non-Bank Financial Institutions in December 2019, which took effect on January 1, 2020.  The policy document supersedes previous guidance last issued in 2013.  In September 2020, BNM published further guidelines on the Verification of Customer Identity for CDD and Beneficial Ownership as a supplement to the policy document. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  136   Malaysia is a member of the FATF and the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/Mutual-Evaluation-Report-Malaysia-2015.pdf.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Malaysia has a high degree of technical compliance with international AML standards, but deficiencies remain.  Malaysia should continue its efforts to target effectively high-risk offenses and foreign-sourced crimes.  Malaysia has a national action plan focusing on these areas.  Malaysia has traditionally pursued other measures, especially forfeiture, in place of money laundering prosecutions.  The handling and effective disposal of seized assets remains a challenge for authorities.  The establishment of the National Anti-Financial Crime Centre in 2019 should help address this issue.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The government, with foreign assistance, has taken action to prosecute several former government officials involved in misappropriations from the state-owned development fund 1MDB.  In July 2020, Malaysia’s former prime minister was found guilty on three counts of money laundering in connection to the 1MDB scandal and sentenced to 12 years in jail. In 2019, Malaysia prosecuted 70 cases under AMLA.  This includes drug-related cases as well as fraud, corruption, and other crimes.   Mexico   OVERVIEW  Illicit actors launder billions of dollars of drug trafficking proceeds through the Mexican financial system annually.  Corruption, bulk cash smuggling, extortion, fuel theft, fraud, human smuggling, and trafficking in persons and firearms serve as sources of additional funds laundered through Mexico.  Mexican authorities have had some success investigating and blocking accounts of suspected money launderers but have shown limited progress in successfully prosecuting money laundering and other financial crimes.  Two supreme court rulings in 2017 continue to complicate Mexico’s ability to counter illicit financial activities.      Money laundering offenses continue as the government struggles to prosecute financial crimes and seize and forfeit assets.  To increase the number of financial crime convictions, the government needs to combat corruption and improve investigative and prosecutorial capacity.  New legislation passed in 2019 expands predicate offenses and makes asset forfeiture proceedings independent from any related criminal proceeding, but legal challenges to the law have hindered the Federal Prosecutor General’s (FGR) office’s ability to obtain a conviction under the legislation.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  137   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Illicit drug proceeds leaving the United States are the principal sources of funds laundered through the Mexican financial system.  Mexican transnational criminal organizations launder funds using a variety of methods.  TBML involves the use of dollar-denominated illicit proceeds to purchase retail items or services for export to and re-sale in Mexico or the United States.  In some cases, the TBML activity includes falsifying invoices and misrepresenting the value of goods or services.  President Lopez Obrador issued an executive order in 2019 strengthening penalties for issuing these types of fraudulent tax invoices, often associated with TBML.      Illicit actors in Mexico invest in traditional financial assets as well as real assets, such as property and businesses.  Money laundering through the luxury real estate sector remains a concern, especially as a vehicle for laundering the proceeds of public corruption.  Two popular laundering methods include structuring cash deposits and using funnel accounts.  Chinese money laundering organizations continue to conduct “mirror transactions” more efficiently and at a lower cost than traditional Mexican launderers, creating a great reliance on these entities over the Mexican launderers.  Narcotics proceeds are also laundered through unlicensed exchange houses.  Mexico’s main banking regulator, the National Banking and Securities Commission (CNBV), has a special unit to investigate unlicensed exchange houses.         Mexican authorities have increasingly been monitoring the potential for criminal exploitation of financial technology, including virtual currencies.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Mexican AML law criminalizes money laundering at the state and federal level.  In addition, CDD rules cover most financial sector entities, including financial technology institutions (FTIs).  The CNBV regulates FTIs involved in electronic payments, exchanges of virtual assets, and cryptocurrencies.  Critics argue the FTI law’s secondary regulations allow for additional money laundering vulnerabilities because they go too far in liberalizing financial markets for FTIs.    Mexico is a member of both the FATF and the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Mexico’s most recent MER is available at:  www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/MER-Mexico-2018.pdf.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   In 2017, the supreme court ruled the Financial Intelligence Unit’s (UIF) freezing of accounts violates constitutional protections and due process rights.  UIF can still freeze accounts when presented with an international request for legal assistance.  Another 2017 decision curbed FGR’s ability to present financial records during court proceedings, allowing as admissible only records obtained by court order.  In response to the rulings, several individuals and entities filed court cases to have their accounts unfrozen and cases dismissed.  Prosecutors and law enforcement authorities have struggled to investigate and prosecute financial crimes, and these rulings may result in additional case dismissals.  The Mexican congress is currently debating a \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  138  legislative proposal to allow the UIF to add individuals to the blocked persons’ list and block their assets if it deems there are sufficient indicators of money laundering.       ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Although authorities recognize the abuse of certain sectors by money launderers, law enforcement responses are limited by corruption and lack of capacity.  The government has not yet provided the number of convictions for 2019.  The money laundering unit of the organized crime division of FGR informally reported it obtained 10 money laundering convictions in 2019, compared to 6 convictions in 2018, according to open reporting.  The file tracking system of Mexico’s Federal Judiciary recorded six cases that resulted in guilty pleas and five that went to trial in 2019.  The data does not indicate whether the trials resulted in convictions.  The relative lack of convictions in money laundering cases is representative of Mexico’s limited capacity to prosecute crimes generally.    In August 2019, the president signed into law non-conviction-based asset forfeiture legislation to enable prosecutors and law enforcement agencies to more aggressively seize illicit assets, including instrumentalities of crimes.  The new law also adds corruption and money laundering as predicate offenses.  Subsequently, FGR created a new specialized asset forfeiture unit to pursue all federal forfeiture actions.  In August 2020, the FGR filed its first three federal asset forfeiture complaints.  The complaints were filed before Mexico’s lone federal asset forfeiture judge (there are pending plans to add more forfeiture judges) and have yet to be scheduled for an initial hearing.  There are additional asset forfeiture judges at the state level who are considering cases throughout the country, but no forfeiture matter has yet been resolved under the new law.      Morocco   OVERVIEW  Morocco is making progress in strengthening its AML regime through coordination and capacity building.  Vulnerabilities stem from the prevalence of cash-based transactions, geographic location, established trafficking networks, a high volume of remittances, and public corruption.  Morocco serves as an integration point into the legitimate economy for illicit drug money, with an estimated hundreds of millions of dollars laundered through Morocco annually.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Morocco’s informal, cash-based economy is estimated to equal 20-30 percent of GDP.  Only 61 percent of Moroccans have a bank account, according to the Moroccan central bank (BAM), and even among holders of bank accounts, cash is often preferred.  A mobile banking initiative was launched in 2018 to facilitate access to banking services and to encourage electronic (and more easily traceable) payments, but adoption has been slow, with fewer than 900,000 “m-wallets” opened through 2019.  Improvements to interoperability were made in 2020 to increase adoption by merchants. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  139  Morocco’s geographic location as a gateway between Europe and Africa makes it a conduit for smuggling, drug trafficking, human trafficking, and clandestine migration.  A law to combat trafficking in persons deters human trafficking and money laundering by broadly defining trafficking to include anyone who gives or receives payments or benefits related to trafficking and imposing heavy sentences on offenders.  The export of Moroccan-grown cannabis (especially hashish) and, increasingly, the trafficking of cocaine from Latin America to Europe via Morocco, generate significant illicit profits.  Real estate, jewelry, and vehicle purchases are used to launder drug proceeds.   Money transfer services present a vulnerability due to their volume.  Annual remittance transfers rose to $6.7 billion in 2019, accounting for 5.6 percent of GDP.  The majority of transfers originate in Europe.  The Financial Intelligence Processing Unit (UTRF), the Moroccan FIU, requires transfer operators to collect identification information on both senders and recipients.  Unregulated hawalas and bulk cash smugglers are also used to move illicit funds internationally.  Morocco’s seven FTZs are regulated by an interagency commission.  The FTZs allow customs exemptions for goods manufactured in the zones for export abroad.  Six offshore banks operate in the Tangier FTZ, and all are affiliates of local banks and operate with consolidated controls.  UTRF has reported suspicions of money laundering activity through the Tangier FTZ.  International casinos with in-house accounts are a vehicle through which money may enter and exit Morocco without currency control restrictions.  There are several multinational casinos in Morocco, and the extent to which this transfer method is used to launder illicit proceeds is unknown.  Casinos are supervised by UTRF, but generally file no STRs.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Morocco has key AML laws and regulations in place, including CDD programs and STR procedures, and in 2019 brought its PEP requirements in line with international standards.  High-risk customers/transactions are scrutinized under Morocco’s AML law and Central Bank Circular No. 2/G/2012.  In 2019, Morocco adopted a national risk assessment and institutionalized a national committee to coordinate the country’s AML strategy.  Morocco has an MLAT with the United States but does not have a bilateral extradition treaty with the United States.  Morocco is a party to several multilateral law enforcement conventions that also permit mutual legal assistance with the United States.  Morocco is a member of the MENAFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.menafatf.org/information-center/menafatf-publications/anti-money-laundering-and-counter-terrorist-financing.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  140  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  International experts have noted a number of areas for improvement in Morocco’s AML/CFT regime, including the need for greater national coordination; the lack of a declaration system for cross-border currency transportation reporting; and legal, regulatory, and policy issues impeding the effective implementation of supervisory and criminal enforcement actions.  Morocco has been seeking to address these concerns through a variety of reforms.  Related legislation remains stalled in Parliament.  Money laundering is classified as a misdemeanor in Morocco.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Morocco continues to work closely with international partners.  The government has implemented applicable multilateral agreements and voluntarily initiated exchanges with private sector partners to address key vulnerabilities.  Morocco has increased the number of law enforcement assets dedicated to money laundering investigations, resulting in an increase in criminal cases involving money laundering from 30 in 2019 to 193 in 2020.  There were only eight convictions for money laundering in the 10 years leading up to 2018, while 62 convictions have been achieved in 2019 and 2020, combined.  These cases involve relatively simple money laundering, integrating drug proceeds into buildings and businesses, and do not include more complex cases involving professional money launderers or organized crime; officials claim complex money laundering and organized crime do not exist in Morocco.     Mozambique  OVERVIEW  Money laundering in Mozambique is driven by misappropriation of state funds, kidnappings, human trafficking, narcotics trafficking, wildlife trafficking, and terrorism.  With a long, largely unpatrolled coastline, porous land borders, and limited rural law enforcement presence, Mozambique is a major corridor for illicit goods including hardwoods, gemstones, wildlife products, and narcotics.  Narcotics are typically trafficked through Mozambique to other African nations and then on to further destinations, such as Europe and the United States.   In 2020, the Government of Mozambique took steps to address money laundering through the adoption of a new asset recovery bill as well as a unique account number for an individual to use in banks nationwide.  However, public prosecutors, judges, and police lack the technical capacity and resources to successfully combat money laundering.  Mozambique would also benefit from better collaboration among AML/CFT enforcement institutions.    From 2013-2014, a group of senior Mozambican officials, including the former finance minister, secretly negotiated over $2 billion in loans, much of which went to illegal bribes and other illicit \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  141  payments to the government officials, bankers, and businesspeople involved in the scheme.  While 19 individuals face charges in Mozambique, including the son of a former president and the former director of Mozambique’s intelligence service, for their alleged roles in the hidden debt scandal, neither the Attorney General (PGR) nor Administrative Court have proceeded with trials.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   South Asian, East Asian, and Latin American criminal syndicates play a prominent role in illicit activities such as poaching, illegal logging, and trafficking narcotics, gemstones, and animal products.  Authorities believe proceeds from these activities may be financing violent extremists in northern Mozambique.  Law enforcement sources estimate at least 80 percent of all heroin entering Europe or the United States via Africa passes through Mozambique.  Money laundering is conducted primarily through foreign currency exchange houses, cash smugglers, and hawala brokers.  The real estate sector, because of the lack of a regulatory body, is also susceptible to money laundering.  Black markets for smuggled goods and informal financial services are widespread, dwarfing the formal sector in most parts of the country.  Given the lax control over mobile and electronic payments, mobile systems are increasingly used to facilitate illicit networks, including terrorists operating in northern Mozambique.  There are three FTZs in Mozambique, but there is no evidence they are tied to money laundering.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Law 14/2013 and decree regulation 66/2014 provide tools to combat money laundering and terrorism financing in Mozambique.  The law allows the government to freeze terrorist assets and enter into MLATs for terrorism finance cases.  The law also criminalizes terrorist financing, specifies evidence collection procedures, and allows for the seizure of documents.  Mozambique has KYC provisions, and STRs are analyzed and flagged by the financial intelligence unit (GIFIM—Portuguese acronym) and distributed to relevant investigative bodies.  Regulations also require EDD for PEPs.  The Bank of Mozambique places AML obligations on local banks.    In November 2020, the government adopted a new asset recovery law that will improve coordination among government agencies and enhance the country’s ability to prosecute corruption and recover stolen assets.  In December 2020, the PGR created a new asset recovery office in line with the new legislation.    In September 2020, the Bank of Mozambique announced plans for a unique bank identification number (UBIN) to combat money laundering and terrorist financing by making it easier for the government to track accounts across multiple financial institutions.  Technical discussions between the Bank of Mozambique and commercial banks on implementation are now underway and the government expects the UBIN system to be operational by early 2021.    Mozambique is a member of the ESAAMLG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.esaamlg.org/index.php/Countries/readmore_members/Mozambique. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  142  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Mozambique has made steady progress establishing a legal framework that supports money laundering investigations, but implementing agencies need more robust human, financial, and technical resources to effectively investigate and prosecute money laundering and financial crimes.  The GIFIM has expressed interest in joining the Egmont Group and is awaiting Council of Ministers’ approval to apply for membership.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Mozambique has made progress in enforcing AML laws and implementing regulations.  According to the most recent available data, in 2019, the PGR received 48 reports of suspicious transactions which led to 32 criminal cases.  The PGR has noted the need for better technology and specialized human resources to analyze data and accounting information, which often requires collaboration among multiple agencies and international jurisdictions.     The United States and Mozambique are establishing records-exchange procedures.  The U.S. DEA opened an office in Mozambique in 2017 and continues to deepen information sharing on money laundering and narcotics cases with Mozambican law enforcement partners.  Mozambique is a member of the Asset Recovery Inter-Agency Network for Southern Africa, which supports information sharing to identify, track, and seize criminal assets.    Netherlands   OVERVIEW  The Netherlands is a major trade and financial center and, consequently, an attractive venue for money laundering.  The Netherlands is generally making progress addressing money laundering vulnerabilities.       Six islands in the Caribbean fall under the jurisdiction of the Kingdom of the Netherlands:  Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba are special municipalities of the Netherlands; and Aruba, Curacao, and St. Maarten are semi-autonomous countries within the kingdom.  The Netherlands collaborates to ensure the independence of the courts and to combat cross-border crime and drug trafficking within the kingdom.  The law enforcement MOU between the four Kingdom countries and the United States for joint training activities and sharing of information remains active   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Financial fraud, especially tax evasion and drug trafficking, are believed to generate a considerable portion of domestic money laundering activity.  There are indications of syndicate-\fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  143  type structures involved in organized crime and money laundering.  Law enforcement regularly launches money laundering investigations.  Few border controls exist within the Schengen Area of the EU, although Dutch authorities run special operations in border areas with Germany and Belgium and in the Port of Rotterdam to minimize smuggling.  Informal underground remittance systems operate in the Netherlands.  Criminal networks increasingly operate online and use virtual currencies to facilitate illegal activity.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The Dutch Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU-NL) is an independent, autonomous entity under the Netherlands Police.  The Anti-Money Laundering Center facilitates knowledge-sharing and coordination among government agencies and the private sector.  Seizing and confiscating criminal proceeds is a high priority for Dutch law enforcement.           On June 30, 2019, the government presented a national action plan against money laundering.  The Implementation Act for the Fourth AML Directive took effect on May 21, 2020, extending the directive’s requirements to crypto-service providers.  In September 2020, two additional AML/CFT laws came into force.  The first, the Bank Data Retrieval Portal Act, allows for direct digital access to certain bank data by investigation services.  The second law requires all corporate and other legal entities to list their ultimate beneficial owners in a transparent register, operated by the Chamber of Commerce.   In July 2020, in the wake of several investigations by Dutch authorities, ABN Amro, ING, Rabobank, Triodos, and Volksbank set up the Transaction Monitoring Netherlands (TMNL) initiative to analyze anonymous datasets from the banks to improve their reporting to the FIU-NL on possible money laundering activity.  In recent years, banks have been assessed multi-million dollar fines and, in 2018, a U.S. subsidiary of Rabobank entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. DOJ under which it pled guilty to Bank Secrecy Act and money laundering violations.  In August 2020, press reports indicate the Public Prosecutor investigation into ABN Amro, the third largest bank in the Netherlands (partially owned by the Dutch government) was ongoing.  Press reports also advise German authorities are investigating ABN Amro involvement in tax evasion in Germany.    The government allocated an additional approximately $177.7 million (150 million euros) a year starting in 2022 to fighting organized subversive crime.  In April 2020, the Netherlands launched the Multidisciplinary Intervention Team (MIT), consisting of the police, Public Prosecution Service, Fiscal Information and Investigation Service (FIOD), customs, tax authorities, military police, and defense.  MIT will be a data-driven team of 400 intelligence and digital specialists focused on international and financial supervision working to disrupt criminal networks and their business processes.    Dutch law has comprehensive KYC and STR regulations, which apply to many actors in the financial sector.  Every three years, the government commissions an external assessment of its AML policy.    Law enforcement cooperation between the Netherlands and the United States is good; the \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  144  existing MLAT allows for the exchange of records in connection with narcotics investigations.  However, legal procedures for release of evidence to the United States are cumbersome, and resulting delays pose a threat to the success of U.S. investigations.   The Netherlands is a member of the FATF and is preparing for its next review in 2022.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/n-r/netherlandskingdomof/documents/mutualevaluationreportofthenetherlands.html.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The Netherlands continues to make progress in addressing identified deficiencies.  No significant technical deficiencies in the regulatory regime have been identified.  The magnitude of money laundering, however, remains a concern.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The Netherlands utilizes an “unusual transaction” reporting system.  Designated entities are required to file unusual transaction reports (UTRs) on transactions that could relate to money laundering.  The FIU-NL analyzes UTRs to determine whether they are “suspicious” and forwards them to law enforcement for criminal investigation, at which point they become classified as STRs.  In 2018, the financial institutions submitted around 60,000 UTRs to the FIU, and the FIU declared around 15,000 as suspicious.  Shifting priorities for law enforcement have hindered a sustained effort to improve financial investigations.  Different CTR reporting thresholds apply to various specific transactions, products, and sectors.     Finance Minister Wopke Hoekstra told Parliament on September 22, 2020, that the Netherlands has an enormous problem regarding money laundering, following the report that Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich made around $1.3 billion in questionable payments via Netherlands-based ING Bank and a Polish ING subsidiary.   Nicaragua   OVERVIEW  Nicaragua is not a regional financial center but remains vulnerable to money laundering due to corruption, lack of transparency, drug trafficking, and a large informal sector.  The ongoing socio-political crisis has diverted security forces’ attention from effectively combating illicit activities toward repressive actions against opposition groups, undermining law enforcement performance on AML/CFT.  Regulatory bodies also use their official powers to monitor activities of pro-democracy opposition groups and to conceal illicit government transfers.  The politicization of AML/CFT institutions is a significant concern.  In May 2020, OFAC designated Ivan Acosta, Minister of Finance and Public Credit, for supporting the regime’s human rights violations and corruption.  Acosta is the head of the National Committee on AML/CFT, and his designation is indicative of the AML/CFT committee’s ineffectiveness \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  145  investigating public officials with ties to organized crime.  Also in 2020, OFAC designated Caja Rural National Savings and Credit Cooperative—which reportedly controls an estimated $2.5 billion on behalf of another sanctioned entity—and key government officials for sanctions pursuant to E.O. 13851.  The OFAC designations follow sanctions against companies controlled by President Ortega’s family.  These actions present increased risk of illicit funds leaking into the financial system as the first family seeks to move their wealth into assets that can transit borders.    On October 4, 2018, FinCEN issued an advisory warning U.S. financial institutions of the increasing risk that proceeds of Nicaraguan political corruption may enter or pass through the U.S. financial system.  Concerns persist about the use of AML/CFT laws by the Sandinista National Liberation Front, the government’s ruling political party, primarily as harassment tools against domestic political opposition groups.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Despite a slowdown in economic activities due to COVID-19, Nicaragua remains a transit country for narcotics and vulnerable to money laundering.  TBML in thriving industries, such as gold and beef, constitutes a vulnerability, especially for small-scale operations that rely heavily on cash transactions.  Public corruption persists as a common money laundering typology in sectors such as construction and the procurement of goods and services.    In 2020, there were 188 companies operating under FTZ status in Nicaragua.  There does not appear to be a meaningful nexus between Nicaraguan FTZ companies and AML/CFT issues.  The Central America Four Agreement among El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua allows for visa-free movement of citizens of these countries across their respective borders.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  AML/CFT laws mandate disclosure of beneficial owners.  Financial institutions and DNFBPs follow CDD and SAR requirements.  EDD for PEPs and transactions conducted with high-risk countries are included in the law.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs (MINREX) reported the Financial Analysis Unit (UAF), Nicaragua’s FIU, is developing an NRA on money laundering, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.  The NRA is intended to update the national AML/CFT/counter-proliferation financing (CPF) strategy and action plan.  In January 2020, the UAF issued guidelines to help reporting subjects comply with SAR requirements.  The regime-controlled national assembly amended the Public Registries Law to include the disclosure of beneficial ownership of legal persons and fees related to noncompliance.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  146  The Supreme Court of Justice issued a guideline for lawyers and public notaries on AML/CFT/CPF.  Regulators of banks, accountants, and NPOs issued similar regulations.  Nicaragua is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/content/images/GAFILAT-MER-Nicaragua-2017.pdf.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Although money seizures continue to grow, the government’s unit that manages seized funds is controlled by Ortega loyalists.  The lack of transparency raises concerns about the final destination of seized funds, which can be directed to support repressive activities against political opposition, with facilitation by the Ortega government.  According to MINREX the government seized $16 million in currency through October 13, 2020, the highest amount in eight years.    Many in the legal profession rejected the incorporation of lawyers and public notaries as reporting subjects under Law 976 as amended in 2019 and say the requirement breaches client-lawyer confidentiality.  Limited buy-in from stakeholders hinders the effectiveness of AML/CFT laws.  The lack of governmental impartiality to AML/CFT and regulations is a persistent weakness.  In June 2020, an NGO working on COVID-19 prevention was stripped of legal status and accused of terrorist financing.  Meanwhile, there have been no investigations of individuals and enterprises sanctioned by OFAC for corruption and money laundering.  Nicaragua’s 2014 application for Egmont Group membership remains pending.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Financial sector authorities noted filing a SAR on an OFAC-designated person or other government-aligned individual for potential affiliations with organized crime often generates swift government reactions against the reporting institution, including threats of fines and administrative penalties.  SARs related to enterprises with ties to the Sandinista party are consistently ignored by the regime-controlled UAF.    MINREX reported authorities conducted 39 investigations and 20 prosecutions of money laundering-related cases that implicated 27 persons, obtained 10 convictions, and seized $16 million through October 13, 2020.  The greatest impediment to the implementation and enforcement of Nicaragua’s AML/CFT measures is the politicization of its public institutions.  The government consistently fails to enforce laws against corrupt public officials while its representatives invest considerable time and resources to monitor and fabricate evidence against pro-democracy opposition groups.  This approach takes a toll on AML/CFT efforts, placing Nicaragua at greater risk of organized crime activities.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  147  Nigeria   OVERVIEW  Nigeria is a major drug trans-shipment point and a significant center for financial crime and cyber-crimes.  The Nigeria Financial Intelligence Unit (NFIU) is the national AML/CFT coordinator.  The NFIU’s mandate is to establish the legal, regulatory, and institutional frameworks to proactively and reactively mitigate inherent and imminent risks of money laundering, terrorist financing, and other related financial crimes in the financial and non-financial sectors.  Nigeria, despite having dedicated agencies to fight corruption and belonging to numerous regional and international bodies, continues to record daily money laundering occurrences.  Notwithstanding Nigerian efforts, there are minimal increases in arrests and prosecutions.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Criminal proceeds laundered in Nigeria derive from corruption, foreign drug trafficking, various types of fraud, and other illegal activities.  In Nigeria, money laundering occurs through the misuse of legal persons and companies, real estate investment, wire transfers to offshore entities, deposits into foreign banks, round tripping (reciprocal sales of identical assets), jewelry, bulk cash smuggling, and reselling imported goods, such as luxury or used cars, textiles, and consumer electronics purchased with illicit funds.   Nigeria’s informal economy is responsible for a significant portion of the country’s economic transactions and is largely cash-based.  There are multiple channels to move illicit funds, which include proceeds from the corruption of PEPs, law enforcement officers, and public servants.  Public servants are vulnerable to corruption because of poor social welfare programs and low wages.    Weak oversight and sanctioning protocols embolden cartels to move large amounts of cash within the country and through Nigerian airports.  The Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) issued directives to mitigate cash movements; however, money laundering operators are able to evade law enforcement agencies due to corruption and other systemic weaknesses.      With the introduction and widespread adoption of virtual currency, Nigeria will need to adopt strict rules to ensure this form of currency does not become popular with money laundering organizations inside of Nigeria.  The Securities and Exchange Commission, Nigeria has issued a statement indicating cryptocurrencies will be treated as securities, unless the issuer or sponsor of the assets proves otherwise.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Nigeria has a plethora of laws and regulations for AML, including the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation 2019, which addresses data security and privacy, and the Companies and Allied Matters Act 2020, which is now the primary legislation governing the formation and \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  148  management of companies in Nigeria.  Nigerian law mandates KYC and STR procedures and EDD for both foreign and domestic PEPs.  Legal persons are covered criminally and civilly.     Extradition between Nigeria and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty.  There is also a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty in force between Nigeria and the United States.   Nigeria is a member of the GIABA, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.giaba.org/reports/mutual-evaluation/Nigeria.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Certain AML laws have deficiencies, which can be used as a shield to protect certain categories of people from prosecution.  Legal practitioners are excluded from the definition of DNFBP.  Legal practitioners have sought and been granted court injunctions restraining the CBN from implementing its circular regarding lawyers.  Lawyers file injunctions restraining federal government agencies such as the Special Control Unit against Money Laundering (SCUML), the NFIU, and the Economic and Financial Crimes Commission (EFCC) from seeking to enforce the provisions of Section 5 of the Money Laundering Act in relation to legal practitioners.   The NFIU issued an advisory to stop withdrawal of cash from local government accounts, which was expected to promote accountability and transparency.  However, this advisory was considered an intrusion by the governors of the states who have direct access to these funds.  Due to lack of implementation and enforcement of laws, determining the channels used to move large sums of cash in Nigeria remains difficult.   Despite the laws in place, investigations are still impeded.  Investigative agencies concentrate efforts on cases involving large amounts of money and high-profile cases, which are delayed due to slow judiciary processes.  After the NFIU provides reports to investigative agencies, these agencies are responsible for the pursuit of these cases in a timely manner.   Further deficiencies within government agencies include inadequate human technical capacity and financial resources to monitor and supervise large numbers of DNFBPs.  Compliance officers are exposed to bribes and threats of job loss because there is no protection for individuals who report money laundering/terrorist financing activities of a superior.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Despite the NIFU’s noteworthy efforts to fight corruption, it does not have an enforcement branch to prosecute said cases.  In addition to poor coordination and inadequate funding, Nigerian agencies that enforce AML/CFT measures lack power to administer sanctions.  The SCUML is currently domiciled in the EFCC.       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  149  Pakistan   OVERVIEW  Pakistan’s geographic location and porous borders with Afghanistan, Iran, and China make it vulnerable to narcotics and contraband smuggling.  Pakistan’s 2019 NRA identifies the largest risks associated with illicit finance as corruption and bribery, smuggling, tax fraud, illegal financial transfers, bulk cash smuggling, organized crime, kidnapping for ransom, extortion schemes, and trafficking narcotics, humans, and arms.  Several DNFBP sectors are involved in money laundering using the formal financial system.  The NRA also found many of the illicit proceeds are transferred overseas.  Pakistan’s black market economy, the informal financial system, and a permissive security environment generate substantial demand for money laundering and illicit financial services in Pakistan.    Pakistan continues to work on its 2018 action plan to address AML/CFT deficiencies identified by international experts.  Over the last year, Pakistan passed 15 new laws to address terrorist financing gaps in its AML/CFT regime.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Money laundering occurs in both the formal and informal financial systems.    In fiscal year 2020 (July 2019-June 2020), the diaspora remitted over $23 billion to Pakistan via official channels, up 6.4 percent from the previous year.  The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP), the central bank, attributes some of the increase to a SBP initiative to facilitate formal channel transfers.  COVID-19-related travel restrictions also likely stimulated the use of formal banking channels.    Other common methods for laundering funds include TBML, MSBs, and bulk cash smuggling.  Legitimate traders often use fraudulent invoicing for tax avoidance reasons, but criminals also use cross-border trade as a vehicle for money laundering.    Operation of an unlicensed MSB is illegal but, despite government efforts to curtail their activity, the public’s use of these entities remains prevalent due to poor governmental oversight and limited penalties.  Many MSB transactions are for legitimate purposes due to a lack of access to the formal banking sector (more than 85 percent of Pakistanis do not hold bank accounts).  Significant informal financial activity occurs along the largely unregulated Pakistan-Afghanistan border, and to a lesser extent, Pakistan’s borders with China and Iran.  Border areas see illicit financial activity by terrorist and insurgent groups.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Key AML legislation includes the Anti-Money Laundering Act of 2010 (AMLA), which among other things, establishes Pakistan’s FIU, and the Control of Narcotic Substances Act of 1997.  Pakistan has comprehensive CDD and STR regulations.  Policy reforms have shown an initial uptick in STR volume and improvements in report processing.  The disclosure of beneficial \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  150  owners and EDD for PEPs are required.    Pakistan undertook a major push to enact and amend legislation to address deficiencies in its AML/CFT regime.  Among the 13 relevant new laws adopted in 2020 are:  the Foreign Exchange Regulation (Amendment); the Anti-Money Laundering Act (1st and 2nd Amendments); the National Counterterrorism Authority/NACTA (Amendment); the Anti-Terrorism (1st and 2nd Amendments); the UN Security Council (Amendment); Mutual Legal Assistance (Criminal Matters); Companies Amendment Bill; Limited Liability Partnership Amendment Bill; and the Modaraba Companies (Floatation and Control) (Amendment) Bill.  The United States and Pakistan do not have an MLAT; however, both countries are parties to multilateral conventions that include mutual legal assistance provisions.  Extradition between the United States and Pakistan is governed by the 1931 U.S.-UK Extradition Treaty.  Pakistan does not have a formal mechanism to exchange records on narcotics investigations or court cases and there are no legal mechanisms to allow the United States or other governments to access those records.  Pakistan adopted an amendment to its Mutual Legal Assistance (Criminal Matters) Law in 2020 to establish a central authority within the Ministry of Interior to handle requests for mutual legal assistance.    Pakistan is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  file:///C:/Users/user/Downloads/Pakistan%20MER%202019%20-%20published%20version%20(2).pdf.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Certain categories of DNFBPs, whose transactions are largely cash-based and poorly documented, tend to be involved in money laundering using the formal financial system.  These include lawyers, notaries, accountants, real estate brokers, and jewelry/precious metal traders.  Pakistan’s Securities and Exchange Commission, Federal Board of Revenue, and Ministry of Finance have limited regulatory authority over at-risk sectors such as the Pakistan Post, Central Directorate of National Savings, and the accounting profession.  The real estate profession and the precious stones/metals and jewelry sectors remain unregulated.  The ability of the government and Pakistani Bar Association to police lawyers, legal advisors, and law firms is also limited.  Pakistan has recently clarified and strengthened its regulatory authorities for supervision of these sectors, but it is too soon to evaluate the effectiveness of these new laws and procedures.  The government’s writ in border areas is limited due to remoteness, lack of infrastructure, low population densities, and the fact many in poorer regions depend on the informal sector for their livelihoods, fostering an environment with little rule of law.    The Financial Monitoring Unit, Pakistan’s FIU, is not a member of the Egmont Group.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  In 2020, the government significantly increased monetary penalties and prison sentences for violating the AMLA.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  151  Approximately 51 cases involving the misuse of non-profit organizations, 15 cash smuggling cases, eight cases of extortion, 11 cases of illegally operating an MSB, 10 smuggling cases, 11 narcotics trafficking cases, and one case of kidnapping for ransom were opened in 2020.  The Pakistani government reports 101 convictions in 2020 for terrorism finance violations, which include money laundering offenses reported in 2020.   Panama   OVERVIEW   Panama’s strategic location, dollarized economy, status as a regional financial, trade, and logistics hub, and favorable tax laws render it attractive for exploitation by money launderers.  High-profile money laundering investigations, including the Waked Money Laundering Organization, the “Panama Papers” scandal, former President Ricardo Martinelli’s arrest, extradition, and subsequent acquittal, and scandals involving Brazilian construction giant Odebrecht (that resulted in a U.S. indictment against Martinelli’s two sons) have intensified scrutiny of Panama’s AML vulnerabilities.   The Government of Panama has made some moves to address its agreed-upon action plan.  In March 2019, the government passed the Ultimate Beneficial Ownership Law (UBOL) to create a registry of actual beneficiaries of legal entities.  However, in late 2020, the platform is still in the development phase and has been delayed because of COVID-19.  In January 2020, Panama converted its Intendency of Non-Financial Sectors (SSNF) to a higher-level superintendency.  In August 2020, the government moved responsibility for compliance with international AML standards from the Ministry of the Presidency to the Ministry of Economics and Finance and appointed a new lead administrator.     VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Money laundered in Panama primarily comes from illegal activities committed abroad, including drug trafficking, tax crimes, and smuggling of people and goods.  Panama is a drug transshipment country due to its location along major trafficking routes.  Numerous factors hinder Panama’s fight against money laundering, including lack of capacity to identify bulk cash shipments, inexperience with money laundering investigations and prosecutions, inconsistent enforcement of laws and regulations, corruption, and an under-resourced judicial system whose budget will actually shrink in 2021.    Criminals launder money via bulk cash smuggling and trade at airports and seaports, through shell companies, casinos, cryptocurrencies, and the 12 active FTZs.  This creates the risk that legal entities, such as corporations, private foundations, and trusts, created and registered in Panama can be misused to launder funds, especially from foreign predicate crimes.  Implementation of the UBOL would help mitigate this risk.  Law firms and registered agents are key gatekeepers and will be subject to the new requirements; however, the use of nominee shareholders and directors is still prevalent.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  152  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Panama has improved its compliance with international standards for AML prevention, enforcement, and cooperation.  Panama has comprehensive CDD and STR requirements.  Law 23 criminalizes money laundering and sets AML compliance requirements for entities in 31 sectors.  A proposed amendment would establish more proportional and dissuasive sanctions on financial institutions.  The SSNF oversees the AML compliance of over 12,000 DNFBPs across 11 sectors, including the Colon Free Zone (CFZ), the second largest FTZ in the world.    The United States and Panama have a bilateral MLAT.  Panama is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER can is available at:  https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer-fsrb/MER-GAFILAT-Panama-Jan-2018.pdf.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Tax evasion is a criminal and predicate money laundering offense as described in article 254-A of the penal code.  However, Panama continues to lack sufficient resources, including trained staff, to effectively monitor whether entities, particularly DNFBPs, comply with reporting requirements.  The government needs to enhance training, disseminate guidelines, and organize feedback sessions with reporting entities to improve the quality of STR/CTR reporting, particularly among high-risk sectors.  The FIU needs to demonstrate STRs/CTRs are used to identify leads for illicit finance investigations and its reports are shared more frequently with law enforcement authorities, who in turn need to show the reports are used to investigate and prosecute money laundering crimes.  Panama’s FIU reports to the presidency, leaving it vulnerable to political influence and dependent on the presidency for support; elevating the FIU to independent agency status would further insulate it from outside influence.  The CFZ remains vulnerable to illicit financial and trade activities, due to weak customs enforcement and limited oversight of transactions.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Panama adopted a U.S.-style accusatory penal system in 2016.  Law enforcement and judicial entities are underfunded and still lack experience and effectiveness under the new system, and a lack of coordination between these entities has resulted in few successful investigations, prosecutions, and convictions.  Panama needs to provide more robust financial investigative training to law enforcement, prosecutors, and judges and prioritize financial investigations beyond cases related to drug trafficking.  Panama does not yet accurately track criminal prosecutions and convictions related to money laundering.  Law enforcement needs more tools and protection to conduct long-term, complex investigations, including undercover operations.  The criminal justice system remains at risk of corruption.  The United States and Panama signed a MOU to create the joint Anti-Money Laundering and Anti-Corruption Task Force on July 31, \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  153  2020.  The taskforce will focus on non-narcotics-related money laundering investigations that identify corruption and other crimes stemming from money laundering, such as tax evasion.   Paraguay   OVERVIEW  Paraguay’s economy shows signs of recovery after the COVID-19 pandemic negatively impacted the manufacturing and service sectors and closed Paraguay’s borders to international visitors for seven months, resulting in significant negative growth from March to May 2020.  The tri-border area, comprised of the shared border areas of Paraguay, Argentina, and Brazil, is home to a multi-billion-dollar illicit goods trade, including marijuana cultivation and the trafficking of Andean cocaine and arms, which facilitates significant money laundering in Paraguay.  The government has worked to reduce the criminal use of Paraguay’s financial system to launder illicit proceeds by taking steps to address corruption, eliminate bureaucratic inefficiencies, and enhance interagency coordination.  President Mario Abdo Benitez’s administration continues to focus on these efforts, showing results in terms of arrests and modest progress toward implementation of new legislation; however, convictions remain rare.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Money laundering occurs in both financial institutions and the non-financial sectors.  Vulnerabilities include a large number of unregistered exchange houses; the frequent use of cash; the use of false information to register businesses; lax regulation of import-export businesses, casinos, and MSBs; weak border controls; corrupt government agents; and insufficient oversight of a high volume of money transfers to Lebanon and China.  Transnational and local criminal organizations continue to take advantage of largely informal economies and lax border controls in Ciudad del Este and other border towns to engage in TBML, narcotics and arms trafficking, goods smuggling and counterfeiting, and document forgery.  Criminal organizations disguise the laundering of proceeds from these activities in the high flow of both counterfeit and legitimate goods sold into Brazil from Paraguay, often with the assistance of co-opted government officials.   Paraguay operates two FTZs in Ciudad del Este but does not have an offshore sector.  Paraguay’s port authority manages free trade ports and warehouses in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, and Uruguay.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Paraguay has KYC and STR regulations applicable to a wide range of entities, and EDD is required for PEPs.   Paraguay passed two significant AML-related laws in 2020.  Both laws improved the National Secretariat for Asset Forfeiture’s (SENABICO) ability to manage and earn profit from seized criminal assets.  Asset sharing legislation has been in place for some time; Paraguay’s \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  154  framework includes laws approving the UNTOC and UNCAC and SENABICO Law 5876 (2017), which speaks to international cooperation for the administration of assets and the application of international conventions.  Paraguay made progress in implementing some of the ten significant AML-related laws passed in 2019.  Specifically, the Supreme Court formalized procedures outlining the scope and functions of newly-created criminal and appeals courts specialized in money laundering.    There is no bilateral MLAT between Paraguay and the United States.  Both are party to multilateral conventions providing for cooperation in criminal matters.   Paraguay is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available in Spanish only at:  https://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/n-r/paraguay/documents/mutualevaluationofparaguay.html.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Paraguay struggles to investigate and prosecute complex money laundering cases within the statute of limitations, in part because of a disjointed AML regime, officials’ lack of experience, judicial delays, and lack of interagency cooperation.  Though the Central Bank of Paraguay (BCP) has authority to review banks for money laundering compliance independent of Paraguay’s FIU, the Anti-Money Laundering Secretariat (SEPRELAD), the sanctioning regime is not effective, as SEPRELAD and the BCP have different guidelines regarding when an entity should submit a STR.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Paraguay continues to take steps to implement international AML standards.  During 2020, Paraguay initiated several more high-profile money laundering cases against multiple offenders than it did in 2019.  Authorities have conducted search warrants, and in some cases filed preliminary charges and formal indictments.  As with past cases, the challenge will be seeing these cases through to completion and conviction.  The $1 billion Megalavado case, opened in 2014, remains under investigation but without indictments or convictions.   SEPRELAD is working with the BCP to improve coordination and the quality of STRs, which are primarily submitted by banks.  Despite significant outreach to the banks, only approximately one percent of the STRs received by SEPRELAD meets the threshold to open a criminal investigation.  During the first six months of 2020, SEPRELAD received 5,811 STRs, a 43 percent decrease over the same period in 2019.  This decline is likely due to decreased economic activity after the government introduced strict COVID-19 mitigation measures in March 2020 that required many businesses to cease activities for three to seven months.  As of October 2020, SEPRELAD’s Directorate of Financial and Strategic Analysis forwarded 66 financial intelligence reports to various Paraguayan authorities.   In 2020, SENABICO increased its staff to 27, but the government cut its budget by over 15 percent from $648,000 to $510,000.  Regardless, the amount of assets seized by SENABICO continues to grow, and presently totals over $165 million.  SENABICO has struggled to fulfill its \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  155  mission due to non-cooperation from other government entities, such as the Solicitor General and judges who are unfamiliar with SENABICO’s mandate and unwilling to relinquish authority to SENABICO.  The Paraguayan government made modest progress toward implementing new laws passed in 2019, but continues to struggle to obtain money laundering convictions.   Paraguayan Customs continues to operate a TTU to combat TBML and other customs crime through the sharing and analysis of international trade data.   Peru   OVERVIEW  Peru had three presidents in 2020.  Peru struggles to effectively enforce and implement its strong AML legal regime.  Poor interagency coordination, limited information sharing, and corruption within the justice sector impede enforcement efforts.  Weak regulatory enforcement and oversight of the small-scale mining and timber sectors are concerns.    The Peruvian government identified $1 billion in potentially illicit funds flowing through Peru from January to September 2020 – a 43 percent decrease from the same period in 2019.  This occurred in a period when Peru enforced one of the strictest COVID-19 lockdowns and experienced one of the sharpest economic contractions in Latin America, severely restricting efforts to combat money laundering.  Illegal gold mining made up the vast majority of identified funds at $927 million, while drug trafficking comprised $8.2 million.  Illegal mining constitutes 48 percent of all money laundered in Peru in the past nine years, by far the largest sector.  Drug traffickers launder profits through illegal mining activities and gold transactions.    The government implemented steps to strengthen its AML regime in 2020, including establishing a special prosecutor’s office for asset forfeiture and gaining authorization from the OECD to exchange international financial and tax information.  Peru also continued implementing its 2018-2021 National Plan to Combat Money Laundering and showing successful results in its asset forfeiture system.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES     Illegal gold mining and logging, drug trafficking, and public corruption continue as the primary sources of illicit funds in Peru.  State presence is limited outside of coastal areas and large population centers.  Peru’s challenging geography allows for the transit of large quantities of illegal goods, contraband, and cash across its borders and internally.  Weak regulatory enforcement allows illegal gold to be mixed with licit gold in the supply chain, as well as illegal timber with licit timber.    Individuals and organizations typically funnel illicit funds through front companies.  Illicit funds also move through real estate, currency exchanges, credit cooperatives, auto sales, virtual \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  156  currency, and notaries.  Use of financial technology and virtual currencies is growing in Peru, with more than 34 new financial technology companies founded since 2016 and $355 billion in transactions from 2016-2018.  A virtual currency investment group stated Peru has the third highest transaction volume for virtual currencies in Latin America.  In August 2020, the FIU started supervising virtual currency exchanges.  In October 2020, the FIU began a risk analysis of virtual currency and bitcoins, which will inform the drafting of a specific regulation.    Peru’s gaming industry reported $780 million in earnings in 2018 from 314 registered companies with 723 locations.  Peru lacks adequate controls on the gaming sector, given the risks for money laundering.  Of 15,736 STRs filed in 2018, 33 originated from the gaming industry.  Peru conducted a risk analysis of the gaming industry in 2019; the final report is forthcoming.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS    Peru has a robust AML regulatory framework, and legislation establishes money laundering as an autonomous crime and includes KYC and STR requirements.  Regulations define and require EDD for PEPs.  In October 2020, the OECD Global Forum authorized Peru to exchange international tax and financial information on business and residents of Peru after evaluating its data confidentiality and protection.    The U.S. DEA participates in Peru’s Money Laundering Task Force, which includes the Peruvian National Police (PNP), public prosecutors, and the FIU.  The DEA and PNP develop and share criminal intelligence on major international drug trafficking and money laundering organizations, while prosecutors collect and exchange information on criminal investigations through mutual legal assistance requests.    Peru is a member of the GAFILAT, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/mer-peru-2019.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES    Peru should improve its interagency coordination, such as by amending the FIU’s authorities outlined in Law 27693.  This law permits the FIU to share its reports only with public prosecutors.  The government is receptive to recommendations from donors and experts regarding potential improvements.     ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS    Pervasive corruption hampers prosecutions of narcotics-related money laundering crimes.   Political figures, judges, and legislators have been implicated in money laundering, creating an impediment to progress on reform.  The Peruvian government estimates corruption generated $7.8 million in illicit proceeds from January to September 2020.  From January to June 2019, Peru convicted seven individuals for money laundering and financial crimes.  At the same time, Peru’s new asset forfeiture system issued a record 43 orders against assets worth over $24 million from January through September 2020 and had 501 cases in process in October 2020.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  157  High turnover of specialized prosecutors, lack of awareness of international conventions, and corruption in the justice sector hinder enforcement efforts.  The Attorney General’s office improved its capacity to investigate money laundering by establishing a special prosecutor’s office on asset forfeiture and hiring 80 accountants for its forensic unit.    Peru continues to lack effective regulatory enforcement and oversight in the small-scale mining sector.  In February 2020, authorities seized alleged illegal gold worth $10 million from a criminal organization accused of exporting to Switzerland, the Netherlands, Germany, Dubai, India, and China, and earning an estimated $11.5 million per month.      Philippines   OVERVIEW  The COVID-19 pandemic is disrupting global economic activities, prompting new threats and vulnerabilities for the Philippines.  Amidst these new challenges, existing criminal networks continue to engage in criminal activity to generate illicit funds, including environmental crimes and trafficking in people, narcotics, and arms.    To mitigate the effects of criminal activities, the Philippine government has continued its effort to build the capacity of its Anti-Money Laundering Council (AMLC) to counter money laundering and terrorism financing.  In 2019, international experts noted very serious risks of financial crime, including money laundering and terrorist financing, and low levels of government effectiveness in combating those threats.  Despite new momentum to strengthen the overall AML regime, the Philippines falls short in its effectiveness against money laundering, according to the Philippine government's own assessment.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Drug trafficking remains a pervasive challenge to the Philippine government, with increased drug activity observed at seaports and across its porous maritime borders.  Fifty-four percent of cases filed by the AMLC from January 1 to September 25, 2020 were predicated on violations of the Comprehensive Dangerous Drug Act.  Schemes included the delivery of illegal goods through private couriers pretending to carry medical or food items during periods of strict quarantine.    The banking sector, MSBs, and pawnshops remain primary channels for laundering funds.  The COVID-19 quarantine period also saw more than 13,000 transactions through suspected pass through or money mule accounts.  Reports of bulk cash entering through the airports increased; however, this is legal, if declared.  Lockdowns led to an increase in online shopping, which led to more cases of fraud.  Fake charity scams on social media also surged as did various “sextortion” and blackmail attacks.    The Philippines Bureau of Internal Revenue reported multiple cases of tax avoidance by online gaming firms catering to offshore bettors, known locally as “Philippine offshore gaming \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  158  operators” (POGOs).  According to Philippine authorities, a number of POGOs were operating without requisite licenses.  The Philippine congress and local media have raised concerns about money laundering and financial crimes facilitated through POGOs, which cater primarily to Chinese citizens gambling illegally.  However, no money laundering cases involving POGOs have yet surfaced.  There are indications this industry has declined due to new tax initiatives and COVID-19-related quarantine restrictions.   The Philippine Economic Zone Authority (PEZA) oversees 379 economic zones, which are generally adequately regulated.  There are also several other special economic zones and free ports that are held privately and do not fall under PEZA oversight.  Due to the separate authorities of the security and customs officials monitoring these zones, law enforcement officials face difficulty targeting illicit activity or organizations operating within them.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The AMLC now requires the prompt filing of STRs on attempted transactions.  The AMLC also expanded its information-sharing guidelines, allowing the sharing of information on PEPs outside election periods.  CDD requirements include EDD for PEPs, their families, and associates assessed as high-risk for money laundering.  The government also promulgated the Enforcement Action Guidelines, which provide procedures for the early resolution of administrative cases at the level of the Compliance and Supervision Group.  This approach will allow the AMLC to conserve resources and enables timely action to correct violations or deficiencies prior to the filing of a formal charge.    The AMLC and the Philippine Strategic Trade Management Office recently drafted counter-proliferation finance legislation in consultation with international legal experts.  The Philippines and the United States have a bilateral MLAT; however, its effectiveness is limited because the AMLC must obtain an order from the court of appeals to obtain bank records.  This process can take more than one year.   The Philippines is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.apgml.org/documents/search-results.aspx?keywords=philippines.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   In the wake of a recent controversy regarding a German company, which lost $2.21 billion in a scam involving fake documents from Philippine banks, the AMLC reiterated the need to amend the Bank Secrecy Act to close certain loopholes that make money laundering difficult to investigate.  The act treats all bank deposits as absolutely confidential, with limited exceptions.  The AMLC has very limited authority and relies on other agencies to investigate predicate crimes.  However, those agencies do not have authority to obtain bank records.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  159  The AMLC proposed several legislative amendments to treat tax crimes as money laundering predicate crimes, include real estate developers and brokers as covered persons, and expand the investigative powers of the AMLC by providing subpoena and contempt authority.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  From January to December 2020, AMLC filed 79 cases in civil and criminal courts, including three petitions for asset forfeiture.  The recent passage of the Anti-Terrorism Act of 2020 may facilitate the adjudication of money laundering cases.  The AMLC used this law in December 2020 to execute a freeze order on suspected terrorist accounts.    Challenges for the AMLC include lack of asset forfeiture training, insufficient law enforcement resources, and lack of a holistic approach in investigating financial crimes.    The AMLC is working to strengthen international and interagency cooperation through information sharing and capacity building to facilitate the efficient investigation and prosecution of money laundering, terrorist financing, smuggling, and graft and corruption.   Russian Federation   OVERVIEW  Russia has developed a robust AML/CFT legal framework with the Russian Financial Monitoring Service (FMS), the FIU, at its center.  Corruption, misappropriation and embezzlement of public funds, tax evasion, fraud, and drug trafficking generate significant proceeds.  There is a large shadow economy approaching 13 percent of the Russian GDP, according to the latest estimates by the Federal Statistics Service.  Although cash in circulation as a percentage of total money supply has declined from a historical peak of 43 percent on November 1, 1998, to 21.6 percent on September 1, 2020, there was a 23.7 percent surge in the value of cash in circulation in January-September, largely related to COVID-19 restrictions.  Financial flows from illicit activity linked to Russia have threatened weak financial institutions in neighboring countries; however, they also make their way to global financial centers, often through opaque shell companies.    The total amount of funds moved offshore through Russian commercial banks via suspicious transactions declined 72.2 percent year-on-year in the first half of the year to approximately $259.5 million, down from approximately $474.4 million in the same period in 2019, according to the Central Bank of Russia (CBR).  Although Russia has made some progress on AML, various investigations have alleged the existence of schemes designed to launder billions of dollars out of Russia.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Official corruption at all levels of government constitutes one of the largest sources of laundered funds.  Russia is also a transit and destination country for international narcotics traffickers, \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  160  particularly from Afghanistan.  Cybercrime remains a significant problem, and Russian hackers and organized crime structures continue to work together.  Criminals launder funds through banks, hawala networks, real estate, industrial entities, and luxury goods.   Although Russia has encouraged domestic development of blockchain-based technologies, the Russian government does not have a consistent position on the regulation of virtual currency.    There is a large migrant worker population in Russia.  Many remittances are sent through an informal value transfer system that may pose vulnerabilities for money laundering.  Gaming is only allowed in specified regions.  The FIU monitors casinos for AML/CFT compliance, while other agencies supervise other parts of the gaming sector.  Online gaming is prohibited.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Russia’s AML laws and regulations include the Federal Law on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing and numerous accompanying regulatory acts.  Money laundering is criminalized in the Criminal Code of the Russian Federation.  The criminal procedural code provides a comprehensive set of rules, including those permitting international cooperation on money laundering investigations; and the Code on Administrative Offenses contains civil penalties for violations of AML requirements.  Russia has KYC and STR requirements in place.  Russia conducted its first comprehensive money laundering NRA in 2018 and adopted an AML action plan.  The United States and Russia are parties to a bilateral MLAT.  Russia is a member of the FATF and two FATF-style regional bodies, MONEYVAL and the EAG.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/n-r/russianfederation/documents/mer-russian-federation-2019.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  The Finance Ministry unveiled the Comprehensive Russian Anti-Sanctions Plan in 2018 to mitigate the impact of Western sanctions through various measures, including suspension of disclosure requirements.  There is no corporate criminal liability in Russia.  A bill providing for such liability has been stalled in the Duma since 2015.  Currently, any breach of AML requirements is an administrative offense subject to a fine imposed on executives and companies in question or to a suspension of corporate activities for up to 90 days.  At the end of 2018, the FMS drafted two amendments to the Russian Code of Administrative Offenses to significantly increase administrative fines levied on corporations for violation of Russia’s AML/CFT legislation.  The amendments have not yet been submitted to the State Duma.  Financial institutions are required to conduct EDD on their relationships with some PEPs, but the national list is appointment-based, not based on key functions, and close associates of PEPs are \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  161  not covered.  Trusts cannot be created under Russian law, but Russians can be trustees and beneficiaries of trusts with little oversight.  Russia’s cash declaration system is only applicable at the external borders of the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), meaning currency can move undeclared across Russia’s borders within EAEU borders.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  In addition to the FMS, the enforcement aspect of financial investigations in Russia is conducted by the Financial Investigations Divisions of the Federal Security Service and the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  Normally, these entities work closely with the FMS to develop actionable intelligence pertaining to drug trafficking and criminal and terrorist organizations utilizing Russian financial networks in order to facilitate their criminal enterprises.    In 2019, the FMS prevented the laundering of approximately $3.1 billion through the Russian banking sector and recovered approximately $463 million in corruption proceeds.  The CBR revoked 31 credit institution licenses in 2019 and 15 bank licenses as of September 1, 2020.   St. Kitts and Nevis   OVERVIEW  St. Kitts and Nevis is a federation composed of two islands in the Eastern Caribbean.  Its economy is reliant on tourism, its economic citizenship program, and the offshore sector.  St. Kitts and Nevis is making progress in its AML regime.  The Financial Services Regulatory Commission (FSRC) (St. Kitts Branch) is responsible for the licensing, regulation, and supervision of the non-bank financial sector in St. Kitts.  As of September 2019, the regulated entities supervised by the St. Kitts Branch are two insurance managers, 48 trust and service providers, 16 domestic insurance companies, 11 MSBs, four credit unions, and one development bank.  There is no recent information on the number of IBCs, limited liability companies, or trusts in Saint Kitts.    The FSRC (Nevis Branch) licenses, regulates, and supervises covered persons and entities in Nevis that conduct fiduciary and international financial services businesses.  As of September 2019, the Nevis Branch supervised 16 insurance managers, two international banks, 53 registered agents/service providers, three international insurance brokers, five MSBs, and 234 international insurance companies.  FSRC Nevis statistical bulletins reflect the establishment of 765 IBCs, 464 LLCs, 88 trusts, and 11 foundations from January through November 2020.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Drug trafficking and fraud are identified as the primary sources of illicit funds.  According to a Joint Intelligence Office and Caribbean Customs Law Enforcement Council (CCLEC) activity \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  162  report, the money laundering risk in the country is high and the movement of cash in the region is high.  Current trends indicate illegal cash moves across the region predominantly by air travel.      Bearer shares are authorized and must be held by approved custodians.  Specific identifying information must be maintained on bearer certificates.    Individuals are eligible for citizenship by investment (CBI) with a minimum real estate investment of $200,000-$400,000 for each main applicant, or through a $150,000 contribution to the Sustainable Growth Fund.  Applicants must make a source of funds declaration with supporting evidence.  International contractors conduct due diligence on applicants.  To strengthen this process, regulations were approved to collect biometric data on all CBI applicants.  An applicant who has provided false information, has a criminal record, is the subject of a criminal investigation, and/or is involved in nefarious activity, shall not be approved for citizenship.  Applicants from North Korea, Iran, and Afghanistan are prohibited.  With some exceptions, an expedited 60-day accelerated application process is available.  Applicants can obtain citizenship for themselves, a spouse, dependent children up to 30 years old, and dependent parents aged 55 or older.  Canada requires visas for St. Kitts and Nevis passport holders due to security concerns with some CBI passport holders.     There are approximately 14 entities licensed under the St. Christopher and Nevis Betting and Gaming (Control) Act.  While the gaming board is responsible for the general oversight of gaming in St. Kitts and Nevis, the FSRC has limited responsibilities for AML/CFT supervision of casinos.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  AML legislation is at the federation level and covers both St. Kitts and Nevis, giving each island the authority to organize its own financial structure and procedures.  St. Kitts and Nevis has KYC and STR regulations and EDD for PEPs.   The Customs Act No. 19 of 2014 was amended to include bearer negotiable instruments in the definition of goods.    St. Kitts and Nevis has an MLAT with the United States.  The Royal St. Kitts and Nevis Police (RSCNPF) has provided police to police assistance to U.S. law enforcement agencies and other Caribbean jurisdictions.    St. Kitts and Nevis is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at: https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/saint-kitts-and-nevis-1.      AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   International experts have recommended improvement in the following areas:  ensuring information is available in a timely fashion on all owners, partners, and beneficial owners of a partnership or company; and ensuring the availability of accounting information for such entities.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  163  Nevis can form an IBC or LLC in less than 24 hours, and bearer shares are allowed, though discouraged.  Strict secrecy and confidentiality laws cover IBCs and trusts.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The St. Kitts and Nevis National AML/CFT Committee is charged with issuing operational guidelines to agencies, engaging public/private stakeholders, and developing policies and guidelines to maintain the AML/CFT regime.    There were no money laundering convictions in 2020; however, seven people were arrested and charged with money laundering offenses.  These cases are pending. In 2020, the RSCNPF continued to increase staff and pursue relevant training.   The St. Kitts and Nevis Customs and Excise Department (CED) continues to work closely with other border agencies and on regional levels to identify and detect illegal transfers of cash into/out of the country.  A risk-based approach is applied to courier shipments.  From mid-November 2019 to October 2020, the CED investigated 14 major cases, most of which involved the illegal importation of hashish and cannabis.  Five cases are pending trial and two cases resulted in convictions.  The illicit drugs seized in these cases had a street value of $273,234 ($738,415 Eastern Caribbean dollars).  Most of the seized drugs were imported via air through courier services from the United States.  The CED also took part in two joint operations with the RSCNPF and the immigration department involving the smuggling of illegal immigrants into the country.  The CED is a member of the CCLEC.     St. Lucia   OVERVIEW  St. Lucia’s main source of revenue is tourism.  St. Lucia made some progress on its AML regime.       VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   St. Lucia reports the narcotics trade is the primary source of illicit funds.  St. Lucia’s geographic location and porous borders increase its risk of drug money laundering.  Money laundering most commonly occurs through structured deposits and currency exchanges or cash real estate transactions.  St. Lucia identifies jewelry dealers, legal services, and NPOs as additional sectors vulnerable to money laundering activity.      St. Lucia’s Financial Services Regulatory Authority (FSRA) listed the following regulated entities on its website:  25 insurance companies, 16 credit unions, 12 international banks, 33 international insurance companies, and 13 MSBs.  The FSRA’s 2018 Annual Report indicates there were 3,812 IBCs incorporated on St. Lucia and 40 international trusts as of yearend 2017.     IBCs can be incorporated in one day and nominee directors are allowed.  Amendments to the International Business Company Act and regulations in 2018 and 2019 provide that any IBC \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  164  incorporated as of January 1, 2019, or later will be considered a “resident” company, able to do business with residents, no longer exempt from taxes, and required to file an annual tax return based on unaudited financial statements.  Additionally, IBCs must maintain registers of beneficial owners, notification must be provided of any changes in beneficial ownership within a “reasonable” time period, and the register should be available to competent authorities.  IBCs incorporated before December 31, 2018, will continue to be treated under the old law until June 20, 2021.  St. Lucia also amended its International Trusts Act (ITA) on December 12, 2018, to add a similar beneficial ownership register requirement and to allow competent authorities access to the register and other trust documents.  On December 31, 2018, the government passed the International Trust (Repeal) Act, which will repeal the ITA as of June 30, 2021.    There is one FTZ operating in Vieux Fort.  St. Lucia’s citizenship by investment program, launched in 2015, is the region’s newest program.  An individual can apply for St. Lucian citizenship through a minimum donation to the National Economic Fund of $100,000 per applicant, $165,000 for an applicant and spouse, or $190,000 for a family of up to four people.  Other options include a $300,000 minimum purchase in real estate; a $3.5 million investment for an individual, or $6 million for more than one applicant, in an approved enterprise project; or a government bond minimum purchase of $500,000 for an individual, $535,000 for an applicant and spouse, or $550,000 for a family of up to four people.  Applicants must apply through a government-approved local agent.  An in-person interview is not required.  Applicants must make a source of funds declaration and provide evidence supporting the declaration.  International firms perform due diligence checks on applicants.  The government established a Citizenship by Investment Unit to manage the screening and application process.  Applicants can obtain citizenship for dependent children up to 25 years old, disabled children of any age, and dependent parents.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The key AML laws in St. Lucia are the Money Laundering (Prevention) Act of St. Lucia (MLPA), the Money Laundering (Prevention) Regulation of St. Lucia, and the Proceeds of Crimes Act of St. Lucia (POCA).  The MLPA creates money laundering offenses and provides for the forfeiture of property connected to the money laundering.   The MLPA and its regulations mandate reporting entities undertake the appropriate KYC, record keeping, and CDD measures.  Reporting entities are also mandated to conduct EDD for high-risk customer categories, including PEPs.  MLPA Regulation 170 stipulates covered institutions are required to maintain all relevant records on the identity and transactions of their customers, both locally and internationally, for seven years, or longer if required by the FSRA.  The MLPA makes it an offense to make a false source of funds declaration of approximately $9,250 and above.  A violation carries a penalty of approximately $18,500 or five years’ imprisonment.  There is a draft amendment to the MLPA to effectively remove the monetary threshold.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  165   St. Lucia has KYC and STR regulations and EDD for PEPs.  The Eastern Caribbean Central Bank regulates onshore commercial banks in St. Lucia.  There is an MLAT between the governments of St. Lucia and the United States.  For drug investigations, illicit proceeds records may be shared informally through FIU and law enforcement channels.  However, for judicial proceedings, the provisions stipulated in the MLAT are used.  St. Lucia is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/s-t/saintlucia/documents/mutualevaluationofsaintlucia.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   St. Lucia is generally in technical compliance with international standards.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  One money laundering charge was brought in 2020 in the amount of approximately $144,750.  In 2020, St. Lucia had three cash seizures with a total value of approximately $65,450  and one forfeiture with a value of approximately $70,650.  Cash seizures and forfeiture were done pursuant to the POCA and the proceedings are civil in nature.     St. Vincent and the Grenadines   OVERVIEW  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines continues to make progress with its AML regime.  The FIU has a good reputation in the Eastern Caribbean and cooperates with the United States regularly.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines addresses money laundering challenges through annual FIU training of financial institution compliance officers.  The core training objectives are to identify the common trends and typologies relating to money laundering vulnerabilities.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines’ economy is dependent on tourism and its offshore financial services sector.  There are no FTZs or economic citizenship programs.  Gaming is legal, but there are no casinos in operation.  As of year-end 2019, the FIU reports there are three international banks, five international insurance companies, 24 domestic insurance companies, 16 insurance agents, six credit unions, 15 registered agents, 53 mutual funds, two MSBs, 4,284 IBCs, 70 international trusts, 153 limited liability companies, and 27 pension plans.  IBCs can be incorporated in less than 24 hours from receipt of application.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  166  Physical presence is not required for offshore sector entities and businesses, with the exception of offshore banks.  Resident nominee directors are not mandatory except when an IBC is formed to carry on banking business.  Bearer shares are permitted for IBCs, but not for IBCs conducting banking functions.  The government requires registration and custody of bearer share certificates by a registered agent who must also keep a record of each bearer certificate issued or deposited in its custody.    Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reports that drug trafficking, in particular marijuana, is the main source of illicit funds.  The country is the Eastern Caribbean’s leading producer of marijuana, and narcotics are transferred to speedboats at beaches on the leeward side or on uninhabited Grenadine islands.  Couriers carry money through the airport, ports, or other points of entry.  Sometimes money remitters are used.    The country has made efforts against drug trafficking by imposing strict penalties.  It is also engaged with the regional security system to coordinate border control issues and is developing its Coast Guard to patrol the coastline.  In December 2018, parliament passed legislation legalizing cultivation and use of marijuana for medicinal purposes.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has comprehensive AML legislation and regulations, including the 2017 Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Act (POCAA) and the 2017 Anti-Money Laundering Terrorist Financing Code.    Saint Vincent and the Grenadines initiated the following legislative improvements in 2020.    The Consumer Protection Act No. 12 of 2020 protects consumer interests and establishes a department responsible for consumer affairs.  It also prohibits Ponzi schemes and gives the consumer affairs department the authority to cooperate and share information on Ponzi schemes with the police and the FIU.  Promoting, operating, or participating in pyramid schemes is punishable by a fine of up to $3,700 and up to two years’ imprisonment.   In 2020, the supervisory department of the FIU started risk-based assessments of non-regulated financial service providers (NRSPs) and DNFBPs.  The FIU published updated guidance and offered follow-on training.   In 2020, the FIU signed MOUs with the Commerce and Intellectual Property Office, the Ministry of Trade, and the Inland Revenue Department.  The MOUs’ objectives are to ensure the sharing of information to facilitate registration and proper supervision of the NRSPs.  The government uses its Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act to share information with the United States.    Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/saint-vincent-and-the-grenadines-1.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  168  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   There is no legislation governing the registration of the NRSP sector.  In light of this deficiency, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines drafted AML/CFT regulations for NRSPs.   The FIU will commence regulatory oversight upon passage of the updated legislation.  Virtual assets are not addressed under the current AML legal and regulatory framework.  The government plans to amend the definition of cash in the POCAA to include virtual assets as well as the virtual asset service providers under the regulations.  St. Vincent and the Grenadines should become a party to the UNCAC.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The St. Vincent and the Grenadines Financial Services Authority is the mandated regulatory body for the offshore financial sector, and the FIU is the supervisory authority for DNFBPs.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines increased interagency cooperation among the FIU, the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions, the Director of Public Prosecution, the Royal Saint Vincent and the Grenadines Police Force, the Coast Guard, Immigration, and Customs and Excise Department to strengthen relationships among AML stakeholders.  In May 2020, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines launched AMLive, a web-based e-reporting tool and case management solution now utilized by a wide variety of institutions as a digital component of their internal reporting procedures.  This is expected to enhance reporting and enable law enforcement to access an improved data set of SARs.   For 2020, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reported four persons were charged with money laundering.  One person was convicted; the other cases remain pending in court.     Senegal   OVERVIEW   Senegal’s strategic coastal location makes it a regional business center for Francophone West Africa.  Illicit proceeds are derived from both domestic and foreign crimes.     Senegal is exposed to risks from organized crime, drug trafficking, internet and other fraud, and a large informal, cash-based sector.  Major sources of illicit proceeds include narcotics, human trafficking, illegal trade in wildlife and timber, counterfeiting, and public corruption.   Senegal has strengthened its legal and institutional framework in recent years by adopting legislative and regulatory texts relating to the fight against money laundering, terrorist financing and related offenses, partially addressing identified gaps.  However, the provisions of the laws have yet to be fully implemented.  The government should do so without delay.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  169  Analysis shows weaknesses in the following areas:  lack of specialization among law enforcement officials, prosecutors, and judges in handling complex financial crime investigations; lack of accurate data on AML/CFT efforts and related risks; the absence of a non-conviction-based forfeiture law; weak awareness-raising programs for stakeholders; efficient implementation of a sanctions regime; and the need for improved legislation on the management and disposal of seized property and asset recovery.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Senegal’s strategic location supports the development of trade routes for illicit goods and funds.  Corruption and drug trafficking are the most likely sources of laundered proceeds.  Other predicate offenses include illicit trade in artisanal mining, car theft, smuggling, and counterfeiting, including counterfeit pharmaceuticals.  According to law enforcement reports, the banking, real estate, and DNFBP sectors along with cross-border movement of funds seem to be the laundering channels most frequently used by financial criminals.   Widespread use of cash, hawaladars, and new payment methods present money laundering vulnerabilities.  Mobile payment systems are gaining prominence.  However, resource constraints prevent effective AML/CFT supervision of these entities.   Touba is an autonomous municipality under the jurisdiction of the Mouride religious brotherhood.  As the center of a worldwide network of Mouride communities, Touba is the destination for a significant portion of remittances.  A mobile payment system recorded remittances of $2 million per day shortly after opening a new service for Touba.  These facts, combined with the national government’s limited authority in the city, make Touba vulnerable to money laundering.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   With the adoption of Decree No. 201-1499, Senegal has strengthened its domestic AML/CFT policy by expanding the Coordinating Committee to include other stakeholders.  The Committee, in its new composition, has developed and validated a work plan for 2020 and a five-year national strategy paper (2019-2024).  However, implementation of the 2020 work plan was constrained by the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic.   Senegal has developed a manual for the effective implementation of AML/CFT supervisory obligations in the microfinance sector.  This AML inspection manual aims to provide a suitable tool for risk-based supervision to better monitor and control the operations of the microfinance sector.  A draft decree to extend new supervision standards to NGOs is also currently under consideration.   The United States and Senegal do not have a bilateral MLAT or an extradition treaty.  Mutual legal assistance can and does occur through multilateral law enforcement conventions with applicable provisions or based on domestic law.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  170  Senegal is a member of the GIABA, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.giaba.org/reports/mutual-evaluation/Senegal.html.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Remaining AML/CFT shortcomings include deficiencies in the full criminalization of terrorist financing, weaknesses in the forfeiture regime, an inadequate criminal code, and the lack of a dedicated asset recovery agency.   Other outstanding deficiencies focus principally on people and entities providing money or value transfer services, including insurance companies, NGOs, and traditional financial networks.  These people/services are not required to be licensed or registered with any competent authority, are not subject to dissuasive sanctions for operating without a license or registration; and may rely on agents who are not involved in AML/CFT programs or monitored for compliance.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Senegal’s legal framework is largely in place albeit with some weaknesses.  Opacity and the inability to trace certain transactions adversely impact the implementation of AML/CFT measures.  Furthermore, the country suffers from a lack of data on money laundering, terrorist financing, and related risks.  Although a mechanism has been put in place to give effect to measures permitting assets to be frozen, enforcement is still lacking.      Guidance on money laundering/terrorist financing risks provided by supervisory institutions to reporting entities remains insufficient.  Improving banking and non-banking supervision is therefore an obvious and much needed way to strengthen AML/CFT systems in Senegal.  Corrective measures and proportionate sanctions that help to change behaviors and deter noncompliance should be consistently applied.   Sint Maarten  OVERVIEW   Sint Maarten is a semi-autonomous country within the Kingdom of the Netherlands (Kingdom). The Kingdom retains responsibility for foreign policy and defense, including entering into international conventions, with approval of the local parliament.  Sint Maarten has been recognized by the OECD as a jurisdiction that has implemented international tax standards.  The law enforcement MOU between the four Kingdom countries and the United States includes Sint Maarten.   On November 27, 2019, the CFATF issued a public statement asking its members to consider the risks arising from the deficiencies in Sint Maarten’s AML/CFT regime.  On July 28, 2020, the CFATF recognized Sint Maarten’s considerable efforts in addressing these risks and withdrew its call to members.     \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  171  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Sint Maarten has 13 officially licensed casinos serving a population of approximately 40,000 persons, up to 30,000 temporary residents, and the nearly two million tourists who visited annually before the COVID-19 pandemic.  Some gaming houses have reputations as money laundering centers, albeit not so much for the criminal money of customers, but more for the owners and their contacts.  Online gaming is legal.   Sint Maarten has offshore banks and companies.  Traditionally, money laundering occurs through business investments and international tax shelters.  Sint Maarten’s favorable investment climate and rapid economic growth over the last few decades drew wealthy investors to the island to invest in large-scale real estate developments, including hotels and casinos.  Hurricane Irma in 2017 destroyed many of those real estate developments.  The government of Sint Maarten continues to rebuild key infrastructure with relief money from the Netherlands administered by the World Bank.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   The reporting institutions obligated to report unusual transactions are investment administrators, credit institutions, investment funds, providers of management services, credit card companies and credit institutions, insurers and insurance brokers, money remitting companies, and the Central Bank of Curaçao and Sint Maarten.  The DNFBPs obligated to report are car dealers, jewelers, real estate agencies, lawyers, notaries, tax consultants, accountants, administration offices, and the gaming industry.  The gaming industry includes games of hazard, casinos, lotteries, and offshore (internet) gaming entities.  The transaction reporting threshold of $14,000 covers cash, precious metals, jewelry, and rare objects of high value.   The Kingdom may extend international conventions to the semi-autonomous countries.  The Kingdom extended to Sint Maarten the application of the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 1999 and the UNTOC in 2010.  With the Kingdom’s agreement, each semi-autonomous entity can be assigned a status of its own within international or regional organizations subject to the organization’s agreement.  The individual countries may conclude MOUs in areas in which they have autonomy, if these MOUs do not infringe on the foreign policy of the Kingdom.  Sint Maarten is a member of the OECD Global Forum on Transparency and Exchange of Information for Tax Purposes.     Sint Maarten is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/documents/cfatf-mutual-evaluation-reports/sint-maarten-1.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Sint Maarten has yet to pass and implement legislation to regulate and supervise its casino, lottery, and online gaming sectors in compliance with international standards.  In addition, the threshold for conducting CDD in the casino sector does not comply with international standards.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  172  The UNCAC has not yet been extended to Sint Maarten.  International regulations on combatting money laundering and the financing of terrorism activities have met resistance from politicians.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   The National Ordinance Reporting Unusual Transactions has an “unusual transaction” reporting system.  Covered entities are required to file unusual transaction reports (UTRs) with the FIU on any transaction that appears unusual or when there is reason to believe a transaction relates to money laundering.  If, after analysis of a UTR, a strong suspicion of money laundering arises, those suspicious transactions are reported to the public prosecutor’s office.   The 1981 MLAT between the Kingdom of the Netherlands and the United States applies to Sint Maarten and is regularly used by U.S. and Sint Maarten law enforcement agencies for international drug trafficking and money laundering investigations.  The 2004 U.S.-Netherlands Mutual Legal Assistance Agreement, incorporating specific U.S.-EU provisions, was not extended to Sint Maarten.    The harbor of Sint Maarten is well known for its cruise terminal, one of the largest in the Caribbean islands.  The seaport and airport are still recovering from the aftermath of Hurricane Irma.  Larger container ships dock their containers at the container facility, where they are picked up by regional feeders to supply the smaller, surrounding islands.  Customs and law enforcement authorities are alert for regional smuggling, TBML, and value transfer schemes.    In November 2020, the public prosecutor settled with three money laundering suspects for $200,000.     Spain  OVERVIEW  Spain proactively identifies, assesses, and understands its money laundering vulnerabilities and works to mitigate risks.  The country remains a logistical hotspot for organized crime groups based in Africa, Latin America, and the former Soviet Union and is a transshipment point for illicit drugs entering Europe from North Africa and South America.  Spain largely complies with international AML standards and, in general, has updated AML regulations and competent authorities.   The government continues to build on its already strong measures to combat money laundering.  In November 2019, Spain joined five other EU member states to call for the establishment of a new supervisory authority to lead the bloc’s AML efforts as well as updated AML regulations.  In May 2020, this effort culminated in the EC’s adoption of an action plan for a comprehensive EU policy on preventing money laundering and terrorism financing to be implemented by early 2021.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  173  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Spain is a transshipment point for the cross-border illicit flow of drugs.  Moroccan hashish and Latin American cocaine enter the country and are distributed and sold throughout Europe, with the resulting proceeds often returned to Spain.  Passengers traveling between Spain and Latin America reportedly smuggle sizeable sums of bulk cash in both directions.  Informal money transfer services also facilitate cash transfers between Spain and Latin America, particularly Colombia.  Law enforcement authorities have identified a trend of drugs and drug proceeds entering Spain from newer EU member states with weaker law enforcement capabilities. The major sources of criminal proceeds are drug trafficking, political influence and foreign corruption, organized crime, customs fraud, human trafficking, and counterfeit goods.  The most common means of laundering money are through real estate purchases and sales, the use of complex networks of companies and contracts, the exploitation of MVTS, and the use of cash couriers.  Illicit proceeds are primarily invested in real estate in the coastal areas in the south and east of Spain, but criminal groups also place money in other sectors, including services, communications, automobiles, artwork, and the financial sector.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Spain is largely compliant with international AML/CFT standards.  Spain’s current AML/CFT law entered into force in 2010.  All associated implementing regulations entered into force in 2014.  The country has comprehensive KYC and STR regulations, and PEPs are subject to EDD.    Spain is a member of the FATF.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/fuar-spain-2019.html.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Regulations issued by Spain in 2017 add to the information included by, and available to, financial institutions when processing wire transfers.  However, Spain can do more to encourage NGOs to use regulated financial channels.  Additionally, despite improvements in oversight in recent years, full enforcement of AML obligations for legal professionals remains a challenge for Spanish authorities.    Information about AML fines in Spain are not made available to the public.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Spain actively investigates money laundering.  In May 2020, the Spanish National Police (SNP) arrested 11 cybercriminals and was investigating five others for charges of money laundering, fraud, and belonging to a criminal organization.  After dismantling this organization, the SNP detected 150 bank accounts that had been used to defraud businesses across the United States, Italy, the Czech Republic, the Netherlands, Lebanon, and China.  The organization used a complex network of intermediaries and carveouts to hide the origin of money obtained by criminal means (primarily phishing and social engineering) and to obscure the final recipients of the funds. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  174   Spain actively prosecutes money laundering cases, including those involving third-party money laundering, self-laundering, and laundering the proceeds of both domestic and foreign predicate offenses.  Spain has had success disabling criminal enterprises and organized criminal groups by identifying and shutting down their complex money laundering networks of national and international companies.  However, the relatively low level of sanctions (terms of imprisonment and periods of disbarment) imposed for money laundering offenses is a weakness, as is the judicial system’s limited capacity to handle complex money laundering cases in a timely fashion.   Suriname   OVERVIEW   Money laundering in Suriname is linked to criminal activity related to the transshipment of cocaine, primarily to Europe.  Casinos, real estate, foreign exchange companies, car dealerships, and the construction sector remain vulnerable to money laundering due to lax enforcement, though Suriname’s FIU has increased its engagement with DNFBPs.  Public corruption also contributes to money laundering.  Profits from small-scale gold mining fuel a thriving informal sector.  Much of this money does not pass through the formal banking system.  In Suriname’s interior regions, bartering with gold is common.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Money laundering may occur in the formal financial sector, though there is no evidence the sector facilitates the movement of currency from illegal drug sales in the United States.  An approximately $23 million cash shipment by the Central Bank of Suriname was confiscated by Dutch authorities in 2018.  In December 2019, a Dutch court ruled that the Central Bank of Suriname enjoyed state immunity, and the money shipment was unlawfully confiscated.  Dutch prosecutors appealed the decision on the suspicion that the cash shipments – which belonged to three Surinamese banks – were connected to money laundering.  The three banks have filed a grievance.  Local banks have instituted rules on identifying the source of large cash deposits and limiting deposits of high-denomination currency.  Exchange houses have begun enforcing proof of identity.  Banks are promoting wire transactions and have introduced mobile services.  Suriname’s current domestic financial crisis may contribute to money laundering, as local banks cannot meet the U.S. dollar needs of their customers, and cash withdrawals are limited.  As a consequence, many Surinamers do not deposit their U.S. dollars in banks.  While Suriname depreciated its currency in September 2020, there is still a gap between the official exchange rate and the unofficial parallel rate.  This places unknown sums of cash outside of formal financial institutions.  Suriname has online gaming.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  175  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Suriname has an adequate legal framework for AML enforcement, but amendments need to be made to comply with international standards.  Suriname did not pass or amend AML legislation in 2020.  KYC and STR requirements cover banks and credit unions; asset managers; securities brokers and dealers; insurance agents and companies; currency brokers, remitters, and exchanges; auditors, accountants, and notaries; lawyers; real estate agents; dealers in gold or other precious metals and stones; gaming entities and lotteries; and motor vehicle dealers.     Suriname is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/member-countries/suriname.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Suriname has yet to complete an NRA, although one is underway.    Suriname has requirements for enhanced due diligence procedures for foreign, but not domestic, PEPs.   Supervision of DNFBPs remains limited.  The FIU has continued outreach activities to, registration, and inspections of DNFBPs.  The FIU is developing further technical skills with donor assistance.  Suriname is not a member of the Egmont group.    The government staffed the gaming board, but there is still little effective supervision of the large casino sector.  The Government of Suriname is not party to the UNCAC.   ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   In January 2020, then-central bank governor Robert van Trikt stepped down amid allegations of wrongdoing.  On February 6, 2020, he was arrested for violations of the Money Laundering Act.  On April 23, 2020, the attorney general submitted a request to the national assembly to start the process of charging then-finance minister Gillmore Hoefdraad for activities related to the Van Trikt case.  By Surinamese law, the national assembly must vote to allow an investigation of a current or former officeholder.  The national assembly voted against the attorney general’s request.  On July 20, 2020, following national elections, the attorney general submitted a new request, which the new national assembly approved.  As of November 2020, Hoefdraad’s whereabouts were unclear.  On August 11, 2020, Hoefdraad’s lawyers filed an injunction against the State of Suriname, the national assembly, and the Attorney General’s Office.  There are four other people in custody related to the Van Trikt case and Interpol arrest warrants out on three individuals - including the former minister of finance.       \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  176  Tajikistan   OVERVIEW  Money laundering in Tajikistan is associated with criminal activities, such as corruption, bribery, embezzlement, and drug trafficking.  Tajikistan is a transit country for Afghan opiates smuggled to Russia, Belarus, and some European countries via the so-called “northern route.”  Tajikistan has made significant efforts to improve its AML/CFT regime to reduce the risk for money laundering and terrorist financing.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Tajikistan shares an 835-mile border with Afghanistan, one of the world’s leading illicit opium producers.  Most drug seizures along the Northern Route in Central Asia occur in Tajikistan.  It is widely assumed drug trafficking is a major source of funds to be laundered.   Tajikistan’s location also makes it susceptible to terrorism and terrorist financing.  According to the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT), in the first nine months of 2020, there were four criminal cases related to terrorist financing in Tajikistan and one related to money laundering.  Corruption and bribery may also be major sources of criminal funds.  Remittances and trade with countries vulnerable to terrorist financing increase the risk and likelihood of money laundering in Tajikistan.    Criminal groups most likely launder illicit proceeds through Tajikistan’s banking sector.  Real estate transactions and company equity shares also may serve as mechanisms for laundering money.    There are four established free economic zones in Tajikistan:  Sughd, Panj, Dangara, and Ishkashim.  These free economic zones focus on manufacturing, and it is unclear what, if any, role the zones play in national or international money laundering.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Tajikistan has in place an AML/CFT legal framework.  In 2018, a presidential decree approved the National AML/CFT/proliferation financing (AML/CFT/PF) Concept 2018-2025.  The Tajik government has amended laws related to AML/CFT to comply with international standards and implemented recommendations made by international experts.  The Tajik government’s AML/CFT legal framework and concept paper mandate reforms by key agencies to prevent money laundering, but implementation is mixed.  The leading agency for combating money laundering is the Anti-Corruption Agency.  The Drug Control Agency under the President of the Republic of Tajikistan is responsible for combating drug-related money laundering.    Tajikistan is a member of the EAG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer-fsrb/Mutual-Evaluation-Report-Republic-Tajikistan-2018.pdf.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  177  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Oversight measures introduced to comply with legal requirements for AML/CFT exposed some technical shortcomings.  The existing process for STRs still needs enhancements.  For example, most credit institutions have automated the process for detecting suspicious transactions, but the overwhelming number of the questioned transactions were deemed remittance transfers or trade operations with countries rated as high-risk for terrorist financing.  Tajik financial institutions require additional training and technological resources to identify suspicious transactions.  Furthermore, the Tajik government could improve AML/CFT oversight of banking NPOs to prevent money laundering.      ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  All Tajik law enforcement agencies (the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Anti-Corruption Agency, the Drug Control Agency, the State Committee for National Security, and the Prosecutor General’s Office) are involved in detecting and investigating money laundering.  The level and quality of cooperation and coordination among these agencies could be improved though training, information sharing, and the establishment of multi-agency task forces.    Money laundering crimes are usually prosecuted as an additional element of a criminal case.  It is difficult to assess the effectiveness of money laundering investigations.  Pervasive corruption, which serves as both a source of illicit funds and a mechanism to prevent investigations, poses a challenge for AML efforts.  While training and other resources are needed to combat money laundering, Tajikistan also requires a comprehensive strategy to reduce corruption in the country.    Tanzania   OVERVIEW  Tanzania has introduced several laws to address money laundering and terrorism financing.  Zanzibar now recognizes the FIU as the national center for the receipt, analysis, and dissemination to law enforcement agencies of STRs.    Tanzania is vulnerable to money laundering and financial crimes due to its underdeveloped financial sector and limited capacity to address such criminal activity.  Criminal activities with nexuses to money laundering include transnational organized crime, tax evasion, corruption, smuggling, trade invoice manipulation, illicit trade in drugs and counterfeit goods, wildlife trafficking, and terrorism.  There continue to be high-profile arrests for money laundering; however, few cases result in convictions.  During the last 18 months, the Government of Tanzania has leveraged money laundering laws to jail journalists, activists, and others without bail.  The use of these laws for political purposes dilutes their efficacy in combating real crime.  On September 22, 2019, President Magufuli called for “amnesty” for those accused of money laundering and other economic crimes, in exchange for a guilty plea and fines.  Tanzania should commit to enforce money laundering laws in an even and transparent manner, and build \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  178  capacities among key stakeholders in the financial, law enforcement, customs, tax collection, and judicial sectors.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Tanzania’s large, porous borders and geographic position present challenges in combating financial crimes.  The vast majority of Tanzanians work in the informal sector, and thus use cash-based, informal, and nontraditional financial systems.  Over the past three years, the Tanzania Revenue Authority (TRA) dramatically increased efforts to collect taxes, often using aggressive tactics and levying arbitrary fines.  This has motivated businesses and individuals, especially international traders, to transfer more money outside the formal financial system to avoid taxation.  Criminals employ these same methods to move money.    Cross-border trade in used-cars, auto parts, clothing, cosmetics, and smuggled cigarettes and foodstuffs are of particular concern, along with illegal trade in precious minerals and stones.  Furthermore, front companies, hawaladars, and currency exchanges are used to launder funds, particularly in Zanzibar.  Tanzania’s two international seaports and other smaller ports create opportunities for TBML.    Foreign investment in the tourism sector in Zanzibar and real estate in both mainland Tanzania and Zanzibar are also used for money laundering.  In April 2019, Tanzania published its NRA (dated December 2016) on money laundering and terrorist financing covering the period of 2010-2015; the report identifies these same sectors as high-risk.   KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The government issued new regulations pertaining to money laundering and financial crime in 2019.  The Anti-Money Laundering (Amendment) Regulations of 2019 introduce stricter STR requirements, KYC identity document requirements, requirements to carry out money laundering and terrorist financing risk assessments, comprehensive CDD, and increased fines for noncompliance.  Zanzibar has its own Anti-Money Laundering and Proceeds of Crime Act and regulations.  Both the mainland and Zanzibar have KYC and STR regulations, which also carry strict noncompliance penalties.   The June 2019 Foreign Exchange Regulations tighten supervision of foreign exchange bureaus and make it more difficult to obtain a license.  The Miscellaneous Amendments Bill No. 7, passed in November 2019, includes an amendment to the Prevention of Terrorism Act that enables authorities to make regulations on the prohibition of terrorism financing.    Other relevant legislation and regulations include the Criminal Procedure Act; Economic and Organized Crime Control Act; Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters Act; and Proceeds of Crime Act.  The law allows mutual legal assistance requests and enforcement of foreign forfeiture orders but not asset sharing.   Tanzania does not have a formal records-exchange mechanism in place with the United States.  However, ongoing cooperation takes place through the Egmont Group.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  179   Tanzania is a member of the ESAAMLG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.esaamlg.org/index.php/Countries/readmore_members/Tanzania.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  Tanzania has strengthened its AML regulations, yet deficiencies remain.  Policy coordination within the government and consultation with the private sector and stakeholders is weak.  Additionally, authorities still have failed to address problems related to non-conviction-based forfeiture.  Regulations provide for a risk-based approach to KYC and CDD requirements; however, this approach has not yet been adopted and implemented.  Improvements to legal frameworks addressing financing terrorism and weapons of mass destruction, TBML, mobile money, and cryptocurrencies are necessary.   Tanzania’s track record of responding to requests for mutual legal assistance is poor.  Requests from the United States have been pending for over two years; other older cases have been closed following no response from the Tanzanian government.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Tanzania has limited capacity to implement money laundering laws and to supervise the banking sector.  Tanzania should increase awareness of money laundering issues within the financial, law enforcement, and judicial sectors and allocate the necessary human, technical, and financial resources to update and implement a national AML strategy.  Tanzanian authorities must ensure existing AML laws and regulations are enforced and applied in the spirit in which they are intended, not as a political tool, but with a focus on convicting criminals engaged in money laundering and financial crimes.   Thailand   OVERVIEW   Thailand is emerging as a logistics and financial hub within Southeast Asia.  The country’s porous borders and uneven law enforcement make it vulnerable to money laundering, drug trafficking, and other categories of transnational crime.  Thailand is a source, transit, and destination country for illicit smuggling and trafficking in persons, a production and distribution center for counterfeit consumer goods, and a center for the production and sale of fraudulent travel documents.  The proceeds of illegal gaming, official corruption, underground lotteries, and prostitution are laundered through the country’s informal financial channels.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Funds from various illegal industries are transported across Thailand’s four land borders and through airports and seaports.  Money launderers and traffickers use banks, non-bank financial institutions, and businesses to move the proceeds of criminal enterprises.  Unlicensed and \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  180  unregulated hawala brokers serve Middle Eastern travelers by transferring money through their own honor-based channels rather than formal financial instruments.  Unregulated Thai and Chinese remittance systems are also prevalent.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Thailand’s Anti-Money Laundering Act (AMLA) has been amended several times since its initial passage in 1999, broadening the overall scope of criminal liability and increasing powers to conduct investigations and make seizures.  Tax offenses, terrorism, and proliferation are money laundering predicate offenses.      AMLA Section 22 includes KYC and STR requirements.  The Anti-Money Laundering Office (AMLO) acts as the country’s FIU.  It is responsible for supervision of all reporting entities and is the key AML/CFT enforcement agency.  Financial institutions are required to keep customer identification and financial transaction data for five years from termination of relationship.  They must also keep due diligence records for ten years.  Penalties for violating reporting requirements can include potential asset seizure.  On August 12, 2020, AMLO issued updated CDD regulations CDD that refine definitions and clarify CDD processes to simplify compliance with international AML standards.  On June 15, 2020, the government held public hearings on proposed amendments to the AMLA and the CFT act to cover financial technology service providers and simplify appeals of designations.    Thailand has varying reporting requirements for the import and export of currency.  At airports, foreign or Thai Baht currency or other negotiable monetary instruments with aggregate values exceeding approximately $15,000 must be declared to customs.  Approval from the Bank of Thailand is required to take Thai currency (cash) in amounts exceeding approximately $1,700 out of the country.  The threshold is higher, at approximately $61,500, for Thai currency destined for Cambodia, Laos, Burma, Vietnam, Malaysia, and China’s Yunnan province.  For fund transfers to commercial banks, foreign (non-Thai) currency can be transferred into Thailand without limit.  However, the deposit must be transferred into an authorized bank and either be exchanged into Thai baht or held in a foreign currency account.  Any person purchasing, selling, depositing, or withdrawing foreign currencies from an authorized bank in the amount of $50,000 or above is required to report the transaction.   In March 2018, Thailand issued the Digital Asset Business Decree to regulate the offering of digital assets and bring the operations of crypto and other digital exchanges and intermediaries under the supervision of the Thai Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).   The royal decree covers cryptocurrencies, digital tokens, and any other electronic data unit, as specified by the SEC.  Exchanges, brokers, and dealers are required to apply for licenses from the Finance Ministry, and the SEC must approve initial coin offering portals.    The United States and Thailand have a bilateral MLAT in place.  Thailand actively shares information with international partners, including the United States, through the Egmont Group process.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  181  Thailand is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.apgml.org/documents/search-results.aspx?keywords=thailand.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Thailand has numerous unlicensed, unregulated informal remittance systems.  The AMLA’s compliance regime should be applied more strictly to these MSBs to deter their use as money laundering vehicles.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Operationally, Thai government authorities continue to utilize the AML regime to focus on nonconviction-based asset seizure and forfeiture, as well as criminal enforcement.  The AMLO is effective in fighting money laundering and can operate in conjunction with, or independently from, other law enforcement bodies.  The AMLO has exercised its authority to seize assets in a number of suspected human trafficking cases.  From January to October 2020, there were 90 prosecutions and 124 convictions.  In 2019, there were 208 prosecution and 245 convictions.    Thailand has some difficulty sharing information with jurisdictions that require separate MOUs outside of the Egmont Group.    Trinidad and Tobago   OVERVIEW    Trinidad and Tobago’s geographic location in the southern Caribbean, developed financial systems, and use by criminal organizations as a transshipment point for narcotics and other illicit goods make it vulnerable to money laundering.   In 2020, Trinidad and Tobago made progress toward strengthening its AML regime, including strengthening its legislative framework and investigating and prosecuting suspected cases of money laundering.  While continuing to improve, Trinidad and Tobago still has deficiencies in its AML regime that need to be addressed.     Despite some progress on judicial reform, existing vulnerabilities related to the country’s slow judicial system, prevalence of drug trafficking, corruption, and illegal gaming are reasons for concern.  Sustained political will, continued legislative and institutional reforms, including full implementation of laws and regulations, and adequate resources to detect, investigate, and prosecute money laundering-related offenses are needed to ensure the proper enforcement of Trinidad and Tobago’s AML regime.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES     Due to the country’s proximity to Venezuela and its position as a regional hub for commercial air and shipping, criminal organizations use Trinidad and Tobago for the transshipment of narcotics \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  182  and other illicit goods, creating significant monetary flows through the country.  The country’s relative wealth and well-developed financial sector increase the risk of money laundering.  Along with proceeds from illicit trafficking, fraud, tax evasion, corruption, and illegal gaming are among the most common sources of laundered funds.  There are indications that persons commingle funds between personal and business accounts or use remittance services, gaming institutions, and commercial and retail businesses to launder funds.     In August 2020, authorities warned of the growing prevalence of pyramid schemes in the country and urged citizens to exercise caution.  Authorities note that such schemes are potential avenues for money laundering activity.  Public casinos and online gaming are illegal but there are numerous illegal gambling enterprising operating in the country.  Illegal lotteries are also widespread and by some measures have a larger market share than the state lottery.      Trinidad and Tobago does not have an offshore banking sector nor an economic citizenship program.  Trinidad has FTZs but the companies operating within FTZs account for a modest portion of total exports.      KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS    Trinidad and Tobago has comprehensive CDD and STR regulations and requires enhanced due diligence for PEPs.   In 2019, Trinidad and Tobago passed legislation to allow for non-conviction-based asset recovery and “unexplained wealth” orders.  The law is currently subject to an appellate court review, but the government can enforce the provisions of the law pending the review process.  In August, the attorney general announced the Trinidad and Tobago police are investigating several matters pursuant to the new civil asset forfeiture law.    Trinidad and Tobago is party to an MLAT with the United States.  In 2019, the government issued a regulation to prioritize all requests for mutual legal assistance.   Trinidad and Tobago is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/member-countries/trinidad-and-tobago.    AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES     Criminal prosecutions take years, sometimes over a decade, to be resolved, and successful prosecutions of money laundering cases, while increasing, are still rare.  The lack of timely prosecutions has a corrosive impact on AML efforts and encourages others to engage in financial crimes.     The government is undertaking reforms aimed at speeding up the lengthy judicial process, which in the long term may lead to increased prosecutions of serious crimes, including money laundering.  In recent years, the government has passed several laws, including the introduction in 2019 of plea bargaining and judge-only trials, created new courts, and increased usage of technology in the court system.  While the government has been slow to utilize the plea \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  183  bargaining provisions, technological improvements, including the installation of donor-funded case management software, has increased efficiency in the judicial system.   The Trinidad and Tobago government may reintroduce legislation to regulate the gaming industry during the current legislative year.  A previous bill to regulate the gaming industry was introduced in 2016 but failed to gain support in parliament.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS     In 2017, Trinidad and Tobago made a high-level political commitment to strengthen the effectiveness of its AML regime and adopted an action plan to address identified deficiencies.  In 2020, Trinidad and Tobago continued to make progress on its action plan, subject to the sustained implementation of reforms.  In 2020, the government’s Financial Investigations Branch opened three investigations resulting in 66 total charges related to money laundering.  Nonetheless, Trinidad and Tobago still has deficiencies in its AML regime and proper implementation of reforms to counter money laundering will take time, sustained political will, and resources.      Turkey  OVERVIEW  Turkey’s strategic location between Europe and Asia, its significant trade with both continents and with the United States, and its commercial relationships and geographical proximity to politically turbulent and undemocratic countries complicate Turkey’s efforts to combat illicit finance.  Recent conflicts on Turkey’s southern border have aggravated those threats.  Turkey is a hub for licensed and unlicensed money remitters, many of which serve the approximately 4 million refugees in Turkey.  Turkey’s AML/CFT legislation is in line with international standards; however, Turkey continues to have few effective money laundering prosecutions and forfeiture actions.  Most forfeiture actions are focused on suspected followers of U.S. resident Fethullah Gulen, a group the Government of Turkey has designated a terrorist organization.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Turkey is part of the Balkan route used to smuggle illegal opiates from Afghanistan into Europe and a corridor for smuggling and trafficking migrants out of Syria and Iran.  The NRA identifies drug trafficking, migrant smuggling, human trafficking, and fuel smuggling as the crimes that pose the highest money laundering risk.  Turkey is a destination for illicit proceeds from cyber fraud perpetrated in the United States.  In 2019, Halkbank, a majority state-owned bank, was indicted in the United States on charges of fraud, money laundering, and participation in a multibillion-dollar scheme to evade U.S. sanctions on Iran.  Front companies and shell companies are misused to disguise illicit proceeds as legitimate income.  Unlicensed money remitters move bulk cash and use their bank accounts to move illicit proceeds through the financial system.  Additionally, virtual currency remains insufficiently \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  184  regulated and supervised.  As of January 1, 2020, the Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) licenses and supervises payment service providers and electronic money institutions.     Turkey is a hub for the proliferation and trafficking of sensitive technologies and weapons due to its proximity to countries attempting to circumvent international laws.  Many traffickers of such items can establish financial institution accounts because of inadequate CDD procedures.    Turkey lacks the legislation or methodologies to effectively combat money laundering through casinos linked to northern Cyprus.  U.S. law enforcement has tracked increasing amounts of illicit proceeds flowing from Istanbul to the “Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus,” a state only Turkey recognizes, and back into financial institutions in Turkey.  Turkish law enforcement acknowledges the legislative gap and its inability to combat illicit money movement through casinos.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Turkey’s criminalization of money laundering and legal authority for asset forfeiture are mostly in line with international standards.  Turkish legislation mandates CDD and STR reporting.    The Financial Crimes Investigation Board (MASAK), the Turkish FIU, is the AML regulatory and supervisory authority.  MASAK mainly relies on the prudential regulatory and supervisory authorities for onsite examinations.      Turkey is a member of the FATF.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/Mutual-Evaluation-Report-Turkey-2019.pdf.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Turkey needs to address the lack of policy and program coordination.  There is no centralized government AML policy to be implemented across all stakeholders using a risk-based approach.  Instead, the government embeds its AML approach in interagency national strategy policy papers and action plans on selected topics.  Turkey’s 2018 money laundering NRA is not publicly available.  Its conclusions have been shared with financial institutions and DNFBPs through workshops, and the government uses it to develop and refine AML strategies and policies.   Many financial institutions apply KYC procedures insufficiently.  Although there is no explicit obligation for EDD when doing business with foreign or domestic PEPs, financial institutions are required to implement EDD for high-risk groups, and MASAK reports most financial institutions regard PEPs as high-risk.  Trusts do not exist in Turkey.  There is no CDD guidance for financial institutions dealing with professional trustees providing services to foreign trusts and arrangements.      Turkey’s 120,000 NPOs are not regularly audited for money laundering activity and do not receive adequate AML guidance.  The government determined the 747 riskiest NPOs and has \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  185  subjected them to increased auditing.  Foreign NPOs are now subject to yearly audits.  In 2020, the government increased AML outreach and training for auditors and NPOs.  Turkey does not have asset sharing provisions as part of its forfeiture laws.    ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Turkey lacks the capacity to effectively identify, investigate, and successfully prosecute money laundering.  Since 2013, the number of money laundering prosecutions and convictions has been disproportionate to the volumes of filed STRs and predicate crime investigations.  Through 2019, roughly 365,000 STRs resulted in 11 money laundering convictions, and almost 290,000 criminal investigations of predicate crimes resulted in less than 50 money laundering convictions.  MASAK reports there were 203,786 STRs in 2019.  In 2019, there were a total of 220 prosecutions.     The U.S. DEA, in 2020, provided information to Turkish law enforcement to enable them to pursue potential drug trafficking or money laundering investigations in Turkey on their own or jointly with DEA.  Turkish law enforcement authorities were not receptive to U.S. government efforts to work with Turkey to open investigations.  Turkey and the United States have a Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement.  U.S. Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) established partnerships with both the Turkish National Police and the Ministry of Trade’s Customs Enforcement, enabling the interdiction of narcotics originating from Central and South America.  Turkish law enforcement is cooperative with HSI, engages in coordinated investigations, and proactively seeks assistance from the United States in these matters.   Turkmenistan  OVERVIEW   Turkmenistan is not a regional financial center and is relatively isolated from the global financial system.  Apart from the Central Bank of Turkmenistan, there are eight domestic banking institutions.  Among the largest domestic banks are Dayhanbank, which services the agriculture sector; Halk Bank, which manages private savings; Turkmenbashy Bank, which finances industrial infrastructure; and the State Bank for Foreign Economic Relations, which services major state- and privately-owned enterprises, including from the oil and gas sector.  Three foreign commercial banks have operations in Turkmenistan:  Turkmen-Turkish Joint Stock Commercial Bank, National Bank of Pakistan, and Saderat Bank of Iran.  Deutsche Bank and Commerzbank also have representative offices in Turkmenistan and provide bank guarantees to companies; they do not offer retail banking services.     The country’s significant mineral and hydrocarbon exports are paid for through offshore accounts with little public scrutiny or accounting.  Since the Government of Turkmenistan \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  186  introduced numerous limitations on foreign currency exchange in 2016, converting local currency (manat) into foreign currency has become very difficult.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Given Turkmenistan’s shared borders with Afghanistan and Iran, money laundering in the country could involve proceeds from the trafficking and trade of illicit narcotics, as well as those derived from domestic criminal activities, including corruption.  Although there is no available information on cash smuggling, gasoline, tobacco products, and other commodities are routinely smuggled across the borders.   Much of Turkmen wealth is kept offshore.  The government reportedly is working to address this issue.  In 2007, Turkmenistan created the Awaza Tourist Zone (ATZ) to promote development of its Caspian Sea coast.  Amendments to the tax code exempt construction and installation of tourist facilities in the ATZ from value added tax (VAT).  Various services offered at tourist facilities, including catering and accommodations, are also VAT-exempt.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS   Over the last few years, the government has taken positive steps to combat money laundering and corruption.  On June 2, 2017, the president created the State Service for Combating Economic Crimes (SSCEC) to analyze corruption and investigate and prevent crimes involving financial damage to the state, although its level of effectiveness remains in question.  On January 25, 2019, in order to better combat economic crimes and strengthen law enforcement agencies, President Berdymukhamedov signed a decree on the merger of the SSCEC with the Ministry of Internal Affairs.  This organization is joined by the Financial Monitoring Service (FMS) within the Ministry of Finance and Economy.  Formed in October 2018, the FMS is the FIU and the competent authority for the prevention of money laundering and terrorism financing.  The government also continues to pursue international cooperation to curb offshore tax evasion.   On August 18, 2015, the Turkmen Parliament adopted an AML/CFT law that came into effect on January 1, 2016.  The law addresses international cooperation and deficiencies regarding due diligence procedures for DNFBPs and PEPs, among other items.  Turkmenistan has KYC and STR regulations.   The United States does not have an MLAT with Turkmenistan.  Turkmenistan is a member of the EAG, a FATF-style regional body.  Turkmenistan’s most recent MER is available at:  https://eurasiangroup.org/en/mutual-evaluation-reports.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Lack of transparency, storage of wealth offshore, corruption, and a lack of investigative capacity all impact the supervision and regulation of financial institutions and the implementation of AML laws and regulations in Turkmenistan.  Serious enforcement efforts are necessary to \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  187  combat money laundering, and the government should accelerate reforms that will make Turkmenistan’s AML regime compliant with international standards.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS   Turkmenistan’s Inter-Agency Coordination Working Committee for Combating Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing operates under the Ministry of Finance.  The lack of government transparency makes it extremely difficult to get information on money laundering, and there were no reports of prosecutions or convictions for money laundering in 2019.   Turkmenistan’s legal system provides protection and exemption from liability for financial institutions filing STRs with the Financial Monitoring Service of Turkmenistan, the FIU, and sets limitations on the disclosure of information financial institutions obtain in performing their AML obligations.   In 2020, donors conducted seminars in Ashgabat for law enforcement agencies, supervisory bodies, and other relevant government and non-government agencies.  The seminars focused on mutual evaluations and compliance with international standards, countering terrorism finance, thwarting money laundering schemes, and suspicious transaction analysis and financial investigation.  There is a continued need for capacity building for law enforcement, customs, and border authorities to enable them to better recognize and combat money laundering.   Ukraine  OVERVIEW  Money laundering remains a significant problem in Ukraine.  The 2020 enactment of a new AML law provides some hope for improvement by enhancing the ability of regulators to detect and prevent financial crimes.    Public corruption is the primary source of laundered funds.  Ineffective state institutions allow criminal proceeds to go undetected.  Launderers register as ultimate beneficial owners (UBOs) under aliases to avoid detection and integrate laundered money into legal businesses.  Authorities still rarely target large-scale corruption-related money laundering operations.  The National Anti-Corruption Bureau of Ukraine (NABU) and the Specialized Anti-Corruption Prosecutor’s Office (SAPO) prosecute money laundering offenses as a mechanism for pursuing corruption.  However, legal maneuvers supported by entrenched interests jeopardize the independence and functionality of Ukraine’s anticorruption infrastructure and affect its AML/CFT efforts.  In August 2020, the Constitutional Court of Ukraine (CCU) determined provisions of the law establishing the NABU to be unconstitutional.  In October 2020, the CCU blocked prosecutions for illicit enrichment and halted the processing of public officials’ asset declarations.      \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  188  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Ukraine remains a transit country for drugs and other contraband trafficked to western and central Europe.  Transnational organized crime syndicates launder illicit profits in Ukraine.  Ukraine’s large shadow economy and heavy reliance on cash represent significant vulnerabilities.  Corruption enables and exacerbates money laundering.    Sources of illicit proceeds include tax evasion; fraud; trafficking in drugs, arms, and persons; prostitution; and cybercrime.  Illicit proceeds are laundered through real estate, insurance, financial and non-financial institutions, fictitious enterprises, gaming establishments, and bulk cash smuggling.    The State Financial Monitoring Service (SFMS), Ukraine’s FIU, submitted referrals to law enforcement related to the use of non-resident companies, inflated asset purchase prices, embezzlement at state-owned enterprises, tax evasion, and terrorism/separatism financing.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Ukraine has a sufficient legal framework for prosecution of money laundering and cooperation with international partners.  The SFMS monitors AML/CFT efforts and is capable of generating high-quality financial intelligence.    On April 28, 2020, a new AML law came into force, bringing Ukraine’s AML/CFT framework in line with EU legislation.  It mandates a risk-based approach, strengthens CDD, sets the CTR reporting threshold at approximately $14,100, improves disclosure of beneficial owners, adds new rules for PEPs, and significantly increases fines for failure to identify financial operations subject to financial monitoring.   On July 14, 2020, parliament passed the Law on Gambling, legalizing gaming in Ukraine after an 11-year ban.  The National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) performs AML/CFT compliance monitoring and surveillance of Ukraine’s banking system.  Inspections follow a risk-based approach.   The Asset Recovery Management Agency (ARMA) finds, traces, and manages assets derived from corruption and other crimes.    Ukrainian authorities exchange information on investigations of financial crimes with international partners through the SFMS.  Ukraine and the United States also have a bilateral MLAT.  The United States and Ukraine do not have a bilateral extradition treaty.    Ukraine is a member of MONEYVAL, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/publications/mutualevaluations/documents/mer-ukraine-2017.html.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  189  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Ukraine improved its criminal provisions regarding terrorism financing and sanctions for noncompliance with AML/CFT legislation.  International experts noted Ukraine needs to improve its financial sanctions related to terrorism and proliferation, regulation and supervision of DNFBPs, and maintenance of AML/CFT statistics.  The SFMS recommended to the Cabinet of Ministers of Ukraine improvements in the regulation of virtual asset transactions, real estate brokerages, and foreign trusts; registries of banking accounts and safe deposit boxes; and in the inspection of UBOs.  ARMA continues to experience serious challenges, especially in managing complex assets.  A comprehensive asset tracking system should be an urgent priority.    Supervisory authorities, other than banking and securities regulators, often appear unable or unwilling to verify whether covered entities are beneficially owned or controlled by criminal elements or their associates.  Significant improvements are required on the part of non-bank supervisory authorities, including the Stock Exchange Commission and Ministries of Justice, Finance, and Digitalization.  Improved AML regulation is also necessary for non-bank institutions.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Ukraine has made significant progress in addressing regulatory gaps involving financial institutions but limited progress in addressing other identified technical compliance deficiencies.    Ukraine should address fictitious entrepreneurship, the shadow economy, and the relatively high reliance on cash, all of which are considered significant money laundering risks.  The government also needs to address cross-border risks and risks posed by NPOs and legal persons.   The SFMS published Ukraine’s second money laundering/terrorist financing NRA in December 2019, as well as new guidelines for reporting entities.  Ukraine is working to implement an action plan to improve the effectiveness of the national financial monitoring system.      While the NABU and SAPO are taking actions against current senior PEPs for corruption, more successful prosecutions in cases involving high-level corruption and theft of state assets are needed.  External pressures, such as the recent CCU decisions, pose a more fundamental threat to Ukraine’s anticorruption institutional architecture.  According to the office of the General Prosecutor, in the first nine months of 2020, 268 allegations of money laundering were reported.  The state judicial administration reported 134 registered cases and 16 convictions for money laundering crimes in 2019.  In 2020, NABU reported 17 investigations for money laundering.  In addition, six criminal cases were sent to the High Anti-Corruption Court (HACC).  The HACC has not considered any money laundering cases since it began operation in September 2019.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  190  United Arab Emirates  OVERVIEW    The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a regional hub for trade and financial activity that has aggressively expanded its financial services business.  Illicit actors may take advantage of the open business environment and global transportation links.  Additionally, the overlapping yet distinct jurisdictional regimes for supervision and enforcement across the seven emirates and disparate commercial and financial free zones create exposure to regulatory arbitrage.  In recent years, the government has taken steps to enhance its AML/CFT program.  Relevant authorities need to streamline internal mechanisms to improve the interagency decision-making process, enhance efforts to investigate money laundering and terrorist financing, and proactively implement and enforce related laws.    VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   The UAE is a transshipment point for illegal narcotics and a pass-through for drug proceeds.  Funds are laundered primarily through banks, MVTS, dealers in precious metals and stones, and real estate.  The numerous exchange houses, hawaladars, and general trading companies increase potential for bulk cash smuggling, TBML, abuse of corporate structures, and the laundering of proceeds of foreign predicates.    Domestic public corruption contributes little, if anything, to money laundering.  The UAE has an extensive offshore sector, including two financial free zones (FFZs) and more than 37 FTZs.  The FTZs host over 5,000 multinational companies and thousands more individual trading companies.  FTZ companies are considered offshore for legal purposes.  Though UAE law prohibits shell companies and trusts, FTZs present a significant gap in regulatory oversight.  FTZs benefit from special tax, customs, and import regimes and are governed by their own regulatory framework.  FTZs are often a permissive environment for unidentified or under-supervised entities, such as general trading companies, to operate.  Because the FFZs and FTZs are independently regulated, the UAE’s federal authorities exercise limited oversight over these jurisdictions.    KEY AML LAWS, REGULATIONS  In April 2020, the chairmanship of the National Committee for Combating Money Laundering and the Financing of Terrorism and Illegal Organizations (NAMLCFTC) was taken over by the new governor of the Central Bank of the UAE (CBUAE).  AML/CFT efforts are further guided and coordinated by the higher committee overseeing the National Strategy for AML/CFT.    In 2020, UAE authorities issued several new AML/CFT regulations.  The UAE Securities and Commodities Authority issued Circular 1 (2020) to financial service companies and commodities exchanges covering procedures for freezing and unfreezing assets and requirements relative to UNSCRs and locally-designated individuals.  The UAE Insurance Authority issued \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  191  Resolution 19 (2020) to provide guidance to insurance companies and related professions on the proper submission of required information and reports.  The resolution also requires companies to establish AML/CFT compliance officers and policies and to submit periodic self-evaluation reports.  The UAE Council of Ministers issued Resolution 58 (2020) requiring declaration of beneficial ownership, shareholder disclosure, and timely updating of ownership information.  The resolution applies to all legal persons, including those within the FTZs, that meet stated control thresholds but does not cover companies incorporated in FFZs or companies owned by the local or federal government or their subsidiaries.     The UAE does not have a bilateral MLAT or extradition treaty with the United States.  However, the UAE is a party to several multilateral law enforcement conventions with mutual legal assistance provisions.    The UAE is a member of the MENAFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/countries/u-z/unitedarabemirates/documents/mer-uae-2020.html.     AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   The UAE’s role as an international financial center and commercial hub and its fragmented and uneven federal regulatory and enforcement regime present systemic vulnerabilities.  These vulnerabilities are most apparent throughout the vast exchange house sector, hawala networks, and unlicensed money transmitters, often operating under the guise of general trading companies.  These areas should be more tightly regulated under a centralized framework.    The UAE could strengthen oversight by publicly releasing metrics on money laundering and terrorist financing prosecutions and convictions.  International experts have criticized the UAE’s implementation of AML/CFT safeguards, particularly with respect to international cooperation, legal persons and arrangements, money laundering prosecution and conviction, and proliferation-related targeted financial sanctions.    The UAE’s FIU lacks specialized expertise and sufficient staff, undermining its mission to monitor STRs.     ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  In 2020, the CBUAE mandated hawaladars and informal money transfer service providers formally register with CBUAE in accordance with AML/CFT regulations.  CBUAE indicated legal action will be taken, including financial penalties and imprisonment, against hawala providers who fail to register their applications within 90 days.   UAE authorities arrested individuals involved in cyber fraud valued at $435.6 million; sentenced an accountant to prison and fined him $81,700 for abetting in money laundering; temporarily suspended 200 law firms and issued fines for failure to appoint AML/CFT compliance officers and complete AML/CFT questionnaires; and imposed financial penalties on two exchange houses for weak compliance with AML/CFT regulations.   \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  192  In September 2020, the NAMLCFTC, in collaboration with the Federal Authority for Nuclear Regulation, launched case-management software intended to integrate and aggregate information regarding the financing and proliferation of weapons of mass destruction across federal and local authorities, facilitating timely communication and action.  The platform should improve monitoring and investigative capacity.  Resources for the FIU should be increased.  Law enforcement at the emirate level and the federal security services should enhance their enforcement efforts.  Proactively developing money laundering cases and establishing appropriate asset forfeiture procedures would strengthen the local enforcement regime.  Additionally, officials should conduct more inquiries into large, cross-border cash flows.     United Kingdom   OVERVIEW  The UK is a global leader in combating illicit finance.  Money laundering presents a risk to the UK because of the size, sophistication, and reputation of its financial system.  UK law enforcement combats cash-based money laundering, the drug trade, and high-end money laundering through the financial sector and professional services.  The country continues to deliver its economic crime plan, including public and private sector reform.  The UK should strengthen the capabilities of the FIU, reduce inconsistencies in the supervisory regime, and increase its international reach to tackle money laundering.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Cash-based and high-end money laundering remain the greatest areas of risk to the UK.  The main methods of laundering are cash collection networks, international controllers, and money services businesses.  Criminals often use professional services to disguise the origins of funds, using legal, accountancy, and company service providers to set up corporate structures for laundering purposes.  Intelligence gaps persist, particularly regarding high-end money laundering, where proceeds are held in complex trading arrangements, real estate, or other non-cash investments.  Such methods are often used to launder the proceeds of major fraud and foreign corruption.  UK law enforcement agencies have taken steps to fill these gaps and better understand the risk.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The UK updated its money laundering/terrorist financing NRA in 2020.  Money laundering is criminalized and can be considered a component or predicate offense of more serious crime.  New tools, such as unexplained wealth orders (UWOs), help identify and recover assets linked to corruption and other serious offenses.  The UK has a comprehensive AML regime and participates in multilateral efforts to counter transnational financial crimes.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  193  The UK updated its AML regulations in January 2020 to implement the EU’s Fifth Money Laundering Directive.  This brought virtual assets, art market participants, and leasing agents under regulation.  The Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Act 2018 provides the legislative basis for the UK’s sanctions regime once it breaks final ties with the EU at the end of 2020.    The UK has led the push for beneficial ownership transparency and established registers containing information about persons who ultimately own or control UK assets, including companies, properties, land, and trusts.  The company register is public and has served as a model, but verification of the information remains a challenge.  The UK’s Crown Dependencies and permanently inhabited Overseas Territories have committed to adopting publicly accessible company beneficial ownership registers by 2023.  The UK exchanges information about potential shell companies suspected of being misused for money laundering purposes with foreign law enforcement and other authorities.  The UK is a member of the FATF.  Its most recent MER is available at:  http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/reports/mer4/MER-United-Kingdom-2018.pdf.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  The UK’s AML legal framework is strong.  International experts have identified areas for improvement, including the FIU’s insufficient resources and limited role, weaknesses in suspicious transaction reporting, and correspondent banking measures.  Improvements in risk-based supervision and implementation of AML measures within the private sector are needed.  The UK’s economic crime plan seeks to address these deficiencies.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  There are 25 AML supervisors of financial institutions and DNFBPs in the UK, ranging from public-sector statutory organizations to professional bodies.  The UK has a mandatory reporting process for supervisors.  The government maintains the Office for Professional Body AML Supervision to share best practices and ensure effective supervision.  In 2019, there were 1,342 prosecutions and 1,044 convictions for money laundering as the primary offense in England and Wales.  Statistics for Scotland and Northern Ireland are not available.  UK legislation provides for conviction- and non-conviction-based confiscation.  The UK maintains a publicly accessible register of company beneficial ownership information.  Companies that do not provide information are subject to penalties.  The UK is increasingly employing UWOs to require persons suspected of having links to serious crime and non-European Economic Area PEPs suspected of corruption to explain how they lawfully acquired their assets.  Since 2018, UWOs have been obtained in four cases – three cases remain active with an estimated total value of approximately $193.5 million (£143.2 million) as of March 31, 2020.  Notably, in December 2020, the UK supreme court upheld the first UWO issued under the legislation: one to Zamira Hajiyeva, the wife of a convicted chairman of the Bank of Azerbaijan, who reportedly spent more than $1 million per year at Harrods over more than a decade. \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  194   The National Economic Crime Centre, hosted within the National Crime Agency, was established in 2018 and coordinates the UK’s response to economic crime at home and abroad.  The multi-agency initiative comprises representatives from a variety of law enforcement and government departments.   The UK has been a leader in multilateral discussions and implementation of international asset recovery efforts involving proceeds of high-level corruption.  In July 2019, the United States and UK established the Strategic Dialogue on Illicit Finance to facilitate strategic and operationally focused discussions between the United States and UK on an interagency basis in order to combat money laundering cooperatively.   Uzbekistan   OVERVIEW  Uzbekistan’s efforts to implement international AML/CFT standards are hampered by corruption, a lack of interagency cooperation, frequent turnover of personnel, vulnerability to political influence, and insufficient technical expertise.  The government’s reluctance to share data on prosecutions makes it challenging to evaluate Uzbekistan’s AML/CFT progress.  Despite improvements in legislation, the general trend is one of stasis.  Recommendations include improving transparency and availability of AML/CFT data, improving technical expertise, using modern software for investigations, improving interagency collaboration, and strengthening working-level cooperation with other countries.   VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Illicit funds in Uzbekistan derive from endemic corruption, smuggling, and drug trafficking.  Uzbekistan borders all the Central Asian countries, as well as Afghanistan, and is situated on key trade routes, making the country vulnerable to extremist groups in neighboring countries and the illicit cross-border movement of drugs, goods, and cash.    Government oversight is avoided by hawala-type money transfers, electronic money, and large cash operations.  Bulk cash smuggling in foreign currencies occurs mainly on the borders with Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan.  The government believes large proceeds from tax and customs evasion are laundered through economic activities.  The registration of legal entities abroad is used for tax evasion and to conceal the identities of beneficial owners.  Illicit proceeds are often transferred to banks in offshore territories, mainly in Latvia and the British Virgin Islands, and then brought back to Uzbekistan under the guise of foreign investment.  By law, foreign exchange transactions with 69 offshore territories are monitored, including the British Virgin Islands but not Latvia.    Uzbekistan’s cash economy, high import tariffs, excessive bureaucracy, and remittances from migrants abroad pose additional challenges.  The securities, banking, and insurance industries \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  195  suffer from extensive government regulation and lack advanced technical capacity to combat money laundering.     KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  Uzbekistan’s KYC and STR regulations are reflected in the Law on Combating Legalization of Proceeds Obtained through Crime and Financing of Terrorism.  In October, the government initiated a new requirement for local banks to report on transfers abroad of more than $10,000 per month by residents.  Tax authorities introduced a more comprehensive monitoring mechanism to facilitate requests for information from taxpayers when suspicious or illegal foreign exchange transactions are detected.  The government also passed a new law requiring payment processing services, electronic money platforms, and individuals trading cryptocurrencies to conduct CDD, risk management for money laundering, and the detection of suspicious transactions.      A new anticorruption agency was established in 2020 and is developing anticorruption regulations for public agencies and a system of income and asset declaration for all public servants.  In October, the Prosecutor General’s Office proposed to amend the criminal code to permit the confiscation of illicit proceeds, money intended to finance extremism/terrorism, and the means used to commit crimes.  The State Customs Committee has proposed a draft law granting it authority to access bank information, currently protected by secrecy laws.  The Interdepartmental Commission on Countering the Legalization of Proceeds from Crimes and Terrorism Financing coordinates NRAs, analyzes national policies and practices, and develops recommendations for the further development and strengthening of the national AML system.  The commission’s activities are aimed at creating an effective mechanism for interaction among government bodies, self-regulatory organizations, and the private sector in countering the legalization of proceeds from crime, terrorist financing, and proliferation financing.  The Department for Combating Economic Crimes under the General Prosecutor's Office is a working body of the commission.   Uzbekistan is a member of the EAG, a FATF-style regional body. Its most recent MER is available at:  https://eurasiangroup.org/files/uploads/files/other_docs/ME/01.%20Mutual%20Evaluation%20Report%20on%20AMLCFT%20-%202010.pdf.   AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   Uzbekistan’s KYC and STR laws are not comprehensive and the country lacks regulations on asset recovery and confiscation, anticorruption safeguards for public procurement and the facilitation of payments, conflict of interest avoidance, liability of legal persons, and whistleblower protections.  There are requirements for EDD for PEPs based on a 2018 decree, though the requirements are vague and high-level officials often avoid punishment for exceeding their authority or other violations.  The investigation of serious cases of public corruption, abuse of power, and money laundering remains rare.    \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  196  The United States does not have a bilateral MLAT with Uzbekistan, although the latter has expressed an interest in such an agreement.  Uzbekistan’s MOUs with individual U.S. law enforcement bodies are mostly dormant as are its MOUs on cooperation in countering money laundering with 21 countries.     ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  The frequent turnover of staff, poor communication among agencies as well as with the financial sector, and the inability or reluctance of law enforcement to conduct investigations hinder the effective implementation of AML/CFT policies.  The government’s reluctance to share information related to investigations and prosecutions of AML/CFT crimes limits meaningful cooperation with other countries, though the government remains interested in receiving technical training from international donors.    Venezuela  OVERVIEW  Venezuela is characterized by rampant illicit financial activity and endemic public corruption, which continued to worsen throughout 2020.  Illegitimate president Nicolás Maduro and his regime rely on illicit activities – money laundering, drug trafficking, illegal mining, fraud, sanctions evasion, and public corruption – to help fund their illegitimate rule.    Venezuela’s proximity to drug-producing countries and its status as a significant drug transit country, combined with nonexistent AML supervision, enforcement, and international cooperation, make for a jurisdiction riddled with pervasive money laundering and financial crimes.  The economy remains deeply unstable and suffers from periods of severe hyperinflation.  The effective dollarization, in practice, of large swaths of the economy raises concerns about the source of those dollars and who has access to them.  Liberalizing the use of U.S. dollars in the Venezuelan economy, something which for years had been prohibited, is seen, for now, as the most expedient means of combating currency depreciation.    Ongoing U.S. federal criminal court cases point to billions of dollars laundered and embezzled by regime officials, with several cases advancing in 2020.  On March 26, 2020, U.S. federal indictments were unsealed against Maduro and 15 other regime officials for narco-terrorism and corruption.  Among these officials, regime supreme court president Maikel Moreno was charged with millions of dollars in money laundering.  In a separate indictment unsealed that same day, regime economic vice president Tareck El Aissami and superintendent of cryptocurrency Joselit Ramirez were charged with evasion of sanctions and money laundering.  The Department of State Rewards for Justice program issued awards for information pertaining to Maduro ($15 million), El Aissami ($10 million), Moreno ($5 million), and Ramirez ($5 million), and several other key regime officials.  El Aissami was designated pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act in 2017.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  197  There have been no improvements since FinCEN’s 2019 Updated Advisory on Widespread Public Corruption in Venezuela, which states the illegitimate Maduro regime engaged in massive corruption through state-owned enterprises and offshore third parties, contributing to the dire humanitarian situation in Venezuela.  FinCEN continues to assess that all Venezuelan regime-controlled agencies and bodies appear vulnerable to public corruption, money laundering, and other financial crimes, and the illegitimate Maduro regime uses its control of the economy to generate significant wealth for senior political figures and associates.  U.S. Presidential EO 13884, “Blocking Property of the Government of Venezuela,” addresses the continued usurpation of power by Maduro and persons affiliated with him as well as human rights abuses and the undermining of the interim government and the legitimately elected Venezuelan national assembly.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES  Money laundering is widespread in Venezuela, including through government currency exchanges, the petroleum industry, illegal mining, government contracts, and to a lesser extent, through commercial banks, gaming, real estate, agriculture, livestock, and securities.  TBML remains common and profitable.  Press reporting indicates hundreds of millions of dollars of gold and other metals were stolen from Venezuelan reserves and shipped to third countries in an attempt to skirt U.S. financial sanctions.  A robust black market continues to function in the porous border regions with Colombia, and to some extent Brazil, via the smuggling of commodities, including food staples and gas.    KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  The 2012 Organic Law Against Organized Crime and Financing of Terrorism, as revised in 2014, lacks important mechanisms to combat domestic criminal organizations, as it excludes the state and its companies from the scope of investigations.  The Maduro regime used AML and anticorruption laws as tools to suppress and intimidate political opposition, the private sector, and NGOs – including those that provide humanitarian assistance. Venezuela is a member of the CFATF, a FATF-style regional body.  Its most recent MER is available at:  https://www.cfatf-gafic.org/index.php/member-countries/venezuela.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES  Maduro regime entities responsible for combating money laundering and corruption are ineffective and lack political will.  Their technical capacity and willingness to address financial crimes remain deeply inadequate.  Further, regime authorities are complicit in financial crime.  A politicized judicial system further compromises the legal system’s effectiveness and impartiality.  Venezuela’s FIU, the National Financial Intelligence Unit (UNIF), is supervised by the Superintendent of Banking Sector Institutions, which prevents UNIF from operating independently.  FinCEN suspended information sharing with the UNIF in 2006 due to an unauthorized disclosure of shared information.  The suspension remains in effect until FinCEN has assurances its information will be protected.  The UNIF should operate autonomously, independent of undue influence.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  198  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  Venezuela’s foreign exchange system that allocates foreign exchange to the private sector remains an opaque system subject to manipulation by connected insiders.  The illegitimate Maduro regime maintains many off-budget accounts in foreign currencies that lack transparency and oversight, making them vulnerable to corruption.  For example, virtually all U.S. dollars laundered through Venezuela’s formal financial system pass through the government’s currency commission, the central bank, or another government agency.     Vietnam   OVERVIEW  Vietnam made minimal progress in reducing the risks of money laundering during 2020.  Systemic vulnerabilities, including extensive use of cash, minimal bank scrutiny on suspicious transactions, corruption, long and porous borders, and inadequate customs enforcement, combine with regulatory deficiencies and poor interagency coordination to hinder an effective AML regime.  Vietnam has made some improvements, including the issuance of several decrees and circulars that clarify how ministries should implement preexisting AML legislation.  The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) provided some training to relevant ministries on these new regulations.  Nevertheless, more needs to be done.  The Vietnamese government should prioritize the development of overall AML capabilities; improve coordination among SBV, the Ministry of Public Security, and the Ministry of Finance; and enhance communication between the government and banks.  VULNERABILITIES AND MONEY LAUNDERING METHODOLOGIES   Vulnerabilities include purchases of Vietnamese assets by foreign entities seeking to avoid tax obligations in their countries of origin, corruption, fraud, illegal gaming, prostitution, counterfeiting of goods, and trafficking in persons, drugs, and wildlife.  Remittances from Vietnamese organized crime groups abroad also represent vulnerabilities.  Vietnam remains a predominantly cash-based economy.  Consumers routinely purchase high-value items with cash, including real estate, investment stakes, and luxury items.  Foreign entities can easily transfer significant amounts of money into Vietnamese financial institutions and do not typically have to answer questions on the money’s provenance.  While Vietnam continues to have issues regarding the provenance of cash inflows, there is no indication financial institutions in Vietnam engage in currency transactions involving international narcotics trafficking proceeds that include significant amounts of U.S. currency or currency derived from illegal drug sales in the United States.  \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  199  The banking system remains vulnerable to money laundering through falsified declarations and customs fraud.  Over- and under-invoicing of imports and exports are not uncommon, and also represent a vulnerability to TBML.  In 2018, Vietnam granted its first pilot licenses to local casinos.  Currently, Vietnam has eight licensed casinos; all but one only serve foreign visitors.  In January 2019, the government initiated a three-year pilot program allowing Vietnamese nationals to gamble at one casino in Phu Quoc and will assess the outcome to determine whether additional casinos will be open to Vietnamese nationals in the future.  Authorities must ensure these establishments effectively implement and enforce AML standards.  Online gaming is illegal.  KEY AML LAWS AND REGULATIONS  In November 2019, the prime minister issued Decree 87, requiring any entity providing payment services to implement the same AML measures required of banks.  SBV’s Circular 20, issued concurrently with Decree 87, states any person entering or departing Vietnam with foreign or domestic currency, gems, or precious metals must have documentation proving lawful origins; the decree does not indicate a threshold for when documentation is required.  In July 2020, SBV hosted an online course to train other agencies on how to implement these directives.  Vietnam does not have an extradition treaty or MLAT with the United States, though Vietnam is a signatory to several multilateral conventions that permit international cooperation.  The U.S.-Vietnam Customs Mutual Assistance Agreement (CMAA), a legally binding information-sharing mechanism to facilitate the prevention, detection, and investigation of customs offenses, entered into force on May 20, 2020.  While the CMAA does not directly address money laundering, it enhances Vietnam’s ability to prevent illegal transshipment of goods and other contraband that could be used to launder money and facilitates the exchange of investigative information with appropriate U.S. authorities.    Vietnam is a member of the APG, a FATF-style regional body.  Vietnam’s most recent MER is available at:  http://www.apgml.org/includes/handlers/get-document.ashx?d=68a28c62-1ebe-41f7-8af6-e52ead79150c.  AML LEGAL, POLICY, AND REGULATORY DEFICIENCIES   While Vietnam’s laws comply with some international best practices on AML, the government needs to improve overall operational effectiveness by increasing coordination among ministries and communication with banks.  Regulations that require information from customers whose transactions originate abroad or may be suspicious are weakly enforced, and sometimes the government does not communicate changes in relevant legislation to banks operating in Vietnam.  Banks need to fully implement CDD and KYC guidelines.    Although Vietnam requires in- and outbound travelers to declare cash and other valuables, inconsistent enforcement, a lack of specificity in the law, and a lack of a universal declaration form facilitate the flow of illicit moneys into and out of Vietnam.  Vietnam also needs to \fINCSR 2021 Volume II                Money Laundering  200  improve its detection, interdiction, and prosecution of offenses related to bulk cash smuggling and trafficking of illegal narcotics, persons, and wildlife.    SBV’s FIU is not a member of the Egmont Group.  ENFORCEMENT/IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES AND COMMENTS  For Vietnam to make significant progress on AML, the country will need improved interagency communication and better international coordination.  Cumbersome bureaucratic procedures, including the fact that interagency coordination requires signed MOUs, impedes whole-of-government efforts.  A lack of resources hinders parallel money laundering investigations during predicate crime investigations.  Agencies are slow to change operating practices, and law enforcement entities often lack the capability to perform financial investigations.  Vietnam has a National AML/CFT Coordinating Committee and a national AML/CFT action plan for 2015-2020, but the government has not drafted a plan for the years beyond 2020.  During 2020, Vietnam investigated 28 people, all connected to one overall racketeering case, for money laundering offenses, but has not yet made a determination on prosecution.  \f\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t \t \t\t \t \t\t \t \tPrinted by A/GIS/GPS, March 2021",

Mr.Volodin, 41, had little choice: Thecar factory closed down in March,joining more than 1,000 multi-national companies that had cur-tailed operations in Russia be-cause of its invasion of Ukraine.Since then, he has been sittingat home while Volkswagen looksfor a buyer. He goes into the plant,in Kaluga’s industrial zone, once amonth to collect 50,000 rubles,about $800, a payment requiredby Russian labor law that is theequivalent of two-thirds of his pre-vious salary.“We go into work, but the plantstands empty,” Mr. Volodin said inan interview. He does not mind atemporary break from the physi-cally demanding work, but he isnot sure how to plan for the future.“We live day to day, for now,” hesaid.His experience is playing outacross Russia for hundreds ofthousands of workers after theWest imposed sweeping economicsanctions that were intended tohobble Moscow’s ability to wagewar and to undercut public sup-port for President Vladimir V.Putin.More than nine months afterthe invasion, neither the war ef-fort nor the economy has col-lapsed, and the economic pain isstill limited for many Russians.Mr. Putin has avoided any sub-stantive domestic pressure thatwould threaten his leadership.But the impact of what some havedescribed as the most coordinatedand deepest economic sanctionsin modern history is evident incommunities across Russia — andthe worst may be yet to come.The sanctions have stymiedRussia’s faltering attempts tomodernize its economy alongWestern lines and to catch up toEuropean living standards afterthe fall of the Soviet Union, saidVladislav Inozemtsev, the Wash-ington-based director of the Cen-ter for Post-Industrial Studies, aRussian research group. That hasdimmed the hope that the countrycould become a modern, prosper-ous nation in the near term.“The slogan now is ‘Keep thingsfrom getting worse,’ and that’s animportant shift,” Mr. Inozemtsevsaid. “Even the government hasstopped betting on national devel-opment.”Beneath the veneer of nor-malcy, he said, key drivers ofgrowth, like technology transferand investment, are eroding. “It’slike a cake that was dropped onthe table and it looks more or lessfine, but inside it’s all blown up,’’Mr. Inozemtsev said.The most visible and dramatic WAR’S SANCTIONS SLOWLY UNDERCUTRUSSIAN ECONOMYPROGRESS THREATENEDRestrictions Have StalledMoscow’s Attempts toModernizeBy VALERIE HOPKINSand ANATOLY KURMANAEVContinued on Page A8A senior Iranian official saidthis weekend that Iran had abol-ished the morality police, the statemedia reported, after months ofprotests set off by the death of ayoung woman who was detainedby the force for supposedly vio-lating the country’s strict Islamicdress laws.The morality police were “abol-ished by the same authorities whoinstalled it,” Attorney General Mo-hammad Javad Montazeri said onSaturday during a meeting atwhich officials were discussingthe unrest, according to state me-dia reports.It was unclear whether thestatement amounted to a final de-cision by the theocratic govern-ment, which has neither an-nounced the abolition of the mo-rality police nor denied it.But if the force is abolished, thechange will be unlikely to appeaseprotesters who are still clashingwith other security forces andhave become so emboldened thatsome are calling for an end of theIslamic Republic.The morality police are over-seen by the Iranian police, not theattorney general, and there weresuggestions that the governmentmight be trying to play down thesignificance of Mr. Montazeri’s re-marks.One state television channel,the Arabic-language Al Alam, saidthat the comments had been takenout of context, and other statechannels said the governmentwas not backing down from themandatory hijab law.Iran’s foreign minister, HosseinAmir Abdollahian, when askedabout the abolishment of the mo-rality police at a news conferencein Belgrade, Serbia, where he wason an official visit, did not deny it,but said, “In Iran, everything ismoving forward well in the frame-work of democracy and freedom.”For his part, Mr. Montazeri alsosaid on Saturday that the judicia-ry would still enforce restrictionson “social behavior.” Days earlier,he said that the authorities werereviewing the law requiring wom-Cracks in Iran?Morality PoliceAre Said to End.By VIVIAN YEEand FARNAZ FASSIHIContinued on Page A6LITTLETON, Colo. — Ten yearsago, a Colorado baker named JackPhillips turned away a gay couplewho had asked him for a weddingcake, saying that a state law for-bidding discrimination based onsexual orientation must yield tohis faith.The dispute, a white-hot flashpoint in the culture wars, made itto the Supreme Court. But JusticeAnthony M. Kennedy’s narrowmajority opinion in 2018 did notsettle the question of whether theFirst Amendment permits dis-crimination by businesses open tothe public based on their owners’religious convictions. Indeed, theopinion acknowledged that thecourt had merely kicked the candown the road and would have todecide “some future controversyinvolving facts similar to these.”That controversy has now ar-rived, and the facts are indeedsimilar. A graphic designer namedLorie Smith, who works just a fewmiles from Mr. Phillips’s bakery,Masterpiece Cakeshop, has chal-lenged the same Colorado law onthe same grounds.“He’s an artist,” Ms. Smith saidof Mr. Phillips. “I’m also an artist.We shouldn’t be punished for cre-ating consistently with our con-victions.”The basic arguments in thecase, which will be made beforethe Supreme Court on Monday,are as familiar as they are polariz-ing.On one side are people who saythe government should not forcethem to violate their principles tomake a living. On the other aresame-sex couples and others whosay they are entitled to equaltreatment from businesses opento the public.Both sides say that the conse-quences of the court’s ruling couldbe enormous, though for differentreasons.

Security Council, he com-pared Russian forces to the Is-lamic State, called for a Nurem-berg-like war crimes tribunal andvented his bitter frustration,knowing that the council — whereRussia is one of five permanentmembers with veto power —would do nothing but talk.“Where is the security that theSecurity Council needs to guaran-tee?” Mr. Zelensky said, raisingthe question of whether Russiadeserved to keep its seat on thecouncil. “Are you ready to closethe U.N.?

Somevictims, their hands bound, hadbeen shot in the head.Mr. Zelensky said that in Bucha,“they killed entire families, adultsand children, and they tried toburn the bodies.” Civilians “werecrushed by tanks while sitting intheir cars in the middle of theroad,” he added, asserting that“women were raped and killed infront of their children; theirtongues were pulled out.”China refrained from criticizingRussia in Tuesday’s session, say-ing that the Security Councilshould wait until investigationsestablish the facts in Ukraine.

Today, this policy provides a powerful response to the issues of corporate ethical responsibility in general, as well as the role a group like LVMH should play within French society and internationally.Our philosophy: Passionate about creativity\f2  •  3T H E  VA LU E S  O F  A  D E E P LY C O M M I T T E D  G R O U PBeing creative and innovativeCreativity and innovation are part of LVMH’s DNA; throughout the years, they have been the keys to our Maisons’ success and the basis of their solid reputa-tions. These fundamental values of creativity and innovation are pursued in tandem by our Group’s Maisons as they focus on achieving the ideal balance between continually renewing their offer while resolutely looking to the future, always respecting their unique heritage.Delivering excellenceWithin the Group, quality can never be compromised. Because the Maisons embody everything that is most noble and accomplished in the world of fine craftsmanship, they pay extremely close attention to detail and strive for ­perfection: from products to services, it is in this quest for excellence that the Group differentiates itself. Cultivating an entrepreneurial spiritThe Group’s agile, decentralized structure fosters efficiency and responsive-ness. It encourages individuals to take initiative by giving everyone a significant level of responsibility. The entrepreneurial spirit promoted by the Group makes risk-taking easier and encourages perseverance. It requires a pragmatic approach and the ability to motivate staff to achieve ambitious goals. Taking action to make a differenceEvery action taken by the Group and its employees reflects our commitment to ethics, corporate social responsibility and respect for the environment. They drive our Maisons’ performance and ensure their longevity. Firmly convinced that truly desirable products can only come from sustainable businesses, we are committed to ensuring that our products and the way they are made have a positive impact on our entire ecosystem and the places we operate, and that our Group is actively working to build a better future.\fLouis Vuitton, Towards a Dream, Jordan\f4  •  5\tT H E  LV M H  G R O U P6 \tChairman’s message12 \tInterview with the Group Managing Director14 \tRobust corporate governance16 \tMaisons with a strong identity17 \tA diverse range of professions18 \tThe world’s leading luxury goods group 20 \tA responsible model dedicated to excellence 22 \tExemplary ethics and responsibility 24 \tSupporting culture, young people and humanitarian projects28 \tA firm commitment to support humanitarian and social causes30 \tA year of heightened social commitment 34 \tLIFE 360: Aiming for sustainable excellence40 \tLVMH and its Maisons take action \tB U S I N E S S  G R O U P  I N S I G H T S44 \tWines & Spirits64 \tFashion & Leather Goods86 \tPerfumes & Cosmetics106 \tWatches & Jewelry126 \tSelective Retailing142 \tCulture & Lifestyle\tP E R F O R M A N C E  M E A S U R E S154 \tStock market performance measures 156 \tFinancial performance measures158 \tNon-financial performance measures\f\fLVMH 2021  .  C h a i r m a n’s  m e s s a g e6  •  7S T E A D FA S T  A N D D E T E R M I N E D LVMH NAVIGATED THE UNCERTAINTIES OF 2021  WITHOUT EVER DEVIATING FROM ITS LONG-TERM COURSE: EXCELLENCE, CREATIVITY AND COMMITMENT.  OUR MAISONS’ LEADERSHIP HAS EMERGED STRONGER  FROM THIS CRISIS. LVMH HAS STEPPED UP ITS WORLDWIDE  SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY PROGRAMS  AND IS APPROACHING 2022 WITH DETERMINATION. LVMH achieved a remarkable performance in 2021. In a year that was once again heavily affected by the pandemic, thanks to our teams’ hard work and unflagging enthusiasm – which I wholeheartedly applaud – our Group more than weathered the storm. Our results are excellent: we delivered strong growth that surged even higher in the fourth quarter, and we continued to expand our ever-growing lead. If I may draw a parallel with cycling: the Tour de France is not won on the flats in fine weather, but on the steepest slopes, ­facing storms and headwinds – that’s when the champions pull ahead. With their boundless creativity, our Fashion & Leather Goods Maisons – Louis Vuitton and Christian Dior in particular – accomplished the extraordinary feat of gaining market share despite very turbulent conditions. Hennessy success-fully overcame major supply shortages to satisfy ever-increasing demand. Parfums Christian Dior continued to shine with the spectacular success of Sauvage, which became the world’s best-selling fragrance in 2021. Having just joined the LVMH family, and under the impetus of its new management team, Tiffany & Co. posted a record year. Our retail activities, which were directly impacted by the lockdowns and forced store closures in 2020, bounced back strongly, particularly at Sephora. S H O W C A S I N G  O U R  TA L E N TThe bedrock of our success is, of course, our Maisons’ talented employees. Whatever the circumstances, our exceptionally adaptable, prolifically creative staff rise to the challenge. All of the Group’s professions are just as focused on tradition as on the future, respecting their heritage of craftsmanship while forging ahead through new designs and new experiences.Louis Vuitton’s two new Vendôme workshops – the first located in one of the old town’s most beautiful historic buildings, the second at a contemporary site outside the center – work hand in hand and are a symbolic illustration of this duality. That mindset is also reflected in our investments: our Maisons’ workshops are locally rooted and benefit the economies of all the regions of France; our creative directors, like Maria Grazia Chiuri for Dior in Athens and Hedi Slimane for Celine in Nice, design collections and runway shows that inspire and touch “ LVMH navigated the  uncertainties of 2021 without ever deviating from its  long-term course: excellence, creativity and commitment.”\fthe entire planet; our engineers and sales assistants are inventing the digital experiences of the future and new ways of welcoming customers in our stores – which have never been so enterprising. For me, this is the hallmark of our Group and the stamp of fine craftsmanship: at the intersection of art and technology, culture and business, past and future. It’s a delicate balance: a harmonious, unified blend of ideas and dedication that harnesses artistic creativity, finely honed craftsmanship and organizational precision.It would be unthinkable, at this point, not to mention Virgil Abloh, who passed away so tragically and much too soon in 2021. The entire LVMH family is in mourning. He was a visionary, a beautiful soul and a very wise man. I know that his creative legacy will live on in the memory of our Group, just as departed masters continue to inspire up-and-coming generations of designers.B U I L D I N G  T H E  A R C H I T E C T U R A L  M A S T E R W O R K S  O F  D R E A M SAs you know, our Group has an illustrious history of constructing iconic build-ings all over the world, foremost among which is the Fondation Louis Vuitton. One of the key milestones of 2021 was the inauguration of La Samaritaine, the emblematic Paris department store, now restored to its former splendor 15 years after its closure and refurbishment. As soon as it reopened in June, this historic building once again found its place in the hearts of both Parisians and visitors to the City of Light. Since then, several million people have flocked to it, both to shop and to delight in rediscovering this French architec-tural landmark that LVMH has brought back to life. The Cheval Blanc Paris hotel, with its stunning views of the Seine and unparalleled service – which is without equal anywhere in the world – is also hugely successful. Its three restaurants have rapidly become essential destinations on the Paris fine-dining scene, in ­particular Plénitude, the gourmet restaurant run by chef Arnaud Donckele. These triumphs reflect LVMH’s goal, which is to look beyond the ups and downs of 2021 at these long-term projects, patiently completed despite being delayed by the pandemic and hailed as a return to happier times as soon as they opened to the public. We live in an often uncertain world and our project schedules can sometimes encounter unforeseen twists and turns, but that only magnifies the feeling of joy when they come to fruition. So come what may, we will never shy away from undertaking ambitious projects and aiming for long-term success. In this same spirit, Dior’s original store at Paris’ 30 avenue Montaigne reopened at the beginning of 2022 after an extensive revamp. This exceptional location, where the Maison’s legacy and creativity are showcased like never before, has already become a powerful focal point for visitors from all over the world. U N F L AG G I N G  C O M M I T M E N T  T O  T H E  P L A N E T  A N D  YO U N G  P E O P L E We focus on the long term and our commitments reflect this approach. Indeed, our quest for excellence and performance would not be complete without the unstinting and ever-growing daily efforts to make our corporate social responsibility a tangible reality. Preserving the environment, especially, is a priority: nature is the very substance of our products, and protecting it is essential to our Maisons’ long-term future.“ The bedrock of our success  is, of course, our Maisons’ talented employees. Whatever the circumstances, our  exceptionally adaptable,  prolifically creative staff  rise to the challenge.”\fLVMH 2021  .  C h a i r m a n’s  m e s s a g e8  •  92021 saw an array of remarkable achievements in this area. Moët & Chandon is now driving the necessary transition to sustainable winegrowing across the Champagne region, while Château Cheval Blanc is the world’s first grand cru to introduce agroecology – it has planted 4,000 trees in its vineyards and stimulates life on its unique terroir. Our Maisons are also making rapid progress towards a circular economy: Louis Vuitton’s Upcycling collection is made entirely from recycled materials, Loewe’s Surplus Project bags designed by Jonathan W. Anderson are made with leather offcuts, and Zenith has ­partnered with Nona Source to transform excess fabrics into watch straps.We involve our suppliers closely in this approach with an increasingly compre-hensive traceability system. Fendi now provides a full list of its Tier 1 suppliers. Guerlain shares the same commitment to transparency with its Bee Respect platform, which publicly discloses the origin and lifecycle of its products’ ingre-dients and packaging materials. LIFE 360, our ambitious Group-wide environ-mental program, coordinates and fleshes out our Maisons’ initiatives to preserve biodiversity and rapidly reduce CO₂ emissions. Lastly, our focus on natural resources is matched only by the attention we devote to preserving our intangible heritage: the professions and expertise we pass on to future generations. Over the next few months, we plan to hire about 25,000 people under 30. We will also put a lot of effort into training these new recruits, particularly through our Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME), which now has all the trappings of a full-fledged international university for craft professions and customer experience – it is present in six countries and offers 35 highly demanding programs. IME has trained 1,500 talented students since its launch, many of whom are now working with the Group’s Maisons.C O N F I D E N T,  P R U D E N T,  C A R I N GWith the pandemic yet to be fully resolved, 2022 has started with another crisis. We are closely following the dramatic events unfolding in Ukraine. It's very hard to predict how the geopolitical situation will evolve over the coming weeks and its precise impact on the global economy. In the short term, our people and operations are prepared and ready to face any emergency, just as we were at the height of the pandemic. In the longer term, we will continue to move forward with resolve and determination.From our vantage point, with our values and resources, we have a role to play in making the world a better place. Our passion for excellence, our creativity and our commitment go a long way towards achieving this goal. So do our sense of community, which is closely linked to our Group’s family values; and our dynamic entrepreneurial spirit, which has permeated the Group since its inception. In 2021, we celebrated the 200th anniversary of Louis Vuitton’s birth and it is worth remembering his life journey, leaving the Jura Mountains for Paris to found what would become the world’s foremost luxury brand. In his story, I see a parable of the unstoppable power of entrepreneurship. I hope his example will continue to guide us and enable us to view the future with hope. For LVMH, this is still just the beginning.Bernard ArnaultChairman and Chief Executive Officer“ From our vantage point, with our values and resources, we have a role  to play in making  the world a better place.”\fLa Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf\f\fC O N F I D E N C E ,  V I G I L A N C E  A N D  E N G AG E M E N T Antonio Belloni, Group Managing DirectorLVMH achieved a record-breaking  performance in 2021: how do you explain  such a success despite ongoing disruptions related to the public health situation?Our performance was driven by a combination of factors, both external and internal. First, our customers’ mindset: after living through two years of the pandemic, they want to rediscover the joy of shopping, enjoy memorable experiences and reconnect. There’s also a clear desire to focus on fundamentals – tried-and-true essentials with solid value and quality you can count on. We saw the same thing happen during the crises in 2001 and 2008, which ultimately made our Group stronger: our brands are, by nature, positioned to reap the benefits.But that only explains part of our success: the other part comes from our long-term focus on our fundamental strategic priorities. Patiently working to craft our Maisons’ brand image and build their appeal. Maintaining ongoing ­dialogue and feedback to allow our decentralized ­organization to swiftly adapt to any situation. Investing in our capacity to innovate and create unprecedented experiences, in particular to prepare for our customers’ return to our stores while maintaining our momentum in online sales. Keeping our eye firmly on the future so our Maisons win over a younger clientele, while maintaining their timeless craftsmanship. I have been deeply impressed by how hard our teams have worked, and deeply grateful for their steadfast ­commitment in these trying times, despite multiple ­constraints and highly unpredictable circumstances: more than ever before, their agility and creativity have made all the difference.As the world is starting to see signs of  a possible end to the pandemic, what are  the most fundamental trends that the LVMH Group and its Maisons will face?Several lasting trends will continue to influence our busi-ness activities. The first is an increase in local demand. With tourist travel only slowly recovering, customers are tending to make more of their purchases in their own countries, so our sales associates are working to build \fLVMH 2021  .  I n t e r v i e w  w i t h  t h e  G r o u p  M a n a g i n g  D i r e c t o r12  •  13closer, more lasting customer relationships in each local market. It’s a virtuous circle. While our Maisons and prod-ucts will keep taking a global approach, we will also keep paying attention to the different customer bases and ­cultural specificities of each region.Another key trend that’s here to stay is digital, which is how most of our customers stay informed, share and shop. That’s not about to change, even with the return of the in-store experience. To leverage this trend, our brands must be able to cohesively express their unique values and their creative identity across a range of customer touchpoints, both physical and digital.Another increasingly important focus is the role of good corporate citizenship. In a complex, fragmented world, our responsibility has never been greater. And the same can be said of our power to make a difference: by making our manufacturing processes more and more sustainable, rising to meet younger generations’ aspirations for find-ing meaning in their work, and reducing inequality and prejudice that belong in the past. Lastly, our organization must be open to change in order to adapt to fundamental shifts in the world around us and prepare for the future. That means bringing in new skills, empowering local teams, breaking down silos, flexibly navigating in-person and virtual interactions, and more. Not to mention the key priority of passing on our Mai-sons’ creative legacy and excellent craftsmanship to the next generation. Through initiatives like the Institut des Métiers d’Excellence and Artisans 4.0, we’re doing more than just preserving our exceptional skills: we’re readying them for the future.  What’s the Group’s mindset going into 2022?Confident and determined, because we know we can count on our people. Our energy remains focused on the appeal of all of our Maisons, with many highlights ahead, including inspiring innovations at Louis Vuitton and the reopening of Christian Dior’s historic flagship at 30 avenue Montaigne in Paris and Tiffany’s on Fifth Avenue in New York.We will of course remain vigilant. Given the current geo-political crisis and ongoing pandemic-related disruptions, we will maintain our flexible, rigorous management approach. One of our priorities will be relaunching our activities most exposed to the travel industry, which will only see a very gradual recovery: our customers are eager to get back out and explore the world, but substantial restrictions remain in place.One thing is certain: we’re going to engage more closely than ever before with our partners to support them and work side by side. From our own workshops to our sup-pliers, our exceptional craftspeople and the world’s most innovative startups, we are part of a vast ecosystem, and this interconnectedness and dialogue are key to sparking new ideas and enhancing quality and efficiency. That’s what our Maisons’ success – and our Group’s performance – will always be built on.

Codes of ethics and their applicationLVMH’s wide-ranging commitments to our employees and stakeholders are reflected in the Group’s longstanding support for benchmark initiatives such as the United Nations Global Compact, and in the adoption of internal charters and codes of conduct which serve as guidelines for all of our Maisons. These include the LVMH Code of Conduct, the Supplier Code of Conduct, the Environmen-tal Charter and, more recently, the Animal-Based Raw Materials Sourcing Charter. The Group has a dedicated governance structure that ensures its values and codes of ethics are applied at the operating level. This structure includes the Ethics & Sustainable Development Committee, which operates within the Board of Directors. The Committee receives regular reports from the Group’s Ethics & Compliance Department which, with its network of over 80 officers, develops and implements the compliance program across all the Maisons.The Group puts these commitments and values into practice across all its business lines, paying close atten-tion to areas such as promoting employee inclusion and well-being; developing and passing on expertise and key skills; protecting personal data; reducing the Group’s impact on ecosystems and natural resources; implement-ing compliance systems; and establishing and maintaining responsible supply chains. In 2021, the Group extended access to LVMH Alert Line – our online whistleblowing platform – to all our external stakeholders. This platform was already open to employ-ees, who can use it to report in good faith any violations of laws, rules or in-house codes of conduct securely and confidentially.Fair and responsible relations  with our partnersSupporting our partners is a key strategic priority for LVMH, as we aim to build long-term relationships underpinned by our shared quest for excellence and the ambition to establish a set of common ethical principles, guidelines and practices. The Group is developing a comprehensive policy with the aim of ensuring that our partners and suppliers adopt best environmental, social and societal practices, while enhancing awareness and providing information about issues specific to their own activities. LVMH and its Maisons take a collaborative approach, offering support through audits and, where necessary, action plans. Over 1,500 audits were conducted in 2021. Despite the exceptional public health situation that began in early 2020, LVMH was able to maintain a significant level of on-site supplier audits. The Group’s responsible sourcing policy also includes supplier support and train-ing. For example, LVMH is a signatory of the Utthan pact, an initiative that brings together several luxury brands that contract out embroidery work. This program aims to empower artisans in Mumbai’s hand embroidery cluster, where many of the embroiderers partnering with the ­Maisons are based. The initiative also includes a training program for embroiderers. In addition, several of the Group's Maisons worked together to organize online training for managers of supplier sites in Italy and China. Given the results of the risk analysis and of certain audits, these training courses focused on human rights, health and safety, the environment and fighting corruption. \f\fLVMH 2021  .

THROUGH ITS SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY-ORIENTED INITIATIVES,  THE GROUP EXPRESSES ITS CREATIVE AND HUMANITARIAN VALUES AND STRIVES  TO PROMOTE CULTURAL HERITAGE, ART, FASHION AND ARTS EDUCATION FOR ALL.Culture, heritage and contemporary  creative arts In 2021, LVMH continued to back the effort to save Notre-Dame de Paris Cathedral, whose restoration will take ­several more years. Just one day after the terrible fire that ravaged the monument in the spring of 2019, LVMH, led by its Chairman, Bernard Arnault, made a €100 million donation (along with an additional €100 million from his family group) to ensure that Notre-Dame’s long restora-tion process is followed through to completion. In support of the arts, LVMH signed on to sponsor a new production of Tennessee Williams’ The Glass Menagerie at the Théâ-tre de l’Odéon, directed by Ivo van Hove. With its perfor-mances interrupted by the pandemic lockdown, this play was presented again in 2021, once again thanks to the support of LVMH. LVMH has been a loyal patron of the Nuit Blanche night-time arts festival for nearly fifteen years, and once again in 2021 provided support alongside the City of Paris to the French and international arts scene, giving center stage to contemporary artists at an event open to all in the heart of Paris. LVMH also continued its support for the Giacometti Institute in Paris, helping it develop its scientific and cultural program.Due to the Covid-19 pandemic, the final event for the eighth edition of the LVMH Prize for Young Fashion Designers was held without an in-person audience. Out of nine finalists, the LVMH Prize was awarded to Nensi Dojaka, a 27-year-old Albanian designer based in London who founded the eponymous women’s ready-to-wear fashion brand. She won a 300,000 euro award and a year of mentoring within the LVMH Group. The panel of judges also decided to award the Karl Lagerfeld Prize to three designers: Colm Dillane, the 29-year-old American founder of Brooklyn-based brand KidSuper; Lukhanyo Mdingi, a 29-year-old South African designer based in Cape Town; and Rui Zhou, a 26-year-old Chinese designer who founded Shanghai-based brand Rui.Arts education initiativesOnce again this year, LVMH’s patronage of programs for young people focused on music. In particular, LVMH renewed its support for Orchestre à l’École, a nonprofit that enables hundreds of children all over France to start playing a musical instrument. The Group also continued its actions to promote access for young people to perfor-mances at the Opéra Comique in Paris. LVMH also once again loaned out the Stradivariuses in its collection. Backing medical research  and certain social causesThe Group supported numerous institutions well known for their work with children, the elderly and people with disabilities, and for their efforts to combat major causes of suffering and exclusion. In particular, LVMH provided major support to the Fondation des Hôpitaux de Paris-­Hôpitaux de France and the Association Le Pont Neuf in France; Save the Children Japan; and the Robin Hood Foundation in New York, which works to support initia-tives for children. It also supported the Fondation Claude Pompidou, which provides support in France for seniors and people with disabilities; Association Fraternité ­Universelle, which works in Haiti to improve access to health care and education alongside actions in favor of agricultural development, especially in the Central Plateau; and the Curie Institute in its research and work to fight childhood cancer. The Group is also a longstanding sup-porter of a number of scientific teams and foundations engaged in cutting edge public health research.\fThe Fondation Louis Vuitton, which opened in 2014, is now recognized as a leading institution on the global arts scene, achieving remarkable success among both art and culture connoisseurs as well  as a wide French and international audience.In 2020, following the success of the Charlotte Perriand: Inventing a New World exhibition, which welcomed a total of 476,000 visitors, the Cindy Sherman at the Fondation exhibition, whose opening was postponed due to the pandemic, finally opened its doors to the public on September 23, 2020. This exceptional retrospective, featuring more than 170 works by Cindy Sherman, spanned her entire career as one of the greatest photographers of our time, with a special focus on works from the past decade, some of which were exhibited for the first time ever. As soon as the Fondation ­reopened, visitors flocked to admire this universally acclaimed artist’s insightful, sensitive exploration of the notions of identity and image until the public health crisis worsened and the Fondation closed for a second time on October 29, 2020.Throughout 2021, the pandemic upended the activities of cultural institu-tions. The Fondation Louis Vuitton demonstrated agility in continuing to pursue its core missions: supporting artists and building a dialogue between key figures in modern art, leading lights of the international ­contemporary art scene and a wide audience, especially young people.The Morozov Collection: Icons of Modern Art, an exhibition initially due to be held in October 2020, ultimately opened on September 22, 2021, and by February 2022 had already drawn more than 1 million visitors. This highly anticipated exhibition, which has received unanimous praise from the art world, features masterpieces from the collection of European and Russian modern art assembled by the Muscovite brothers Mikhail Abramovich Morozov (1870-1903) and Ivan Abramovich Morozov (1871-1921). Presented for the first time outside Russia, The Morozov Collection echoes the 2016 Shchukin exhibition, which marked an unprecedented new era in the partnership between the Fondation Louis Vuitton and major Russian museums.A final highlight was the Fondation Louis Vuitton’s continuation of its ­international Hors-Les-Murs (“Beyond the Walls”) program this year, with a number of exhibitions held at its Espace Louis Vuitton locations in Tokyo, Munich, Venice, Beijing, Seoul and Osaka.\fFondation Louis Vuitton\fA Louis Vuitton for UNICEF Reporter interacting with the Rohingya children of the Cox's Bazar refugee camp in Bangladesh in 2018\fLVMH 2021  .

IN THIS WAY, THE GROUP IS ABLE TO LEVERAGE ITS SUCCESS  AND EXCELLENCE TO DRIVE SHARED GROWTH, PROMOTE SOCIAL INTEGRATION AND CREATE JOBS, APPLYING ITS RESOURCES AND SKILLS TO INITIATIVES THAT SERVE THE GREATER GOOD.Supporting job creation,  entrepreneurship and regional developmentLVMH helps drive economic growth and social develop-ment around the world, in all the Group’s operating regions, both directly at its own sites and indirectly at its partners’ locations. It has launched a raft of initiatives and pays taxes in the countries and regions where it carries out its activities. The LVMH Group is a longstanding supporter of entre-preneurship. In early 2018, to help connect open innova-tion and business development with new ways of learning, the Group launched La Maison des Startups in France. This startup accelerator for the luxury industry is housed at Station F, the world’s largest startup campus. In the United States, Sephora joined the Fifteen Percent Pledge, an initiative that asks businesses to dedicate 15% of their shelf space to Black-owned brands, a target which was met starting in 2021.Facilitating access to employment  and social inclusion for people who have been marginalized on the job market As a major employer in many labor markets, LVMH pays close attention to each region’s specific employment ­situation. To promote social inclusion and employment for people who have been marginalized on the job mar-ket, the Group and its Maisons have forged partnerships with nonprofits and NGOs including Nos Quartiers ont des Talents in France, United Way of NYC in the United States and Daughters of Tomorrow in Asia.  Facilitating employment for people  with disabilities LVMH also takes action to promote inclusion and access to employment for people with disabilities. The Group works with organizations that specialize in training young people with disabilities and fostering social integration and access to employment. In France, it is a co-founder of ARPEJEH, a nonprofit organization that brings together around a hundred companies to guide young people with disabilities in their careers. In the United States, it supports Runway of Dreams, which works to promote employ-ment in the fashion world for people with disabilities. Promoting access to education  for young people and helping those in needLVMH aims to put the renowned excellence of its Maisons – the very foundation of their success – to work in support of equal opportunity and wider access to education for young people. The Maisons have developed numerous partnerships with schools located near their sites and further afield. LVMH encourages access to higher education for all students – whatever their social origins, family situation or ethnic background – through its multiple partnerships with schools. LVMH and its Maisons are committed to helping disad-vantaged communities in the regions where they operate. Their contribution may take the form of employee involve-ment, product donations or financial support. UNICEF and Save the Children are among the international non-profits supported by the Group’s Maisons. LVMH also supports efforts to combat sickle cell anemia through its partnerships with the Robert-Debré Hospital in Paris and the American Red Cross.\fLa Samaritaine Paris Pont-Neuf, which reopened in June 2021,  is revitalizing Paris’ right bank with nearly 3,000 jobs, reflecting  LVMH’s positive impact on the local economy. Every day, 1,700 employees  work to provide a unique experience to each and every visitor.\fLVMH 2021  .

Our employees are highly committed to the Group, and listen-ing to them and providing them with a safe, stimulating work environment is a top priority. We see this mutual commitment as a virtuous circle that reflects and rein-forces our team spirit and sense of community. Just as we feel that, as leaders in our industry, it is only natural for us to reach out to those whose lives may, at times, have been rocked by adversity. With current economic condi-tions proving especially challenging for young people, LVMH has boosted its human resources initiatives aimed at this group, particularly with regard to training, access to employment and social responsibility. Supporting our employeesIn 2021, LVMH launched a powerful initiative to support its employees: the LVMH Heart Fund. This fund – the only one of its kind in the world – offers financial, social and psychological support to all Group employees, wherever they are located, to help them get through the most diffi-cult periods of their personal lives. This initiative addresses both the expectations voiced by employees in response to the Pulse Survey carried out within the Group in 2020, and the need to be there for and support our employees facing challenging circumstances amid an unprece-dented economic and social context. In the seven months since its launch, the LVMH Heart Fund has already received 1,300 applications from 40 countries.The well-being of our employees remained front and center, with the signing of LVMH’s Health and Safety Charter by all Executive Committee members and Maison Presidents. This charter bolsters the Group’s approach to occupational health and safety through 2024 and aims to develop a self-reinforcing “zero accident” culture. For many years, LVMH has also worked to ensure that all of its employees are given equal opportunity throughout their careers, without discriminating based on their ethnic-ity, gender expression or identity, religion, sexual orientation, disability or any other aspect of diversity. We are deeply committed to diversity, which is one of the key drivers of the Group’s performance. That’s why, in 2018, the Group implemented the Inclusion Index, a tool aimed at promoting diversity and inclusion initiatives within companies. These included initiatives run under the EllesVMH program, which is aimed at boosting career development for women, who currently hold 64% of executive and man-ager positions and 44% of top management positions.Promoting our expertise In 2021, LVMH also stepped up its efforts to preserve its métiers d’excellence (professions of excellence), as the wealth of expertise they represent is vital to its Maisons’ long-term future and success. The Group boasts more than 280 professions of excellence in the fields of design, craftsmanship and the customer experience, making LVMH the company with the largest variety of these professions in the world, all of which are essential components of humanity’s intangible cultural heritage. These professions are carried out by more than 80,000 people within LVMH. In 2021, the entire LVMH Executive Committee and the Presidents of the Group’s Maisons signed the WE for ME (Worldwide Engagements for Métiers d’Excellence) agreement, aimed at recognizing this community of tal-ented craftspeople, whose work often takes place behind the scenes, far from the spotlight. To highlight their skills and attract new talent, LVMH has launched a range of initiatives to raise awareness of these noble professions among younger generations. Through its “Excellent!” ­program, the Group holds job discovery workshops for middle school students in France. LVMH’s Village des \fMétiers d’Excellence, an annual vocational training fair allowing students to learn about apprenticeships in these professions, offered more than 400 work-linked training positions with 39 Group Maisons and 21 partner schools and universities. LVMH’s Institut des Métiers d’Excellence (IME) confirmed its extraordinary growth trajectory, wel-coming its largest class of students since it was estab-lished, with 339 new apprentices in six countries (France, Switzerland, Italy, Spain, Japan and Germany). Since 2014, more than 1,400 apprentices have been trained in 27 pro-fessions by the IME.Supporting younger generations and people undergoing retraining alikeCrafting the future means lending support to younger generations as they face challenging economic conditions. LVMH has boosted its initiatives and programs aimed at this group, announcing in particular that it would be hiring 25,000 people under 30 around the world by the end of 2022. In parallel, the Group has continued to provide practical guidance to young people as they build their career plans. One prominent example of this commitment is INSIDE LVMH, which offers students from all over the world a platform aimed at expanding their knowledge of the luxury industry and providing additional training to help them prepare for their careers. It features 50 hours of original content presented by luxury industry experts, along with a 30-hour certification program with exclusive content. More than 43,000 young people have already registered on the platform, half of whom took part in the certification program. LVMH continues to have a very strong appeal among young people. For the 16th consecutive year, the Group topped the Universum ranking of preferred employers among business school students in France. The Group is also very highly rated – and on the rise – in international rankings.LVMH is also taking action to improve access to employ-ment for adults over the age of 25 through the LIVE ­(L’Institut des Vocations pour l’Emploi) training program. Launched in September 2019 by Brigitte Macron and LVMH, LIVE now has three locations: Clichy-sous-Bois, Valence (in the southeast of France) and Roubaix, on the Jean Arnault Campus, which was inaugurated in 2021. More than 200 people have already taken advantage of the support offered by this program to develop their career plans, and over 75% of them have successfully found a job, begun training or started a business following their experience at LIVE. The start of the 2021 academic year in September saw the arrival of 180 new learners at the three LIVE campuses for a six-month program.Building our future togetherThe success of our Maisons is built on our longstanding belief that our people make all the difference. Recent graduates, employees, managers and senior executives: they are all our greatest assets – our lifeblood.In a world in constant flux, where many jobs have drasti-cally transformed from how they were several years ago, with some new roles not even existing before, being able to identify, attract and retain top talent within LVMH is key. The Group’s new “Craft the Future” employer brand reflects this ambition, with thousands of in-house ambas-sadors trained and a new social media campaign unveiled this past December.As a rapidly growing group, we also see being able to share information in real time and strengthening LVMH’s corporate ­culture as key priorities. That’s why the LVMH Group has launched a new global intranet called Voices, aimed at all 175,000 of our employees around the world. It serves as a single platform for all the Group’s com-munication needs, and also allows information to be reported and fed back by its different Maisons, regions and professions.Together we will craft the future of LVMH: a future that is inextricably linked to the world in which we live and operate; a world that is more respectful of nature and of those who live in it. This is our roadmap for the year ahead and beyond.\fLVMH 2021  .  Ta l e n t32  •  33175,647employees worldwide37Average age71%women45,076joiners(1)EMPLOYEES BY REGION(as %)Other markets9%Asia(excl.

LIFE 360 IS AN ACTION PLAN THAT RALLIES  OUR MAISONS’ CREATIVITY AND INSPIRATION TO DESIGN PRODUCTS THAT  EMBODY EXCELLENCE IN THEIR DESIGN AND SUSTAINABILITY ALIKE: PRODUCTS WITH  A POWERFUL APPEAL YET A MINIMAL IMPACT ON NATURE AND THE CLIMATE.“2021 must be the year to reconcile humanity with nature,” declared António Guterres, Secretary-General of the UN, in January during the opening ceremony of the One Planet Summit for biodiversity. A few months later, at the Group’s Shareholders’ Meeting on April 15, 2021, LVMH presented LIFE 360, its new environmental strat-egy, which sets targets for 2023, 2026 and 2030, with the objective of forging a new alliance between luxury crafts-manship and nature. With four strategic action plans structured around biodiversity, circular design, traceability and climate, LIFE 360 is rolled out at each individual ­Maison and promotes continuous improvement in the Group’s environmental performance.Transforming our relationship with natureIn 2021, LVMH and Usbek & Rica launched a series of interviews on nature and living beings with prominent figures from the scientific community and civil society to answer questions such as, “Are humans (really) animals like any other?” These discussions helped raise awareness of the crucial role of nature, on which all the Group’s busi-nesses undeniably depend: there can be no champagne without grapes, no perfume without plants, no evening gowns without silkworm farms. To reduce its impact on nature, LVMH has chosen to have its plant and animal supply chains certified to the highest standards for protect-ing biodiversity and animal welfare, and has prohibited the sourcing of raw materials in areas with a high risk of deforestation and desertification. LVMH is also taking action to restore biodiversity, with the ambitious target of restoring 5 million hectares of flora and fauna habitat by 2030. To give back what it borrows from nature, the Group has implemented regenerative farming practices with the assistance of a network of experts including ­Biosphères, reNature, Earthworm, Pour une Agriculture du Vivant and Savory Institute, for grapes, cotton, wool, leather, palm, beets and the iconic ingredients used by the Perfumes and Cosmetics Maisons. The Group’s partner-ship with UNESCO as part of its Man and the Biosphere ­program has enabled it to support the sustainable use of biodiversity with local populations in Bolivia, Ecuador, Brazil and Peru. Meanwhile, Moët Hennessy has launched reforestation programs in Kenya, China, the United States and South Africa with its partner Reforest’Action, while LVMH Italia has partnered with the ForestaMi project, which aims to plant 3 million trees in the Milan metropol-itan area by 2030. This extensive LIFE 360 Biodiversity program was presented by Antoine Arnault, the Group’s head of Image and Environment, at the CEO Summit that opened the IUCN World Conservation Congress held in Marseille in September 2021.Enhancing the appeal of the circular economyLIFE 360 aims to make preserving natural resources a central focus of product design. This is the goal of the Circular Design action plan, under which the Group aims to apply a sustainable design approach to all of its prod-ucts by 2030. In 2021, Louis Vuitton expanded its range of sustainably designed products, now branded with the LV upcycling logo (combining Louis Vuitton’s initials with the upcycling symbol), while Loewe offered a bag made entirely of leather offcuts. LVMH’s 75 Maisons offer a vast range of opportunities to explore potential new Group-wide circular design practices. For example, at Berluti, leather offcuts are reclaimed by artist Jorge Penadés and incorporated into furniture for Belmond hotels and stores. In 2021, Nona Source – a resale platform for the Maisons’ unused fabrics – resonated with a wide audience of in-house and outside buyers as soon as it was launched. Product durability – a core component of LVMH’s busi-ness model – was extended by offering new services inspired by the Watches & Jewelry business group, which, \fin addition to repairing products, offers them a second life by bestowing them with a new appearance. More than ever in 2021, innovation played a key role in optimizing the Group’s environmental impact: LVMH and Central Saint Martins signed a new partnership to create a research platform focused on regenerative luxury; Fendi, in part-nership with CSM and Imperial College London, explored the possibility of transforming lab-made keratin into fibers, then bio-based fur. Packaging followed a similar sustain-able design trajectory, with the aim of eliminating the use of plastic derived from fossil fuels by 2026. The use of Eastman molecular plastics recycling technologies is one way of achieving this goal, as Parfums Christian Dior did for the packaging of Dior Addict Lip Maximizer, released in summer 2021.Collaborating for excellence in traceabilityThe aim of LIFE 360 is to ensure full traceability across all the Group’s strategic supply chains, for each step from field to final product, with the goal of covering all sourcing channels with a dedicated traceability system by 2030. To achieve this goal, LVMH has developed new solutions tailored to each sourcing channel’s specific features, and together with Prada Group and Cartier (a subsidiary of Richemont) announced the launch of the Aura Block-chain Consortium: a unique, global blockchain solution, open to all luxury brands worldwide to address shared challenges in responsible sourcing. LVMH has also chosen to participate in certification systems that ensure that ethical, environmental and social standards are met at each step of a material’s processing, including GOTS (Global Organic Textile Standard) and RWS (Responsible Wool Standard) for cotton and merino wool, and RJC CoC (Responsible Jewellery Council Chain-of-Custody) certification for precious metals such as gold. Rigorous traceability is also key to being able to collect reliable data, accurately measure a product’s environmental ­performance and share this information with customers, especially as the Group has set a target of ensuring each product is covered by an information system by 2030. Putting this idea into practice by making all its supplier data available online, Fendi achieved a very significant increase in its ranking in the Fashion Transparency Index in 2021. LVMH is also actively involved in initiatives currently underway in France and Europe aimed at introducing labeling that shows the environmental performance of fashion products, and has joined forces with cosmetics stakeholders to develop a rating system for the environ-mental impact of beauty products.Taking action for the climateAt the end of 2021, LVMH’s new carbon trajectory was validated by SBTi (the Science Based Targets initiative). It is based on the following targets: reducing greenhouse gas emissions from energy consumption at its sites and stores by 50% by 2026 (baseline: 2019); and reducing Scope 3 emissions (raw materials, purchases, transport, waste, product use and end of life) by 55% per unit of added value by 2030 (baseline: 2019). The Group has identified a number of key vectors to achieving these targets, which are covered by specific action plans rolled out at all of its Maisons, including having all sites and stores use only renewable or low-carbon energy by 2026, shifting toward shipping more freight by sea and by road, and launching a green e-commerce program and a mate-rials innovation policy focused on Scope 3 emissions. In 2021, the climate roadmaps for the Group’s Maisons were reflected in new policies on logistics, supply chains and packaging. Starting in 2023, Hennessy will transport four million bottles between France and the United States via sailing cargo ships through a partnership with Neoline, a maritime transport company; the Fashion and Leather Goods Maisons (Berluti, Christian Dior Couture, Fendi, Kenzo and Louis Vuitton) are focusing on certified or recycled materials with a reduced carbon impact, while Guerlain, Parfums Christian Dior and Givenchy offer refill-able or significantly lighter packaging: for example, refills for Christian Dior’s fragrance Sauvage use less glass, reducing the related greenhouse gas emissions by 56%. In fall 2021, LVMH and SAVE Energies (France’s second-­largest buyer of biomethane) entered into a three-year partnership to replace the Group’s fossil fuel consump-tion in France with green gas, allowing 14,000 metric tons of CO₂ equivalent emissions to be avoided each year starting in 2023. At COP26, LVMH had the opportunity to present and share news of these achievements, along with the roll-out of regenerative farming practices, which, by improving soil quality, also help maximize its carbon capture potential.\fLVMH 2021  .

All the vineyards owned by LVMH have had sustainable winegrowing certification since 2017, and the Maisons forge partnerships with winegrowers by helping their independent grape suppliers comply with these certifications. Significant work is also being done in the area of packaging. The Maisons are devoting equal effort to actively developing their production capacities, as seen in the responsible, innovative and efficient Pont Neuf bottling and logistics facility inaugurated by Hennessy in 2017, which reflects the Maison’s long-term vision.2022 OutlookWhile ensuring that it remains alert and responsive amid the prevailing volatility and tight supply environment, the Wines & Spirits business group remains resolutely ­optimistic about the medium-term development prospects of its Maisons. Moët Hennessy will continue to strengthen its portfolio and accelerate the transformation and selectiv-ity of its distribution, while remaining close to consumers by offering them an ever-expanding and innovative range of experiences. Excellence, authenticity and sustainability remain key, backed by the launch of bold and inspiring innovations and collaborations.

They reaffirmed their social and environmental commitment through the “Living Soils – Living Together” program. This was underscored by the opening of the Robert-Jean de Vogüé research center in France’s Champagne region, which will support the Maisons in their transition  to more sustainable practices and their adaptation  to climate change. Champagne volumes were up 27% with respect to 2020 and 3% compared with 2019, with particularly strong growth in Europe and the United States. Moët & Chandon achieved good growth in all regions, particularly in the United States and in Europe, where it beat its record sales volumes of 2018 worldwide.  At the end of the year, the “Effervescence” program brought together friends of the Maison, which  has been an icon of celebration and history’s most memorable events since 1743.

For Louis Vuitton, the end of the year was saddened  by the loss of Virgil Abloh, who had served as Creative Director of Menswear since March 2018. Using his vision and his unique talent to challenge established practice in fashion, he was among those who most brilliantly expressed the creative freedom and timeless modernity of Louis Vuitton. The Maison paid a deeply emotional tribute to him at the runway show in Miami “Virgil Was Here”, on November 30. Illustrating its creative energy and its pursuit of excellence in craftsmanship, the Maison continued  its dialogue with the world of art, reinvented its iconic models and unveiled a number of initiatives in connection with the bicentenary of its founder’s birth. The LV Pont 9 handbag collection welcomed a soft, rounded new version, while the Petite Malle, a symbol of the Maison’s rich heritage, took the spotlight in an array of new formats. By reinterpreting the Maison’s signatures,  the new Bravery high jewelry collection also paid tribute to its founder.

Its range of fragrances was expanded  with the Extraits collection, composed of five scents whose bottle was designed by Frank Gehry, and the Spell On You fragrance showcased in a video starring Léa Seydoux. At its stores and through its original,  high-quality digital initiatives, the Maison continued  to offer its customers a unique experience. The store network was expanded with the inauguration  of an emblematic store in Tokyo and the opening  at La Samaritaine Pont-Neuf in Paris. Committed to making its products ever more sustainable, particularly by focusing on repairability from the very beginning  of the design process, the Maison also stepped up its efforts to reduce their environmental impact throughout their entire life cycle. The LV Pillow leather goods collection and the sustainable Felt Line in Menswear were  two illustrations of this approach in 2021.

The Maison draws on the virtues of the exceptional Château d’Yquem terroir – which is owned by the LVMH Group – in the formulation of its  L’Or de Vie cream, which was created in 2007. In 2021, this mythical cream was rejuvenated with a new Yquem sap-enriched formula, itself the fruit of nine years of research. As well as its famed grand crus wines, the Bordeaux vineyard is renowned for the Yquem sap, the lifeblood that irrigates  the core of the vine. L’Or de Vie’s new formulation captures all the longevity secrets of Yquem sap, and offers the most powerful antioxidant protection in the Dior range.\f104  •  105LVMH 2021  .

It continues to gain market share with a successful strategy that is driven by jewelry Maisons that carry on exceptional creative ­legacies and expertise, and by leading watchmaking Maisons that are always on the cutting edge of innovation. 2021 saw the arrival of the prestigious American jewelry house Tiffany & Co., which has substantially bolstered the business group’s standing in a very dynamic, highly promising market segment.Creativity, brand awareness  and in-depth expertiseThe growth of these Maisons is driven by their creativity. They enrich leading product ranges with well-established designs and identities, such as Bulgari’s iconic Serpenti range and TAG Heuer and Hublot’s famous Carrera and Big Bang collections. They continually explore new horizons with innovations combining audacity with excel-lence, as illustrated by TAG Heuer’s next-generation smartwatch. Harnessing expertise is a key priority, which the Maisons address by optimizing their manufacturing processes, implementing synergies and boosting their production capacity.

In an equally selective approach, the Maisons also con-tinue to refurbish and open their own directly operated stores in buoyant markets in key cities.2022 Outlook With the arrival of Tiffany & Co., the Watches and Jewelry business group is now a leading global player. It will con-tinue to drive its development by focusing on creativity, excellent craftsmanship and corporate social responsibil-ity.

Including Tiffany & Co., growth was much stronger, showing the transformative contribution of this iconic brand. The Maisons were buoyed by the gradual recovery in their local markets, primarily China and the United States, and the use  of distribution methods well-suited to the public health context: direct sales and digital channels. New watch designs were unveiled in the first half of the year at trade fairs that were held in innovative new formats.Tiffany & Co. achieved a record performance in terms  of revenue, profit and cash flow. The Maison raised its global profile through its innovations and high-profile collaborations. For the first time in its history,  Tiffany & Co.’s annual Blue Book collection of high jewelry was unveiled in China. A series of events followed in New York, Los Angeles and Dubai, giving customers the opportunity to discover the extraordinary necklace, featuring over 180 carats of diamonds, inspired by  the pendant unveiled at the 1939 New York World’s Fair. Following these presentations, high jewelry sales reached an unprecedented level. Rosé, the young singer of South Korean band Blackpink, became the new face of the HardWear collection. This very well-received revival led to a doubling of sales for this core line, which embodies bold femininity. The Knot collection – a limited edition designed in collaboration with artist Daniel Arsham – was another major success, as was the Tiffany x Supreme collaboration. December saw the launch of the highly anticipated limited edition of the watch designed by Patek Philippe and Tiffany & Co. to celebrate 170 years of collaboration between Patek and Tiffany & Co. in the US, with the auction of the first watch of 170 limited editions raising a record level of funds for The Nature Conservancy. Honoring  its long tradition of expressions of love and diversity, the Maison launched its “About Love” global campaign starring Beyoncé and Jay-Z. Among the jewelry featured was the legendary Tiffany Diamond, making Beyoncé only the fourth person to wear it since  its discovery in 1877. This campaign – one of the year’s most prominent – was a powerful affirmation of the brand’s resolutely modern tone, boosting its appeal and expressing its core values. Three openings –  \fat Le Bon Marché in Paris, in Barcelona and in Stockholm – marked a new aesthetic for Tiffany & Co.’s stores.Bulgari regained solid momentum, driven by the strong performance of its jewelry and watch lines at its directly operated stores. In jewelry, the recent B.zero1 Rock and Serpenti Viper collections were the main growth drivers. The Maison rolled out its Magnifica high jewelry collection presented in June, while at  the end of the year, the launch of the Jannah collection proved extremely promising. In watches, growth  was driven by Serpenti Seduttori, Octo Finissimo (which won the Aiguille d’Or grand prize at the Geneva Watchmaking Grand Prix) and Bulgari Aluminium.  The Maison’s performance was all the more remarkable given the limited recovery in international travel  and its increasingly selective presence at multi-brand stores. Jewelry in particular is now exclusively distributed through its directly operated stores.  The Bulgari hotel collection expanded with the addition of a seventh showpiece, the Bulgari Hotel Paris, which opened in December on Avenue George V.TAG Heuer marked the start of a major partnership with Porsche with the launch of the TAG Heuer Carrera Porsche chronograph. The latest edition of the TAG Heuer Carrera 3 Aiguilles featured Ryan Gosling as its brand ambassador, while the Aquaracer line was completely revisited.

Achieving this requires the cooperation of every ­stakeholder in the value chain, from mines to jewelry workshops. All of the Maison’s rough diamonds are traceable back to the mine. They are mainly sourced from five countries: Botswana, Canada, Namibia, Russia and South Africa. All of the gold, silver and platinum used to manufacture products is also traceable to the mine or the recycler. In 2021, the Maison purchased its first Fairmined-certified gold from mines in Peru.

In the United States, the implementation of its partnership with Kohl’s will help amplify its success with an expanded presence and a closer connection to American customers. The Maison will continue investing to sustain its strong momentum in other strategic markets such as the Middle East and Canada, as well as to expand its retail network in major cities and scale up its digital strategy. In 2022, DFS’ priority will be placed on tourism at its key destinations: Hainan, Macao and potentially Hong Kong in the second half of the fiscal year. Partial air traffic recovery forecasts – which are more favorable, with the exception of China – will be closely monitored to ensure that reopenings are in line with local authorities’ requirements and the return of travelers.

Building on its expanded geographic presence and  its pursuit of excellence in its omnichannel strategy, Sephora was highly resilient and delivered another strong performance thanks to the upturn in activity  at its stores and the continued momentum of its online sales. Despite the pandemic-related closures for part of the year, the expansion of its store network continued, especially in China and the United States, particularly following the large-scale partnership with US distributor Kohl’s. The Maison continued to develop its digital offering with a series of new initiatives, including  a long-term strategic partnership with the Zalando platform for the creation of a “prestige beauty” selection, launched in Germany in the second half  of the year; the acquisition of Feelunique, one of the leading players in the online selective beauty segment in the United Kingdom; a series of new transnational e-commerce initiatives to serve various countries in Asia; ramping up its own websites, resulting in record online sales; and developing innovative services to ensure  a smooth omnichannel purchasing experience  for customers, such as same-day delivery, which  has been successfully rolled out in the United States. This strategy helped dynamize its key brands  and categories, particularly skincare, fragrances  and haircare, while makeup showed encouraging signs of recovery.

The Maison also launched highly innovative campaigns to celebrate black beauty in North America and expanded its selection of brands founded by people of color, in line with the commitment undertaken in 2020. Thanks to its relentless drive for innovation and highly motivated staff, Sephora returned to its pre-pandemic sales levels and was listed in the prestigious Interbrand  Best Global Brands 2021 ranking. The public health crisis continued to impact DFS’ business due to the very limited recovery in international travel, travel restrictions in China and quarantine measures implemented in Hong Kong.

Attendees were free to explore and try out the iconic products and just-launched new labels available at Sephora through exclusive content and virtual encounters with brand founders. The experience was based on a 3D, 360° game-like environment with an interactive beauty “house” featuring several themed rooms  that attendees could explore while playing games and joining in activities. The event was free of charge and open to all participants who registered to attend. Attendees could also opt in to purchase Experience Kits – complete with a host of products and surprises – which were dispatched to them by mail. Having made digital and omnichannel a strategic priority, the Maison is now focusing on bringing its highly popular, unique in-store experiences online.      \t   S E P H O R A “Meeting” beauty          icons in a virtual    house of beauty\f138  •  139LVMH 2021  .

This installation was inspired by  the Amazons, who according to myth cut off their right breasts to become better archers. The artist played with symbols typically associated with these women warriors and created an installation built around three powerful visual elements: a breast-shaped target, a bow and arrows.\fBelmond, Hotel Cipriani, Venice\fLVMHCulture & Lifestyle2021\f2 0 2 1S T O R I E S     LV M H  H O T E L  M A N A G E M E N T    Cheval Blanc:  A new contemporary haven             in the heart of ParisCheval Blanc has unveiled its first urban home away from home, ideally located in the heart of Paris between the Marais, the Île de la Cité and the Louvre. The hotel – which only has 72 rooms – was purposely designed by architects Peter Marino and Édouard François to offer guests an experience rather than  a setting, with every detail chosen  to recreate the intimacy of a private home. Vast bay windows offer stunning views of Paris in every room and each of the four restaurants. Guests can unwind  in the peaceful surroundings  of the wellness space and Dior Spa Cheval Blanc. Finally, encapsulating the quest for excellence at  Cheval Blanc Paris, are Plénitude – its gourmet restaurant run by  chef Arnaud Donckele – and the Apartment – its truly exceptional space on the top floor.\f144  •  145LVMH 2021  .

Introduction  This report explores various investment incentives and the tax treatment of investments in the following jurisdictions: Australia, Brazil, Canada, China, Germany, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, Turkey, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Jurisdictions have been chosen based on the size of their economies, and the report addresses the primary incentives for making equity investments to corporations, from both a corporate and individual investor perspective.   Individual report components contain sections explaining the income tax and capital gains tax for each jurisdiction. There are also sections explaining special provisions for real estate and value added tax (VAT). Other incentives are also identified when available, which include industry specific investments and employee-employer related incentives. Finally, the reports end with an overview of any foreign investment incentives and the identification of tax treaties and international agreements.   II.  Tax Rates  Most of the jurisdictions surveyed subject individuals to a progressive tax rate based on income. Corporate tax rates are generally flat, but conditions apply in some jurisdictions. Progressive individual tax rates range from 0% of income and approach 50% of income in some jurisdictions. The applicable laws in the United Kingdom, Israel, and Portugal all contain provisions for tax rates up to 47%-48%. Other jurisdictions levy further individual income taxes in certain situations. In Iran, when there is a major year-over-year change in income for a person, there is a one-time additional percentage tax of up to 5%. In Germany, there is an additional 25% tax on investment income.

Corporate tax rates in the surveyed jurisdictions are generally flat or fixed, ranging from 9.9% in South Korea, to 38% in Canada. The majority of the surveyed jurisdictions fall somewhere in the 20%-30% rate. Some jurisdictions have special conditions for corporate tax rates. In Kenya, the tax rate is 30% for resident companies and 37.5% for nonresident companies. Likewise, in Portugal, the tax rate is 21% for resident companies and 25% for nonresident companies. In Australia, certain companies are subject to a 25% tax rate while others are subject to a 35% tax rate. In Turkey, the corporate tax rate was reduced from 23% in 2022 to 20% in 2023.

III.  Capital Gains  Capital gains are a special tax attributed to the realization of profits when trading securities and, sometimes, real estate. The majority of the jurisdictions surveyed have a capital gains tax regime, and the jurisdictions that do not have a capital gains tax typically still have special rules for taxing investment income.  A.  Jurisdictions with Capital Gains Tax Regimes  Of the surveyed jurisdictions, Australia, Brazil, Canada, Egypt, France, Greece, Israel, India, Iran, Japan, Kenya, South Korea, Portugal, Russia, Sweden, the United States, Turkey, and the United Kingdom have a capital gains tax regime. The rates range from 0% to 30%, with many special conditions, other exemptions, and incentives available. Many jurisdictions levy taxes based on the length of time an asset is held, generally referred to as a short-term or long-term gain. Long-term gains are frequently given a preferential tax treatment, while in some jurisdictions a short-term gain is taxed at the regular marginal individual income tax rate. In Canada, India, Russia, the United States, and Turkey, there are differences for long-term and short-term gains.   Some jurisdictions have special rules based on the nature of the company or the nature of the investor. In Australia, there is a discount for equity investments. In Canada, qualified small-businesses have a capital gains deduction. In Egypt, a tax of 5% applies to companies listed on the Egyptian Stock Exchange, and 10% is levied on dividends from stocks in unlisted (over the counter, or OTC) companies. Similarly, in Iran, a 10% rebate on capital gains for listed companies (both foreign and domestic) is available, while there is a 5% deduction for OTC companies. In Portugal, there is a 28% tax for resident business issued stock, and 35% for non-resident business issued stock. Relatedly, in Kenya, the tax rates are different based on whether the investor is a resident (including residents of an East African Community Partner State) or non-resident.   3 Lower rate for resident vs. non-resident companies. 4 Lower rate for companies with profits below £50,000 (approx. US$63,908). \fInvestment Incentives: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 4 B.  Jurisdictions without Capital Gains Tax Regimes  Jurisdictions surveyed without an explicit capital gains tax are China, Mexico, Portugal, and Taiwan. However, in some of these jurisdictions, there are investment vehicles that receive preferential treatment. In Portugal, there is a limited capital gains tax for corporate entities. In Australia, there are special tax discounts on long-term assets available to individuals and small businesses. In Mexico, all income is subject to ordinary income tax but some securities are subject to a 10% tax.   C.  Real Estate Gains  Some jurisdictions have special tax rates or incentives for real estate transactions. Real estate incentives are identified in Brazil, Iran, Kenya, South Korea, Portugal, Sweden, the United States, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and France. In Sweden, there are provisions to delay taxation on real estate transfers. Similarly, in the United States, there are provisions for like-kind exchanges of real estate. In Turkey, a real estate transaction is a taxable event unless the property has been held for over five years. In Iran, there is a 25% deduction in tax on both rental income and property transfers. Similarly, in France, there is an exemption on rental income less than € 15,000 (approx. US$16,433) and for certain sales of property.   IV.  Other Incentives  A wide spectrum of other incentives is identified in the surveyed jurisdictions, including tax abatements or tax holidays, reduced rates or complete exemptions for investment in targeted industries or in targeted initiatives, and other incentives for different classes of businesses and investors. Some of the more unique incentives identified include a reduced rate of taxation on investments of persons aged 60 years or older in Israel; a tax exemption for increasing the workforce in Iran; an exemption from import duties on foreign companies when the final product will be exported in Mexico; and a full exemption available when re-investing within a company in the United Kingdom. In Egypt, Iran, and Russia, there are also incentives related to the value added tax (VAT) identified.  A.  Special Industries  Many jurisdictions incentivize investment in certain industries or classifications of company. Frequently, investments in the agricultural, technological, and environmental spheres receive preferential treatment. In China, Taiwan, Portugal, Iran, Greece, Israel, and Germany, there are incentives for different sectors. In Australia, there are investment incentives available for newer companies. In Russia, there are exemptions for corporate property and for investment in certain companies related to the government. In Taiwan and France, there are incentives for investment in small companies. In Sweden, there is an incentive for investment in new companies, and similarly in Turkey, there is an incentive for investing in a company that just issued its stock publicly (IPO).   \fInvestment Incentives: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 5 B.  Employee Share Plans  Many of the surveyed jurisdictions provide incentives for investments made through an employee share plan, whether that be through stock options or retirement funds. Jurisdictions surveyed that have identified incentives in this area are Australia, Brazil, Germany, India, Iran, Portugal, the United States, the United Kingdom, France, and Canada. In India and the United States, deferral of capital gains tax is the primary incentive. In France and the United Kingdom, there are tax incentives for both employees and employers. In Germany, there are incentives available for employees only.  V.  Foreign Investments and Tax Treaties  International cooperation with treaties on tax evasion and double taxation on income are a common theme among the surveyed nations. In some instances, incentives and provisions related to foreign investment, both foreign direct investment (FDI) and domestic offshore investment, are identified. Several of the surveyed jurisdictions also have special incentives and tax rules related to free trade zones (FTZs).  A.  Foreign Direct Investment  There are differing conditions related to foreign direct investment and offshore investment identified in several of the jurisdictions surveyed. In Israel, Iran, Russia, Taiwan, China, Turkey, Brazil, Canada, and Egypt, there are provisions identified discussing this kind of investment, including incentives in certain circumstances. In jurisdictions such as Israel, there are no restrictions on foreign investment unless it is deemed a national security interest. In Russia, there is a list of unfriendly jurisdictions. In Taiwan and Brazil, there are no rules per se, but transactions must be registered with the central authority or bank. In China, there are strict controls on outbound investing.  B.  Tax Treaties  The primary tax treaties identified in the surveys deal with double taxation and tax evasion. Mutual investment treaties are also identified in several jurisdictions.  C.  Free Trade Zones  FTZs are special economic zones that feature different tax and trade regulations from the rest of the jurisdiction. They go by different names depending on the jurisdiction. In this survey, Brazil, Egypt, Israel, Iran, Kenya, South Korea, Mexico, Portugal, Russia, Taiwan, France, and China had at least one FTZ identified. In jurisdictions like Iran and Mexico, there are exemptions for 0% VAT. Some jurisdictions, like Portugal (Madeira) and Israel (Eilat, on the Red Sea), have one specific FTZ. Other jurisdictions, like Russia and Brazil, have many identified FTZs. Each of the FTZs identified in the surveys contains somewhat unique provisions, further explained in the individual report components. \fInvestment Incentives: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 6  Maximum Individual Tax Rates by Jurisdiction   \fInvestment Incentives: Comparative Summary  The Law Library of Congress 7 Maximum Corporate Tax Rates by Jurisdiction  \fThe Law Library of Congress 8 Australia Kelly Buchanan Chief, Foreign, Comparative, and International Law Division II    SUMMARY Under the Australian tax system, net capital gains are taxed as ordinary income; no separate rate applies. For individuals, a capital gains tax (CGT) discount of 50% applies to assets held for at least 12 months prior to the relevant CGT event. The discount is not available to companies or non-resident taxpayers. Additional investment incentives for individuals include a carry-forward tax offset and modified CGT treatment for qualifying investments in an “early stage innovation company” (also available to corporate investors); special tax treatment for employee share programs; and incentives for investments made through superannuation programs. For businesses, four CGT concessions are available to small businesses, provided various conditions are met. In addition, the Venture Capital Limited Partnership and Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnership programs “are designed to increase venture capital investment in Australia by providing beneficial tax treatment to eligible local and foreign investors.” Other incentives, including grants and special tax treatment, may be available from the federal or state governments depending on the project or sector involved.   I.  Introduction  Generally, Australian residents for tax purposes1 are taxed on their worldwide income.2 The country does not have a separate capital gains tax (CGT) rate.3 Instead, net capital gains are assessed as ordinary income,4 with capital gains and losses to be reported on annual income tax returns following a “CGT event.”5 The tax rate that applies is therefore an individual’s marginal income tax rate, or a company’s tax rate.  In terms of shares, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) explains that a CGT event occurs when there is a capital payment for shares.6 The timing of the event is when the company pays a non- 1 “Resident” or “resident of Australia” is defined in Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (ITAA 1936) s 6(1), https://perma.cc/9FNH-VTKS (vol. 1). 2 Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (ITAA 1997) ss 6-5 & 6-10, https://perma.cc/X47H-W4L8 (vol. 1). Exceptions include foreign income of companies from foreign branches with a permanent establishment in the other country (ITAA 1936 s 23AH), and income of foreign subsidiaries of Australian resident companies or where a company has a less than 10% holding in a foreign company (ITAA 1997 s 768-5).  3 See What is Capital Gains Tax?, Australian Taxation Office (ATO), https://perma.cc/TF3U-QGAV.  4 See ITAA 1997 s 102-5 (“Assessable income includes net capital gain”), https://perma.cc/J6TN-YMG2 (vol. 3). 5 What is Capital Gains Tax?, supra note 3. 6 CGT Events, ATO, https://perma.cc/NFC2-BFUP.  \fInvestment Incentives: Australia The Law Library of Congress 9 assessable amount, with the capital gain being the payment less the cost base of the shares.7 The ATO notes that selling shares or units is the most common CGT event with respect to such assets.8  Rules related to taxation, including CGT and tax incentives for investments, are contained in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth) (ITAA 1997) and the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth) (ITAA 1936).  II.  Tax Rates  The current individual income tax rates for residents are as follows9:  Taxable income (AUD) Marginal rate (%) 0 – 18,200  0 18,201 – 45,000 19 45,001 – 120,000 32.5 120,001 – 180,000 37 Over 180,000 45  The company tax rate is 25% for “base rate entities.”10 For all other companies the rate is 30%.11  III.  Individual Incentives  A.  CGT Discount  Australia provides a capital gains tax (CGT) discount of 50% that is available where an Australian resident taxpayer has owned an asset for 12 months or more before the CGT event occurs.12  The discount is not available to companies, but is available to partnerships and trusts, in addition to individuals.13 It is also not available to foreign residents for assets acquired after May 8, 2012.14   7 Id; ITAA 1997 s 104-5, CGT Event G1 (vol. 3).  8 When CGT Applies to Shares and Units, ATO, https://perma.cc/U9MC-7BU3.  9 See Individual Income Tax Rates – Residents, 2023–24, ATO, https://perma.cc/23JY-YTHP.  10 Tax Rates 2022–23 – Companies, ATO, https://perma.cc/TMJ3-CUJY.   11 Id.

It provides: To be a discount capital gain, the capital gain must be made by (a) an individual or (b) a complying superannuation entity or (c) a trust or (d) a life insurance company in relation to . . . a complying superannuation asset.

However, technical rules apply to claiming a tax credit for tax paid on the gains resulting from a CGT event in another country.  In 2019, the Full Federal Court of Australia held that where an Australian tax resident owns a capital asset in the US, and is eligible for the Australian CGT discount, they may not be able to claim all of the US tax paid as a credit under Australia’s foreign income tax offset (FITO) rules and the Australia-US double tax treaty.15 A commentator explains the technical reasons as follows:  In essence a FITO under section 770-10 of the ITAA 1997 is strictly confined to foreign income that is subject to foreign tax. Under the Discount regime in Division 115 and under section 102-5 of the ITAA 1997 only the net capital gain after applying the Discount, which is 50% in the case of a resident individual, is included in assessable income. It follows that a component of a capital gain taxed as a foreign capital gain is not taxed in Australia where the capital gain is a discount capital gain under Division 115. That is a Discount capital gain to an Australian resident individual taxable on their worldwide income that arises from a capital gain made in the US is made up of:  • 50% that is taxed in the US which is included in Australia assessable income as net capital gain; and • 50% that is taxed in the US but which is not included in assessable income in Australia viz. it is exempt from tax in Australia.  The Full Federal Court confirmed that a FITO is only available in relation to the first of these 50% categories.16  Essentially, “Australian taxpayers, to whom the 50% capital gains tax (CGT) discount applies are only entitled to a foreign income tax offset (FITO) in respect of half of the US tax paid in respect of [the] gain.”17  B.  Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investors  Tax incentives are available for early-stage investors as follows:  From 1 July 2016, if you invest in a qualifying early stage innovation company (ESIC), you may be eligible for the tax incentives for early stage investors (sometimes referred to as ‘angel investors’) contained in Division 360 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997.   15 Burton v Commissioner of Taxation [2019] FCAFC 141, https://perma.cc/JB8Q-TCDQ.

The FITO rules are contained in ITAA1997 div 770, https://perma.cc/83CM-A263 (vol. 9). 16 Foreign Income Tax Offsets and Discount Capital Gains – The Burton Effect, The Tax Objection (May 31, 2022), https://perma.cc/4PNU-Z4MF.  17 New Developments in Investment Management, from Burton, to Tax Standards, The Tax Institute (Feb. 28, 2023), https://perma.cc/XL9K-A35N.  \fInvestment Incentives: Australia The Law Library of Congress 11 The tax incentives provide eligible investors who purchase new shares in an ESIC with a:   non-refundable carry forward tax offset equal to 20% of the amount paid for their eligible investments. This is capped at a maximum tax offset amount of $200,000 for the investor and their affiliates combined in each income year  modified capital gains tax (CGT) treatment, under which capital gains on qualifying shares that are continuously held for at least 12 months and less than 10 years may be disregarded. Capital losses on shares held less than 10 years must be disregarded.  The maximum tax offset cap of $200,000 doesn’t limit the shares that qualify for the modified CGT treatment.  Investors who don’t meet the ‘sophisticated investor’ test under the Corporations Act 2001 won’t be eligible for any tax incentives if their total investment in qualifying ESICs in an income year is more than $50,000.18  C.  Special Tax Treatment for Employee Share Schemes  The ATO states that, in most cases, employees who obtain benefits through an employee share scheme (ESS) “will be eligible for special tax treatment (known as tax concessions).”19 In order for the concessions to apply, the employee and employer must have followed special tax rules, including that the ESS interests are provided at a discounted price. If the ESS tax rules do not apply, the CGT rules still apply.20  For an employee, the difference between the market value of the ESS interests and the amount the person paid to acquire those interests forms part of their assessable income and needs to be included in their tax return.21 The IBFD tax research platform explains that  [c]oncessional taxation is available in certain cases, in the form of an annual exemption of AUD 1,000, or in some circumstances in the form of a deferral of taxation for up to 15 years. The availability of the concessional treatment depends on the type of ESS and other factors, such as income of the employee. Under new rules effective from 1 July 2015, employees of start-up companies may be eligible for a tax-free treatment of the discount.22  D.  Superannuation  There are several tax incentives for investments made through superannuation (i.e., retirement savings) programs, including   18 Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investors, ATO, https://perma.cc/N3M8-Q4Y6.

Business/Corporate Incentives  A.  Small Business CGT Concessions  Division 152 of the ITAA 1997 contains four CGT concessions that allow small businesses “to reduce, disregard or defer some or all of a capital gain from an active asset used in a small business.”24 The small business CGT concessions include  • small business 15-year exemption, • small business 50% active asset reduction, • small business retirement exemption, and • small business roll-over.25  Assets must meet the “active asset test,”26 among other conditions. Generally, shares in companies are not considered active assets, unless they meet the “80% test,” and shares in widely held entities are also not considered active assets “unless held by a CGT concession stakeholder in the widely held entity.”27 Furthermore, there are “[e]xtra eligibility conditions for the small business CGT concessions if the asset is a share or interest in a trust.”28  The ATO explains that   [i]f you have more than one capital gain for the year, you can apply as many of the small business CGT concessions as you are eligible for until each capital gain is reduced to zero. Each active asset’s attributable capital gain is assessed for CGT concession eligibility individually.  The small business 50% active asset reduction applies automatically if the basic conditions are met and you have not specifically chosen for it not to apply.   23 Investing and Tax, Moneysmart.gov.au, https://perma.cc/S9CH-UPR7.

You need to choose by the day you lodge your income tax return for the income year in which the relevant CGT event happened unless we allow you to make the choice later.  Lodging and preparing your income tax return is generally enough proof of the choice you’ve made. However, for the small business retirement exemption, you must keep a written record of the amount you choose to disregard.29  B.  Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investors  The non-refundable carry forward tax offset and modified CGT treatment for investors in ESICs, outlined above, are available to corporate investors.30   C.  Venture Capital and Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnerships  The Venture Capital Limited Partnership (VCLP) and Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnership (ESVCLP) programs “are designed to increase venture capital investment in Australia by providing beneficial tax treatment to eligible local and foreign investors.”31 The ATO jointly administers the programs with AusIndustry.  The ATO explains the benefits of the programs as follows:  VCLP tax incentives and concessions include:   flow-through tax treatment for a VCLP  an exemption for eligible foreign venture capital limited partners from income tax on capital and revenue profits from the disposal of eligible venture capital investments by the VCLP  that fund managers are taxed on their carried interest in the partnership on capital account, rather than as income.  ESVCLP tax incentives and concessions include:   flow-through tax treatment for ESVCLP  an exemption for Australian and foreign venture capital partners from income tax on capital and revenue profits from the disposal of eligible venture capital investments made by the ESVCLP and any other income earned on these investments  that fund managers are taxed on their carried interest in the partnership on capital account, rather than as income.  From 1 July 2016, if you invest or have already invested in an ESVCLP you may be eligible for further tax incentives, including a non-refundable carried forward tax offset of up to  29 CGT Concessions Eligibility Overview, supra note 24. 30 See Australia: Corporate – Tax Credits and Incentives, PWC (last reviewed June 29, 2023), https://perma.cc/ENW4-PU66; Tax Incentives for Early Stage Investors, The Treasury, supra note 18. 31 Venture Capital and Early Stage Venture Capital Limited Partnerships, ATO, https://perma.cc/5QC3-FBZU.  \fInvestment Incentives: Australia The Law Library of Congress 14 10% of your contributions made to an ESVCLP that became unconditionally registered on or after 7 December 2015.32  In terms of foreign limited partners,  [g]ains and losses made on the disposal by the VCLP of eligible venture capital investments are not assessable or deductible and are disregarded for capital gains tax purposes if all the following apply:   The VCLP had owned the investment for at least 12 months.  You are a limited partner in the VCLP and you are a foreign resident.  You are either exempt from tax in your country of residence or if you are not exempt you have provided less than 10% of the VCLP’s committed capital.33  With respect to general partners,  [t]he carried interest of a general partner is the partner’s entitlement to a distribution from the VCLP, normally contingent on profits attained for the limited partners in the VCLP. Carried interest does not include a management or similar fee that the partner is entitled to or a distribution attributable to an equity investment by the partner.  If you are a general partner of a VCLP, your entitlement to a payment of carried interest will be taxed as a capital gain rather than as income. If you qualify for the CGT discount, it applies to carried interest if you became a general partner at least 12 months before the CGT event happened.34  D.  Other Incentives  The IBFD tax research platform states that   [t]he government considers specific incentives for strategic investment projects in limited and special circumstances; for example, where the project will generate significant net economic and employment benefits for Australia, in particular projects associated with locating the headquarters in Australia. Further assistance, including streamlined immigration procedures and assistance with obtaining information, may also be provided.  AUSTRADE provides grants for Australian businesses for export promotion activities. Grants may also be available under the Commercial Ready Program in relation to some early-stage commercial activities.  Specific incentives may be available in the pharmaceutical sector and under the Invest Australia Supported Skills Program. Exporter manufacturers may benefit from the “Manufacturing in Bond” scheme.   32 Id.

Tax incentives are available at all three levels of administration. Individuals and businesses must pay income tax on capital gains at rates ranging from 15% to 22.5%. However, a few exceptions are available to avoid such payments. Individuals must pay annual income tax at rates ranging from 7.5% to 27.5%. The corporate income tax rate is 15%.   Employee share options are not regulated, and taxation requires a case-by-case analysis. Income and capital gains earned in real estate investment funds are subject to a tax rate of 20%. Foreign investment transactions in the country are free, but the Central Bank of Brazil mut be provided with information regarding foreign credit and direct foreign investment operations.   Brazil has four types of free trade zones, which have tax, administrative, and currency exchange incentives. Currently, Brazil has signed tax treaties with 37 countries to avoid double taxation and prevent tax evasion.   I.  Introduction  The most widespread conception of tributos (taxes)—and the one which the Federal Supreme Court apparently has currently adopted—distinguishes five tax types, that is, five different ways for the state to compulsorily demand a pecuniary contribution from citizens. They are the following:   • impostos (taxes),  • taxas (fees),  • contribuições de melhoria (improvement contributions),  • contribuições especiais (special contributions), and  • empréstimos compulsórios (compulsory loans).1  According to the Tribunal de Contas da União (Tribunal of Accounts of the Union), which provides the external control of the bodies and managers of the government, the Brazilian tax system is known worldwide for being one of the most complex, confusing, and difficult to interpret in the world. Since the enactment of the Federal Constitution of 1988, an average of 37 tax rules have been issued per  1 Sistema Tributário Nacional, Câmara dos Deputados, https://perma.cc/FKJ9-4LW8.  \fInvestment Incentives: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 17 day. In Brazil, all entities—5,570 municipalities, 26 states, the Federal District, and the Union—are empowered to set up their respective taxes.2   Taxes finance the activities of the government and are divided into federal, state, and municipal taxes.   Federal taxes include   • Imposto de Renda da Pessoa Física (Individual Income Tax, IRPF),  • Imposto de Renda da Pessoa Jurídica (Corporate Income Tax, IRPJ),  • Imposto sobre Operações Financeiras (Tax on Financial Operations, IOF),  • Imposto sobre Produtos Industrializados (Tax on Industrialized Products, IPI), and  • Imposto sobre Importação (Tax on Imports, II).

Free Trade Zones  Brazil has four versions of zonas de livre comércio (free trade zones), which can be defined as geographical areas that have tax, administrative, and currency exchange incentives with the objective of improving economic activities in its territory.93  1.  Free Economic Zone of Manaus   The Zona Franca de Manaus (Free Economic Zone of Manaus, ZFM) is located in the city of Manaus, which is the capital of the state of Amazonas that is situated in the northern part of the country. It was created by Law No. 3,173 of June 6, 1957, and it was initially designed for storage or deposit, custody, conservation, processing, and removal of goods, articles, and products of any nature, coming from abroad and destined for internal consumption in the Amazon, as well as interested countries bordering Brazil or countries that contain tributary waters of the Amazon river.94  Decree No. 47,757 of February 3, 1960, regulated Law No. 3,173,95 and determined that the ZFM was a delegated state service of the federal government, with administrative autonomy and its own legal capacity, without prejudice to its legal subordination to the various ministerial bodies and the  89 Id. art. 40. 90 Id. art. 40 (sole para.). 91 Id. art. 41. 92 Id. art. 41 sole (para.). 93 Osmar Perazzo Lannes Junior, Câmara dos Deputados, Zonas de Livre Comércio no Mundo 3 (Nov. 2015), https://perma.cc/54D2-K3CN.  94 Lei No. 3.173, de 6 de Junho de 1957, art. 1, https://perma.cc/YF8X-N93Q.  95 Decreto No. 47.757, de 3 de Fevereiro de 1960, https://perma.cc/6VM4-FRZ2.  \fInvestment Incentives: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 33 competencies of each of them.96 Within its organic and legal structure, the ZFM was meant to give full and objective execution, in the Brazilian Amazon, to the economic and fiscal policy of the federal government, in the sense of establishing, through the appropriate legal processes, greater and better exchange of commercial business and reciprocal franchising between Brazil and other countries interested in the economic recovery of the Amazonian areas of their respective territories.97  Decree-Law No. 288 of February 28, 1967, revoked Law No. 3,173 and Decree No. 47,757,98 and it redefined the ZFM as a free trade area of import, export, and special tax incentives, established with the purpose of creating an industrial, commercial, and agricultural center within the Amazon, endowed with economic conditions that allowed its development, in face of the local factors and the great distance at which the consumer centers of their products were located.99  The decree-law stated that the ZFM would have an area of 10,000 km2 (about 3,900 square miles) and defined its geographical position.100 In addition, it created the Superintendência da Zona Franca de Manaus (Superintendence of the Free Economic Zone of Manaus, SUFRAMA), which is an autonomous entity, with personalidade jurídica (legal capacity), its own assets, administrative and financial autonomy, and headquarters and forum in the city of Manaus, to administer the facilities and services of the ZFM.101  According to article 3 of Decree-Law No. 288, the entry of foreign goods into the ZFM that are intended for internal consumption, industrialization to any degree (including processing), agriculture, fishing, installation and operation of industries and services of any nature, and storage for re-export, will be exempt from imposto de importação (import tax) and imposto sobre produtos industrializados (tax on industrialized products, IPI).102 Paragraph 1 of article 3 states that the following goods are exempt from the mentioned taxes: weapons and ammunition, tobacco, alcoholic beverages, passenger cars, and perfumery or toiletry products and preparações cosméticas (cosmetic preparations), except  if the products are destined exclusively for internal consumption in the ZFM or when produced using raw materials from the regional fauna and flora, in accordance with a basic production process.103   For the purpose of curbing illegal or uneconomic practices, and by a justified proposal of the SUFRAMA that must be approved by the Ministries of Interior, Finance, and Planning, the list of goods in paragraph 1 of article 3 can be changed by decree.104    96 Id. art.

Western Amazon   According to article 1 of Decree-Law No. 356 of August 15, 1968, the tax incentives granted by Decree-Law No. 288 and its regulation are extended to pioneer areas, border zones, and other locations in the Amazônia Ocidental (Western Amazon), to goods and merchandise received, originating, processed, or manufactured in the ZFM for use and internal consumption in those areas.111 The Western Amazon comprises the area covered by the states of Amazonas, Acre, Rondonia, and Roraima, as established in article 1(§ 4) of Decree-Law No. 291 of February 28, 1967.112  3.  Free Trade Areas  The Areas de Livre Comércio (Free Trade Areas, ALCs) were created to promote the development of cities with international borders located in the Western Amazon and in the city of Macapá and the municipality of Santana, with the aim of integrating them with the rest of the country, offering tax benefits similar to those of the ZFM in the commercial aspect, such as incentives from the IPI and from the Imposto sobre Circulação de Mercadorias e Prestação de Serviços (tax on circulation of goods and provision of services, ICMS).113 The main objectives of the ALCs are to improve the  105 Id. art. 3 (§ 3). 106 Id. art. 3 (§ 4). 107 Id. art. 4. 108 Id. art. 5. 109 Id. art. 6. 110 Decreto No. 61.244, de 28 de Agosto de 1967, arts. 3–22, https://perma.cc/XG3K-C6XF. 111 Decreto-Lei No. 356, de 15 Agosto de 1968, art. 1, https://perma.cc/T9FU-5VLJ.  112 Id. art. 1 (§ 1); Decreto-Lei No. 291, de 28 de Fevereiro de 1967, art. 1 § 4, https://perma.cc/BT9A-FHU9.  113 Áreas de Livre Comércio, Ministério da Economia (Apr. 10, 2017), https://perma.cc/2F7S-89L2. \fInvestment Incentives: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 35 inspection of the entry and exit of goods, the strengthening of the commercial sector, the opening of new companies, and the generation of jobs.114   In the ALCs, good business options are based on investments in local raw materials using tax incentives similar to those of the ZFM or even the installation of wholesale trades of imported products to meet the needs of the local and adjacent populations.115   Currently, the ALCs included in the perimeter of the ZFM model are Tabatinga, in the state of Amazonas; Guajará-Mirim, in the state of Rondônia; Boa Vista and Bonfim, in the state of Roraima; Macapá and Santana, in the state of Amapá and Brasiléia, with extension to Epitaciolândia, and Cruzeiro do Sul, in the state of Acre.116  4.  Export Processing Zones  The zonas de processamento de exportação (Export Processing Zones, ZPEs) are characterized as areas of free trade with foreign countries, intended for the installation of companies focused on the production of goods to be traded abroad, being considered primary zones for the purpose of customs control. Companies that settle in ZPEs have access to specific tax, currency exchange, and administrative treatments.117 For Brazil, in addition to the expected positive impact on the balance of payments resulting from the export of goods and the attraction of foreign direct investment, there are benefits such as technological diffusion, job creation, and economic and social development.118   The special customs regime for ZPEs was established in the country by Decree-Law No. 2,452 of July 29, 1988.119 At the time, this legal instrument authorized the executive branch to create a ZPE by issuing a presidential decree.120 The decree-law created the Conselho Nacional das Zonas de Processamento de Exportação (National Council of Export Processing Zones, CZPE) to, among other activities, outline the orientation of the ZPE policy, establish requirements, and analyze proposals.121   Law No. 11,508 of July 20, 2007, revoked Decree-Law No. 2,452.122 However, the competence of the CZPE was maintained, and the executive continued to be authorized to create ZPEs in less developed regions and subject to the legal regime established by Law No. 11,508, with the purpose of developing the export culture, strengthening the balance of payments and promoting  114 Id. 115 Id. 116 Id. 117 Regime Brasileiro de ZPE, Ministério da Economia (Aug. 4, 2021), https://perma.cc/82PE-ANJ6. 118 Id.  119 Decreto-Lei No. 2.452, de 29 de Julho de 1988, art. 1, https://perma.cc/54AU-QZNW. 120 Id. art. 2. 121 Id. art. 3.

Canada’s tax system is mainly regulated by the federal Income Tax Act and its subsidiary regulations with income tax imposed on individuals and corporations. Capital gains tax is also imposed on individuals and corporations. In Canada, 50% of short-term capital gains on the sale of stock is taxable at the marginal tax rates. Dispositions of qualified small business corporation shares qualify for a capital gains deduction.    I.  Introduction  Canada is a federal system where taxation is a shared jurisdiction between the federal Parliament and the provinces.1 However, the Constitution Act, 18672 grants Parliament “unlimited taxing powers”3 including direct and indirect taxation4 while the provinces are restricted to “mainly direct taxation (taxes on income and property, rather than on activities such as trade).”5  Canada’s tax system is mainly regulated by the federal Income Tax Act6 and its subsidiary regulations “as well by the sales tax, corporate tax and other laws of the provinces and territories.”7 Income tax is paid by individuals8 and corporations at federal and provincial/territorial rates. Corporation tax rates on corporate profits are federal and provincial/territorial.9  Capital gains tax is also determined by the Income Tax Act and section 39(1) defines “a taxpayer’s capital gain for a taxation year from the disposition of any property is the taxpayer’s gain for the year . . . .”10   1 The Constitutional Distribution of Legislative Powers, Government of Canada, https://perma.cc/8YNF-TLXE.  2 Constitution Act, 1867 (Const.), 30 & 31 Victoria, c 3 (U.K.), s. 92(10)(a), https://perma.cc/JK9E-HAT4.   3 George E.

Individual Tax Incentives  A.  Capital Gains on the Sale of Shares  1.  Tax Rate  The sale of shares for a price greater than the purchase price that results in a gain is considered a taxable capital gain. According to tax summaries by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), “[h]alf of a capital gain constitutes a taxable capital gain, which is included in the individual's income and taxed at ordinary rates.”11 Therefore, 50% of short-term capital gains on the sale of stock is taxable at the marginal tax rates.12 The federal tax rates are the following:  0  53,359 15% 53,359  106,717 20.5% 106,717              165,430 26 % 165,430  235,675 29% 235,675  33%  According to PWC, capital property is taxable in the following instances:  • In general, shares in a corporation that are listed on a stock exchange if, at any time in the preceding 60 months:   • 25% or more of the shares of the corporation are owned by the taxpayer or persons related to the taxpayer, and   • more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares is derived from real property situated in Canada, Canadian resource properties, and timber resource properties.   • In general, shares in a corporation that are not listed on a stock exchange if, at any time in the preceding 60 months, more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares is derived directly or indirectly from property similar to that described above for shares of a public corporation.13  2.  Long-Term Tax Rate  In Canada, there is no tax distinction between short-term and long-term capital gains. According to Swan Wealth Management, “[w]hether the capital gain happened in the short or long term is not relevant in Canada.”14    11 Canada Individual - Income Determination, PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC), https://perma.cc/SU6H-MZKY.  12 Canada Individual - Taxes on Personal Income, PWC, https://perma.cc/FSE8-HDRD.  13 Canada Corporate - Income Determination, PWC, https://perma.cc/CM5U-YA4F. 14 Tiffany Woodfield, How Capital Gains are Taxed in Canada, Swan Wealth Management (Aug. 25, 2022),  https://perma.cc/A7E2-ZS7A.  \fInvestment Incentives: Canada The Law Library of Congress 41 3.  Deductions   Dispositions of qualified small business corporation shares qualify for a capital gains deduction or the lifetime capital gains exemption (LCGE).15 According to the government of Canada, “[f]or 2022, if you disposed of qualified small business corporation shares (QSBCS), you may be eligible for the $913,630 LCGE.”16 A share is considered to be a qualified small business corporation share if all the following conditions are met:  • at the time of sale, it was a share of the capital stock of a small business corporation and it was owned by you, your spouse or common-law partner, or a partnership of which you were a member • throughout that part of the 24 months immediately before the share was disposed of, while the share was owned by you, a partnership of which you were a member, or a person related to you, it was a share of a Canadian-controlled private corporation and more than 50% of the fair market value of the assets of the corporation were: o used mainly in an active business carried on primarily in Canada by the Canadian-controlled private corporation, or by a related corporation o certain shares or debts of connected corporations o a combination of these two types of assets • throughout the 24 months immediately before the share was disposed of, no one owned the share other than you, a partnership of which you were a member or person related to you.17  B.  Capital Gains on the Sale of Shares in Mutual Funds  According to the Canada Revenue Agency, “[w]hen you sell or redeem your mutual fund units or shares, you may have a capital gain or a capital loss. Generally, half of your capital gain or capital loss becomes the taxable capital gain or allowable capital loss.”18 To calculate your capital gain you have to subtract the total of the adjusted cost base (ACB) of your units or shares, and “any outlays and expenses you incurred to sell it, from the proceeds of disposition.”19  C.  Tax on Dividend Income  Dividend income is taxable by both federal and provincial taxes. The tax rate depends on whether the dividend is considered eligible, non-eligible, or foreign. An eligible dividend is a “taxable dividend that is paid by a Canadian corporation to an individual that is also Canadian that the corporation designated as eligible under section 89(14) of the income tax act” and is taxed at 15.0198%. Non-eligible dividends generally come from private corporations that are taxed at 9.031%.20    15 Which Capital Gains are Eligible for the Capital Gains Deduction?, Government of Canada, https://perma.cc/SB24-BQFV.  16 What is the Capital Gains Deduction Limit?, Government of Canada, https://perma.cc/F26R-YV7L.  17 Definitions For Capital Gains Deduction, Government of Canada, https://perma.cc/W67V-M78W.  18 Tax Treatment of Mutual Funds for Individuals, Canada Revenue Agency, https://perma.cc/V5AG-L2E6.  19 Id.  20 A Simple Guide to Dividend Taxes in Canada, Spring Financial (Apr. 4, 2023), https://perma.cc/TY5K-HJBJ.  \fInvestment Incentives: Canada The Law Library of Congress 42 Dividend income can qualify for a federal or provincial tax credit.21  According to Spring Financial,  [e]ssentially, the dividend tax credit is given to Canadian shareholders to apply against their tax liability on the grossed up part of their dividends. How it works is it applies along with provincial tax credits to any dividends received. The amounts depend on whether you have eligible dividends, non-eligible dividends or a combination of both. The reason that the dividend tax credit is issued is to avoid double taxation since the Canadian corporation that issued the dividend already paid taxes on the income that they received. The rates given to eligible and non-eligible tax credits [are] based on what the corporation would have paid in tax.22  D.  Tax on Foreign or Offshore Income  Section 94.1 of the Income Tax Act has the offshore investment fund property rules (OIFP Rules). The OIFP Rules are “anti-avoidance rules intended to discourage taxpayers from investing in investment funds situated outside of Canada in order to reduce or defer their liabilities for Canadian tax.” In summary form the OIFP Rules apply where 1. a taxpayer acquires an interest (“Offshore Property“) in a foreign entity (other than a “controlled foreign affiliate”), 2. the investment can reasonably be considered to derive its value, directly or indirectly, principally from certain “portfolio investments” of the foreign entity (or any other non-resident person) (the “Portfolio Test“), and 3. it may reasonable be concluded that one of the main reasons for the taxpayer investing in the Offshore Property was to derive a benefit from portfolio investments in such a manner that the taxes, if any, on the income, profits and gains from such portfolio investments for any particular year are significantly less than the tax that would have been payable under Part I of the Tax Act if the income, profit and gains had been earned directly by the taxpayer (the “Motive Test“).23  According to PWC,   [t]he offshore investment fund rules affect Canadian residents that have an interest as a beneficiary in these funds. If the rules apply, the taxpayer will be required to include in its income an amount generally determined as the taxpayer’s cost of the investment multiplied by a prescribed income percentage (i.e. the prescribed rate of interest plus 2%) less any income received from the investment.24   The Foreign Accrual Property Income (FAPI) regime is a set of rules aimed at curtailing earning property income (i.e.: rents, royalties, interest, and dividends) or passive income “in a foreign  21 Line 40425 – Federal Dividend Tax Credit, Canada Revenue Agency, https://perma.cc/J8AR-F892.  22 Spring Financial, supra note 20.  23 Michael Friedman, Offshore Investment Fund Property Rules Clarified by the Tax Court, McMillan LLP (July 2016), https://perma.cc/N5D4-YSQ9.  24 Canada Corporate - Income Determination, supra note 13.  \fInvestment Incentives: Canada The Law Library of Congress 43 jurisdiction where a Canadian resident taxpayer controls the foreign entity earning the income.”25 According to PWC,  [a] grossed-up deduction is available for foreign income or profits taxes and WHTs paid in respect of the income. A foreign corporation is considered to be a foreign affiliate of a Canadian individual if the Canadian individual owns, directly or indirectly, at least 1% of any class of the outstanding shares of the foreign corporation and the Canadian individual, alone or together with related persons, owns, directly or indirectly, at least 10% of any class of the outstanding shares of that foreign corporation. The foreign affiliate will be a controlled foreign affiliate if certain conditions are met (e.g. more than 50% of the voting shares are owned, directly or indirectly, by a combination of the Canadian individual, persons dealing at non-arm’s length with the Canadian individual, a limited number of Canadian resident shareholders, and persons dealing at non-arm’s length with such Canadian resident shareholders).26  E.  Tax on Employee Stock Options  According to the Canadian Revenue Agency, “[w]hen a corporation agrees to sell or issue its shares to an employee, or when a mutual fund trust grants options to an employee to acquire trust units, the employee may receive a taxable benefit.”27   However, the employee can claim a deduction under section 110(1)(d) of the Income Tax Act and it is “available where the shares are prescribed shares and the value of the shares when the stock option was granted was not more than the exercise price.”28  All of the following conditions must be met: • A qualifying person agreed to sell or issue to the employee shares of its capital stock or the capital stock of another corporation that it does not deal with at arm's length, or agreed to sell or issue units of a mutual fund trust • The employee dealt at arm's length with these qualifying persons right after the agreement was made • If the security is a share, it is a prescribed share (as defined in the Income Tax Regulations) and if it is a unit, it is a unit of a mutual fund trust • The price of the share or unit is not less than its fair market value (FMV) when the agreement was made • There are additional conditions where an employee receives cash instead of acquiring securities (see Cash-outs), and where the security options are granted on or after July 1, 2021 (see Annual vesting limit).29  25 Earning Investment Income Through a Non-Canadian Entity Introduction to the FAPI Regime, Crow Soberman LLP (Oct. 5, 2022), https://perma.cc/PQF5-RD92.  26 Canada Individual - Income Determination, supra note 11.  27 Security Options, Government of Canada, https://perma.cc/EP39-NDBK.; See also What Is a Security (stock) Options Taxable Benefit, Government of Canada, https://perma.cc/796J-F4GP.  28 Joseph Bonvillain, Tax Benefits and Incentives of CCPC Employee Stock Options, Company Stock Options by Canadian Private Companies, Manning Elliott LLP (Feb. 24, 2017), https://perma.cc/A58M-B9WV.   29 Option Benefit Deductions, Government of Canada, https://perma.cc/4G99-WBA6.  \fInvestment Incentives: Canada The Law Library of Congress 44 The deduction the employee can claim is “one-half of the amount of the resulting taxable benefit in the year.”30 If a stock option plan pertains to shares of a Canadian-controlled private corporation (CCPC),   the amount of the benefit is normally taxable as employment income in the year of disposal of the shares. In such a situation, the employee is entitled to the above-mentioned deductions provided the shares are kept for at least two years, even if the price paid for the shares is less than their FMV at the date the stock option is granted.31   There is also a maximum deduction for shares of a large corporation, as follows:  [t]he preferential tax treatment applicable to stock options granted after June 30, 2021 is subject to a limit. This limit does not apply to options granted by a CCPC or an employer whose gross annual income (on a consolidated basis) is $500M or less. Under these rules, the stock option deduction can only be claimed with respect to an annual vested amount of $200,000 per employee, determined on the basis of the value of the underlying shares at the time the options are granted. Any stock option benefit from exercising an option in excess of this limit is fully taxable for the employee, with no possibility of claiming the deduction in this respect.  III.  Corporate/Business Tax Incentives  A.  Capital Gains on the Sale of Shares  According to PWC, “[h]alf of a capital gain constitutes a taxable capital gain, which is included in the corporation's income and taxed at ordinary rates.”32 The rates that apply to capital gains are one-half of the rates applied to investment income earned by a corporation.33  B.  Dividend Income of a Corporation   Corporations in Canada are subject to tax on their income. Profits and earnings of corporations are taxed on dividends it pays to shareholders and also subsequently also taxed on shareholders’ income (which can qualify for tax credits to deal with the problem of double taxation). Dividends paid by corporations are taxed as what is called a Part IV tax, which is a special refundable tax, and provincial tax rates that vary,  [d]ividends received by private corporations (or public corporations controlled by one or more individuals) from Canadian corporations are subject to a special refundable tax of 38⅓%. The tax is not imposed if the recipient is connected to the payer (i.e. the recipient owns more than a 10% interest in the payer) unless the payer was entitled to a refund of  30 Id. 31 Stock Options, Raymond Chabot Grant Thornton LLP (last updated Aug. 31, 2022), https://perma.cc/CK2D-VSGS.  32 Id. 33 KPMG, Corporate Tax Rates: Federal and Provincial/Territorial Tax Rates for Income Earned by a General Corporation—2023 and 2024, https://perma.cc/VXL7-8NJS.  \fInvestment Incentives: Canada The Law Library of Congress 45 tax in respect of the dividend. When the recipient pays dividends to its shareholders, the tax is refundable at a rate of 38⅓% of taxable dividends paid.34       34 Canada Corporate - Income Determination, supra note 13.  \f The Law Library of Congress 46 China Laney Zhang Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY As a general rule established under China’s Enterprise Income Tax Law, income received by enterprises from equity transfers are taxed at the same 25% enterprise income tax (EIT) rate as other ordinary enterprise income, while the law grants a 20% preferential tax rate to qualified small and low-profit enterprises and a 15% rate to qualified high-tech enterprises. Dividends and profit distribution generated from equity investment among qualified resident enterprises are tax exempt income. Among other things, income from investment and operation of public infrastructure projects under key state support and income from engaging in eligible environmental protection projects may also qualify for deductions or exemptions.    Income received by individuals from transfer of equity is subject to a 20% tax as a general rule, while most other individual income is subject to tax rates ranging from 3% to 45%. Under the current tax policy, most individual gains generated from trading in stock markets appear to be exempted from individual income tax.   In 2017, the central government regulators issued opinions guiding the direction of outbound investment. The encouraged overseas investments set forth in the opinions, such as infrastructure related to the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, will receive better access to preferential tax treatment and foreign exchange, among other things.   The Hainan Free Trade Port (Hainan FTP) offers a number of incentives to encourage trade and investment. For enterprises established in the Hainan FTP in the tourism, modern service, and high-tech sectors in the encouraged industries, the income derived from their newly increased overseas direct investment is exempted from EIT.   I.  Introduction  This report examines Chinese laws concerning incentives provided for domestic and foreign investments given to national corporations and individuals. It aims to compare these provisions with the capital gain allowances in other countries that tax profits generated from the transfer of corporate stock at a lower rate than ordinary income.  China has two distinct income tax codes that are applicable to corporations and individuals, respectively: the Enterprise Income Tax Law (EIT Law)1 and the Individual Income Tax Law (IIT Law). 2  The State Council, China’s cabinet, has the authority to formulate administrative  1 Enterprise Income Tax Law (EIT Law) (adopted by the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Mar. 16, 2007, as amended Dec. 29, 2018), https://perma.cc/JRR8-P9WS (in Chinese). 2 Individual Income Tax Law (IIT Law) (adopted by the NPC on Sept. 10, 1980, as amended Aug. 31, 2018), https://perma.cc/3XBT-F27X (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/UJZ4-JWQB (English translation). \fInvestment Incentives: China The Law Library of Congress 47 regulations, which include the implementing regulations of the two income tax laws and regulations on foreign exchange controls.   The central government regulators, in particular the Ministry of Finance (MOF), State Administration of Taxation (SAT), and the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), have also issued administrative rules and policies granting preferential tax treatment as well as regulating Chinese investors’ overseas investments. The preferential tax regime promoting trade and investment in the newly established Hainan Free Trade Port (Hainan FTP), which covers the entire Hainan Island, will also be reviewed in this report.   II.  Income Tax Incentives  A.  Enterprise Income Tax  1.  Transfer of Equity  Under the EIT Law, the standard tax rate is 25%.3 Taxable income under this law refers to income in monetary and nonmonetary forms received by enterprises from various sources, including  • income from the sales of goods, • income from provision of services, • income from transfer of property, • income from equity investment, such as dividends and profit distribution, • interest income, • rental income, • income from royalties, • income from gifts and donations, and • other income.4  “Transfer of property” under the EIT Law includes transfer of equity. The implementing regulations of the EIT Law defines income from transfer of property as income received from the transfer of “fixed assets, biologic assets, intangible assets, equity, creditor’s right, or other property.”5 Therefore, as a general rule, income received by enterprises from equity transfer is subject to the same 25% EIT rate applying to income from transfer of real property as well as to other ordinary enterprise income.    3 EIT Law art. 4. 4 Id. art. 6. 5 Implementing Regulations of the Enterprise Income Tax Law (EIT Regulations) (promulgated by the State Council on Dec. 6, 2007, as revised Apr. 23, 2019) art. 16, https://perma.cc/E97M-9ZVR (in Chinese).  \fInvestment Incentives: China The Law Library of Congress 48 2.  Dividend and Profit Distribution  Under the EIT Law, dividend and profit distribution generated from equity investment among qualified resident enterprises are tax exempted.6 Such dividend and profit distributions refer to returns of direct investment made by one resident enterprise in another resident enterprise.7  3.  Other Preferential Tax Treatment  The EIT Law provides that certain income received by enterprises may qualify for deductions or exemptions, which includes  • income from engaging in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, • income from investment and operation of public infrastructure projects under key state support, and • income from engaging in eligible projects of environmental protection and energy and water conservation.8  The EIT Law also grants a 20% preferential tax rate to qualified small and low-profit enterprises, and 15% to qualified high-tech enterprises.9 It further stipulates that industries and projects that are given key support and encouraged to develop by the state may be given preferential EIT treatment. 10  Qualified high-tech enterprises newly established in special zones that are designated by the state for the purpose of international economic cooperation and technology exchange may be eligible for transitional preferential tax treatment.11  There are also numerous policies providing tax incentives based on an enterprise’s sector (industry), size, or locations.12 Such policies include one granting enterprises in western regions of China that engage in encouraged industries a preferential EIT rate of 15%, which is set to remain effective through 2030. 13 According to the current policies for small and low-profit enterprises, in addition to the reduced 20% EIT rate, only 25% of qualified  small and low-profit  6 EIT Law art. 26.  7 EIT Regulations art. 83. 8 Id. art. 27.  9 Id. art. 28. 10 Id. art. 25.  11 Id. art. 57.  12 See, e.g., State Administration of Taxation (SAT), Ministry of Finance (MOF), Announcement on Extending the Implementation Period for Some Tax Preferential Policies (Mar. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/BFP2-B2Z5 (in Chinese). 13 MOF, SAT, National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC), Announcement on Renewing the Enterprise Income Tax Policy for Great Western Development (Apr. 23, 2020), https://perma.cc/J2XH-2Y2S (in Chinese). \fInvestment Incentives: China The Law Library of Congress 49 enterprises’ annual income (up to 3 million Chinese yuan, about US$139,544) is considered their taxable income, which effectively reduces their actual tax burden to 5%.14    B.  Individual Income Tax  1.  General Rule  As a general rule established under the IIT Law, income from transfer of property, as well as gains from interest, dividends, profit distribution, royalties, rental income of real property, and gains realized from the sale of real property are subject to a flat 20% tax. Income from individuals’ business operations is subject to IIT rates ranging from 5% to 35%, while other ordinary income is subject to rates from 3% to 45%.15   The implementing regulations of the IIT Law stipulate that income from transfer of property includes transfer of equity and other property such as negotiable securities, asset share in a partnership, and real property.16  2.  Temporary Exemptions on Gains from Trading in Stock Markets  Under a policy jointly issued by the MOF, SAT, and the China Securities Regulatory Commission that appears to be currently effective, gains from transferring ordinary stocks (excluding specified “restricted stocks”) in the domestic stock exchanges are exempted from IIT, although other taxes, such as the stamp tax, may still apply.17   Gains received by individuals from dividends and profit distribution generated from stocks of listed companies also appear to be currently exempted from IIT, as long as the stocks have been held by the individual for more than one year. For such stocks held for more than one month and less than a year, 50% of the gains will be considered taxable income; for those held for one month or shorter, 100% of the gains are taxable income.18     14 MOF, SAT, Announcement on Further Implementing the Preferential Income Tax Policy for Small and Micro Enterprises (Mar. 14, 2022), https://perma.cc/A4ZG-RFEF (in Chinese); MOF, SAT, Announcement on the Preferential Income Tax Policy for Small and Micro Enterprises and Individual Businesses (Mar. 26, 2023), https://perma.cc/6HSX-UZ27 (in Chinese). 15 IIT Law art. 3.  16 Implementing Regulations of the IIT Law (promulgated by the State Council on Jan. 28, 1994, as revised Dec. 18, 2018) art. 6, https://perma.cc/29A7-DPPB (in Chinese). 17 MOF, SAT, China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC), Circular on Issues Concerning the Imposition of Individual Income Tax on Income from the Transfer of Restricted Stocks of Listed Company by Individuals (Dec. 31, 2009) § 8, https://perma.cc/SA7H-EXKK (in Chinese). 18 MOF, SAT, CSRC, Circular on Issues Concerning Differentiated Individual Income Tax Policies on Dividends and Profit Distribution of Listed Companies (Sept. 7, 2015) § 1, https://perma.cc/T7HU-TWCS (in Chinese). \fInvestment Incentives: China The Law Library of Congress 50 III.  Investment Outside China  A.  Outbound Investment Regime   Chinese investors intending to invest outside China must go through the approval and filing process prescribed by relevant administrative measures issued by the regulators, in particular the NDRC and Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM). The primary measures concerning outbound investment include  • MOFCOM, Administrative Measures for Outbound Investment,19 • NDRC, Administrative Measures for the Outbound Investment of Enterprises,20 and • MOFCOM et al., Interim Measures for the Reporting of Outbound Investments Subject to Record-Filing or Approval.21  Overseas investment flowing from mainland China is also subject to strict foreign exchange controls. According to the Administrative Regulations on Foreign Exchange, any domestic organization or individual that seeks to make a direct investment overseas or engage in the issuance or trading of negotiable securities or derivatives overseas must make the appropriate registrations in accordance with the provisions of the State Council foreign exchange administrative department, i.e., the State Administration of Foreign Exchange.22  B.  Guiding Opinions on Direction of Outbound Investment  In 2017, the central government regulators issued opinions on guiding and regulating the “direction of outbound investment.” The opinions categorize foreign investment into three groups of “encourage,” “limited,” and “prohibited,” respectively.23   Encouraged investment set forth in the opinions include    19 MOFCOM, Administrative Measures on Outbound Investment (Sept. 6, 2014), https://perma.cc/W8QM-52M7 (in Chinese). 20 NDRC, Administrative Measures for the Outbound Investment of Enterprises (effective Mar. 1, 2018), https://perma.cc/DJH3-4727 (in Chinese). 21 MOFCOM, People’s Bank of China (PBOC), State-Owned Assets Supervision and Administration Commission, China Banking Regulatory Commission, CSRC, China Insurance Regulatory Commission, State Administration of Foreign Exchange, Circular on Issuing the Interim Measures for the Reporting of Outbound Investments Subject to Record-Filing or Approval (Jan. 18, 2018), https://perma.cc/CU2C-M9C4 (in Chinese). 22 Administrative Regulations on Foreign Exchange (promulgated by the State Council on Jan. 29, 1996, as revised Aug. 1, 2008) art. 17, https://perma.cc/89KE-DHTY (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/2EKD-KNUM (English translation). 23 General Office of the State Council, Circular on Forwarding the Guiding Opinions of NDRC, MOFCOM, PBOC, and Ministry of Foreign Affairs on Further Guiding and Regulating the Outbound Investment Direction (Aug. 18, 2017), https://perma.cc/54RA-JDCG (in Chinese). \fInvestment Incentives: China The Law Library of Congress 51 • infrastructure related to the construction of the Belt and Road Initiative, • investment that promotes export of advanced production capacity, high-quality equipment, and technical standards, • cooperation with overseas enterprises that specialize in high and new technologies and advanced manufacturing and establishment of research and development centers abroad, • exploration and development of overseas oil and gas, minerals, and other energy resources based on prudent assessment of economic benefits,  • mutually beneficial agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry and fishery, and • commerce, trade, culture, logistics, and other service areas; qualified financial institutions will be supported to set up branches and build up the service network abroad.24  The opinions state that the encouraged overseas investment will receive better access to preferential tax treatment, foreign exchange, insurance, customs, and information services.25   IV.  Hainan FTP  A.  Hainan FTP Law and Regulations  The Hainan FTP offers a number of incentives to encourage trade and investment.26 In 2021, the national legislature enacted a special law governing the establishment of the Hainan FTP, the Law on Hainan Free Trade Port. The law governs trade, investment, fiscal and taxation systems, eco-environmental protection, industrial development, and talent support in the Hainan FTP.27   The Hainan FTP Law grants Hainan’s provincial legislature the authority to enact Hainan FTP regulations in light of the actual conditions and needs of the Hainan FTP. Such regulations may adapt national laws and administrative regulations, as long as China’s Constitution and the basic principles of laws and administrative regulations are followed.28 The Hainan FTP regulations may concern trade, investment, and related administrative activities, according to the law.29    24 Id. § 3. 25 Id. § 6. 26 See 60 Key Policies of the Overall Plan for the Construction of Hainan Free Trade Port, Hainan Free Trade Port (June 1, 2020), https://perma.cc/EJ97-YJKC.  27 Law on Hainan Free Trade Port (adopted by the NPC Standing Committee on June 10, 2021), https://perma.cc/T2NE-TANA (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/P8NV-WBLG (English translation).  28 Id. art. 10.  29 Id.  \fInvestment Incentives: China The Law Library of Congress 52 B.  Reduced Income Taxes   Under the Hainan FTP Law, qualified enterprises set up in the FTP may enjoy preferential EIT treatment; qualified individuals in the FTP may also enjoy preferential IIT treatment.30   Under the current policy, for enterprises registered in the Hainan FTP engaging in encouraged industries, a reduced 15% EIT rate apply.31 The encouraged industries are set forth in the central government’s guiding catalog of industrial restructuring and catalog of encouraged industries for foreign investment, as well as Hainan FTP’s own catalog of encouraged industries.32   There is also a maximum 15% IIT rate for qualified “high-end and urgently-needed talents.”33 Income eligible for such exemption includes income sourced from the Hainan FTP including wages and salaries, remuneration for labor services, author’s remuneration, royalties, and income from business operations as well as income from talent subsidies recognized by Hainan Province.34  These preferential income tax policies became effective on January 1, 2020, and will continue through December 31, 2024.35   C.  Exemption for Outbound Investment   Regarding direct outbound investment, the current policy grants an EIT exemption to enterprises established in the Hainan FTP in the tourism, modern service, and high-tech sectors in the encouraged industries of the Hainan FTP.36   For those qualified enterprises, the income derived from their newly increased overseas direct investment is exempted from EIT.37 The overseas income is the operational revenue of newly established overseas branches or dividend income corresponding to the new direct investment generated from the overseas subsidiaries with a 20% or more equity held by the parent company. To qualify for this exemption, the statutory EIT rate of the invested country or region must be no less than 5%.38  30 Id. art. 30. 31 MOF, SAT, Circular on Preferential Enterprise Income Tax Policies for the Hainan Free Trade Port (Hainan EIT Circular) (June 23, 2020) § 1, https://perma.cc/XQ8A-882R (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/R4NF-ZYR5 (English translation). 32 Id.  33 MOF, SAT, Circular on the Individual Income Tax Policy for High-End and Urgently Needed Talents in the Hainan Free Trade Port (June 23, 2020) § 1, https://perma.cc/9YDW-EM5H (in Chinese). 34 Id. § 2.  35 Id. § 5; Hainan EIT Circular § IV, supra note 31.  36 Hainan EIT Circular § II, supra note 31. 37 Id.  38 Id.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 53 Egypt  George Sadek  Foreign Law Specialist    SUMMARY Law No. 91 of 2005, as amended on income tax regulates tax rates for both corporations and individuals. Apparently, Law No. 92 of 2005 on Income Tax does not offer any tax incentives to investors whether they are individuals or corporations.     Law No. 67 of 2016 imposes a standard Value Added Tax (VAT) rate of 14% as of the financial year 2017/18 on all goods and services. The law also provides a tax incentive by reducing the VAT rate to 5%.   Law No. 72 of 2017 on Investment is the main legal instrument regulating government incentives offered to investors (be they individuals or corporations). The law imposes requirements on investment incentives. It also grants investor exemptions from financial and procedural fees, as well as tax exemption and tax rate discounts. Finally, the law grants special incentives to investors, such as protection from nationalization, the right to import and export without registration with the government authorities, and the right to hire foreign workers. The law does not provide any incentives to investors who invest outside Egypt.    Pursuant to Law No. 83 of 2002, the Free Economic Zones shall have a special system for tax management. An entity called the “Supreme Taxation Committee” supervises the implementation of the taxation system of the economic zones.    Law No. 199 of 2020 imposes a tax withholding of 10% on dividend stocks distributions made by unlisted companies in the Egyptian stock market while imposing a 5% tax withholding on listed companies.   Egypt and the United States entered into a tax treaty on the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to income tax.   I. Income Tax   Law No. 91 of 2005 on income tax, as amended, regulates tax rates for both corporations and individuals. Individual income tax is imposed on the total net income of resident individuals for their income that was received in Egypt or abroad.1   Law No. 26 of 2020, amending Law No. 91 of 2005, identifies income tax rates for individuals and corporations. It exempts individuals who have an income tax less than 15,000 Egyptian pounds  1 Law No. 91 of 2005, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah (official gazette), vol. 23 (annex), June 9, 2005,  https://perma.cc/SY2A-T83V (in Arabic).  \fInvestment Incentives: Egypt The Law Library of Congress 54 (approximately US$487) from paying any taxes while imposing a 25% tax on individuals who have earned more than 400,000 Egyptian pounds (approximately US$12,987) as an income.2  Earned income for individuals per month Tax rate  From 0 to 15,000 Egyptian Pound (EP) 0 % Between 15,001 to 30,000 EP  2,5%  Between 30,001 to 45,000 EP 10% Between 45,001 to 60,000 EP 15 % Between 60,001 to 200,000 EP 20% Between 200,001 to 400,000 EP 22.5%  More than 400,000 EP 25 %  Concerning corporate income tax, according to the Egyptian General Authority for Investment, all types of corporations have a corporate income tax rate of 22.5% on their net profit.3 Additionally, Law No. 92 of 2005 imposed a 2.5% transfer tax on the sales of built real estate or land.4 Apparently, Law No. 92 of 2005 on Income Tax does not offer any tax incentives to investors whether they are individuals or corporations.  II. Value Added Tax (VAT)   Law No. 67 of 2016 imposes a standard value added tax (VAT) rate of 14% as of the financial year 2017/18 on all goods and services. The law provides a tax incentive by reducing the VAT rate to 5% on machinery and equipment that are necessary for producing goods or providing services.5 Moreover, Law No. 3 of 2022, amending Law No. 67 of 2016, provides another tax incentive on goods and services exported and imported by investment projects operating in the economic free zones. The Law imposes a VAT rate of 0% on those goods and services.6   III.  Government Incentives Offered to Investors  Law No. 72 of 2017 on Investment is the main legal instrument regulating government incentives offered to investors in Egypt. Those investors could be corporations or individuals. The law offers investors, whether they are individuals or corporations, an array of incentives, including tax exemptions and discounts rates.7    2 Law No. 26 of 2020, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 19 annex, May 7, 2020, https://perma.cc/WF34-KY6P (in Arabic).  3 Business Facts, General Authority for Investment and Free Zones, Arab Republic of Egypt, https://perma.cc/7C4W-ZGW6 (in Arabic). 4 Law No. 91 of 2005, art. 42.  5 Law No. 67 of 2016, art. 3, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 35 Duplicate (C), Sept. 7, 2016, https://perma.cc/U7TY-998S (in Arabic). 6 Law No. 3 of 2022, amending article 6 of Law No. 67 of 2016, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 3 Duplicate (h), Jan. 26, 2022, https://perma.cc/Y8PQ-946H (in Arabic).  7 Law No. 72 of 2017, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 21 (duplicate) (c), May 31, 2017, https://perma.cc/33DS-S9AR (in Arabic).  \fInvestment Incentives: Egypt The Law Library of Congress 55 A. Incentive Requirements  Law No. 72 of 2017 requires that the investment incentives must not exceed 80% of the paid-up capital of the investment project. The period of discount tax rates must not exceed seven years from the beginning of the investment project.8   B. Financial Incentives   1. Exemption from Financial and Procedural Fees   The Egyptian government, via Law No. 72 of 2017, pledges that there will be no financial or procedural encumbrances pertaining to the establishment or the operation of an investment project.9   2. Tax Exemptions and Rate Discounts   Investors are exempt from the stamp tax, as well as notarization fees for a period of five years. Additionally, no tax and fees will be imposed on contracts of registration of the land where the investment project will be built. Investors must pay just 2% unified tax of the value of all the imported machinery, equipment, and devices required to establish the investment project.10 Moreover, investors receive an investment incentive in the form of a discount off of the taxable net profits. Those discount rates include the following:  • a 50% discount of the taxable net profit for investment projects established in underdeveloped geographical locations in Egypt; • a 30% discount of the taxable net profit of investment projects established anywhere else on Egyptian soil.11   C. Special Incentives   1. Protection from Nationalization  One of the main guarantees offered by the Egyptian government to investors is the non-nationalization clause. Law No. 72 of 2017 stipulates that investment projects may not be nationalized. The same Law continues by adding that investment projects may not be sequestrated, confiscated, or seized through administrative procedures, except under an irrevocable court judgment.12    8 Id. art. 11. 9 Id. art. 4, para. 5. 10 Id. art. 10. 11 Id. art. 11, paras. 1 & 2.  12 Id. art. 4. \fInvestment Incentives: Egypt The Law Library of Congress 56 2. Right to Import and Export Without Registration   Investors have the right to import raw materials, production supplies, machinery, spare parts, and transportation that suit the nature of their investment project without being registered with the Egyptian government authorities that regulate imports. The same case applies to material exported by investors.13   3. Right to Hire Foreign Workers   Investors have the right to appoint foreign workers in the amount of a maximum of 10% of the total number of workers in an investment project. This rate may be increased to a maximum of 20% of the total number of workers in an investment project if there are no Egyptian workers qualified to do the job.14   4. Incentives for Investing Outside the Country  Apparently, Law No. 72 of 2017 does not provide any incentives to investors who invest outside Egypt. However, the government grants investors the right to establish, expand, and fund the investment project from outside of Egypt with no restrictions and with any foreign currency. Additionally, investors are entitled to own, manage, use, and dispose of investment projects in Egypt and transfer the profits of investment projects outside of Egypt.15  IV. Tax System in Free Economic Zones  Pursuant to Law No. 83 of 2002, the Free Economic Zones have a special system for tax management.16 To illustrate, an entity called the “Supreme Taxation Committee” supervises the implementation of the taxation system of the economic zones. The committee’s work is under the supervision of the Special Economic Zones Authority.17 Contesting decisions of the Supreme Taxation Committee takes place at the competent reconciliation panel of the Dispute Settlement Center in each economic zone.18  The following are the income tax rates applicable in all economic zones:   13 Id. art. 7. 14 Id. art. 8. 15 Id. art. 6. 16 Law No. 83 of 2002, art. 25, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 22 bis, June 5, 2002, https://perma.cc/D6YL-Q3MF (in Arabic). 17 Id. art. 26. 18 Id. art 27. \fInvestment Incentives: Egypt The Law Library of Congress 57 • 10% tax on the profits of capital companies, • 10% unified tax on the income of individuals, and • 10% tax on revenues derived from land and nonresidential buildings.19  Profits resulting from a merger, division, or change in the legal form of companies operating in the economic zones is exempt from taxes.20 Likewise, equipment, tools, apparatus, raw materials, supplies, spare parts, and any other material or components imported from overseas by the companies operating in the economic zones are exempted from taxes.21  Some media reports criticize the tax credit and incentives systems of the economic zones. For instance, in January 2017, the Al Youm 7 newspaper issued a report, entitled “Egypt Loses One Billion Dollars Annually Because of the Free Economic Zones.” The report claims that, instead of locating their corporate headquarters in Cairo, investors create corporations in the economic zones to evade paying tax. According to the report, in fiscal year 2015-2016, the Egyptian Investment Authority received fees from economic zone investors equal to US$119 million. However, the estimated tax loss due to the tax incentives and credit system offered to establishments operating in the economic zones was US$432 million. The report concludes that the Egyptian economy lost US$313 million that fiscal year as a result. Finally, the report alleges that, due to the tax exemption of profits resulting from the merger, division, or change in the legal form of companies operating in the economic zones, Egypt loses US$1 billion annually.22   V. Tax on Dividend   Law No. 199 of 2020 imposes a tax withholding of 10% on dividend distributions made by unlisted companies on the Egyptian stock market. The tax rate on dividend distributions made by companies listed on the Egyptian stock market is 5%.23  VI. Tax Treaties with the United States   Egypt and the United States entered into a tax treaty, entitled “A Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income.” The treaty was signed in Cairo, Egypt on August 24, 1980, and entered into force on December 31, 1981.24   19 Id. art. 37. 20 Id. art. 40.  21 Id. art. 42. 22 Mona Diya, Egypt Loses One Billion Dollars Annually Due to Free Zones, Al Youm 7 (Jan. 3, 2017), https://perma.cc/4DMG-SUUU (in Arabic).  23 Law No. 199 of 2020, art. 46 (duplicate) ( 2), al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 39 duplicate, Sept. 30, 2020, https://perma.cc/A66U-CQ29.  24 A Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the Arab Republic of Egypt for the Avoidance of Double Taxation and the Prevention of Fiscal Evasion with Respect to Taxes on Income, US-Egypt, Dec. 31, 1981, 33 U.S.T. 1809, https://perma.cc/8JS6-4GU5.  \fInvestment Incentives: Egypt The Law Library of Congress 58  The treaty focuses on the avoidance of double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion with respect to income tax. Per this treaty, both countries agreed that business profits of a resident of one country may be taxed by the other country only if such profits are attributable to a permanent establishment in this country. Both countries also agreed that the same principle applies to individual income tax.25   Taxes covered by the convention are the following:  (a) In the case of the United States, the federal income taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code but excluding the accumulated earnings tax and the personal holding company tax, and  (b) In the case of Egypt:  (i) Tax on income derived from immovable property (including the land tax, the building tax, and the ghaffir tax); (ii) Tax on income from movable capital; (iii) Tax on commercial and industrial profits; (iv) Tax on wages, salaries, indemnities, and pensions; (v) Tax on profits from liberal professions and all other noncommercial professions; (vi) General income tax; (vii) Defense tax; (viii) National security tax; (ix) War tax; and (x) Supplementary taxes imposed as a percentage of taxes mentioned above.26  Finally, the above-mentioned treaty will remain in force indefinitely unless Egypt or the United States decides to terminate it. Both countries have the right to terminate this treaty at any time after five years from the date on which it enters into force.27          25 Id.

Capital gains realized by private individuals on the sale of movable property, as part of the management of their private assets, are in principle subject to a specified income tax rate, plus social security contributions. However, certain capital gains are subject to specific rules, especially gains on the sale of securities and corporate rights.   Gains on securities subject to capital gains tax on the sale of securities and corporate shares are automatically subject to the single flat-rate withholding tax. However, taxpayers may opt to be taxed according to the progressive income tax scale, which enables them, where applicable, to benefit from proportional allowances for length of ownership. In addition, certain funds enable individual subscribers to benefit, under certain conditions, from an income tax exemption on income and capital gains realized within the fund, as well as on capital gains realized on the sale or redemption of fund shares. There are also income tax exemptions for beneficiaries of employee share plans that meet certain requirements.  In terms of corporate incentives, companies subject to corporate income tax cannot, as a general rule, deduct dividends from their income. However, when the special parent company regime applies, dividends received from the subsidiary during the year by the parent company may be deducted from the parent company’s total net income, after deduction of a share of costs and expenses equal to 5%. Most capital gains and losses realized by companies are treated as ordinary income tax. Only capital gains realized on certain securities in the portfolio are covered by the long-term regime. Companies that employ fewer than 250 people, generate annual sales of less than €50 million (approx. US$54.9 million), and are located in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Mayotte, Martinique or La Réunion, are eligible for a tax deduction scheme. SMEs meeting certain conditions may qualify for the status of Young Innovative Company, which gives entitlement to tax benefits. Certain industrial, commercial, craft, or agricultural companies that incur research or innovation expenses are eligible for a tax credit.  A tax treaty between the US and France was executed in 1994, and amended in 2004, and again in 2009.   I.  Introduction  The French tax system relies on compulsory levies that include taxes (impôts), fees for services rendered (redevances), customs duties (droits de douane), and social security contributions (cotisations sociales). 1   1 Direction Générale des Finances Publiques, Présentation de la Fiscalité Française, https://perma.cc/SMT3-XZ63. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 60 Taxes are pecuniary benefits payable by individuals and businesses according to their ability to pay, without any fixed consideration, in order to cover public expenditure and achieve economic and social objectives set by the public authorities.2 Fees for services rendered are payable for the use of certain public services or in return for the right to use them.3 Customs duties have an economic nature and aim to protect the internal market.4 Finally, social security contributions are not taxes insofar as they are levied for a specific purpose - social protection - and the payment of benefits is the counterpart.5  The necessity of taxes is affirmed by article 13 of the Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen of August 26, 1789.6 The same article establishes the principle of equal contribution of all citizens according to their means.7 Citizens shall have the right to determine, by themselves or through their representatives, the necessity of public contribution, to consent to it freely, to monitor its use, and to determine its amount, basis, collection and duration.8 Unlike other compulsory levies, taxes can only be established and collected by virtue of an act of the legislative power.9 Adopted laws are consolidated in the General Tax Code (Code Général des Impôts or CGI).10   Two taxes are levied on profits or income: corporate income tax and income tax. As a general rule, a 25% (or 15%) corporate income tax applies to all taxable profits or income earned in France by corporations and other legal entities.11 Income tax, on the other hand, applies only to individuals.   II.  Individual Incentives  A. Capital Gains Tax vs. Ordinary Income Tax Rates  1.  Income Tax  Income tax is a progressive tax payable by individuals. Income tax may apply to the profits of certain legal entities, but in this case, it is assessed in the name of their members and not of the company itself.12 This system applies to partnerships and similar entities, whose individual  2 Id. 3 Id. 4 Id. 5 Id. 6 Declaration of the Rights of Man and of the Citizen (Aug. 26, 1789), art. 13, https://perma.cc/8TB2-XYS9.  7 Id. 8 Id. art. 14.  9 French Constitution of October 4, 1958, art. 34, https://perma.cc/ND7G-9ZMW.  10 General Tax Code (CGI), https://perma.cc/U3AT-6B9M (in French).  11 CGI art. 219.  12 Id. arts. 8, 238, 239. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 61 partners are personally liable for income tax on the share of corporate profits, even undistributed profits, corresponding to their rights in the company.13  The tax base is, in principle, the taxpayer’s overall net annual income.14 It is obtained by first determining the net income of the various categories according to the rules specific to each, and then subtracting from the total the deficits, expenses and allowances to be deducted from overall income.15 In addition, the amount of tax payable may be reduced by the application of tax reductions or credits, granted to offset certain expenses or investments made by taxpayers.16 Finally, the family quotient (quotient familial) system divides each taxpayer’s taxable income into a number of shares, depending on their marital status (single, married or civil union, separated or divorced, widowed) and the number of people considered as dependents for tax purposes.17  The following income tax rates applied to 2022 incomes18:  Taxable income                 Tax rate €0 to €10,777  (approx. US$0 to US$11,826)     0% €10,777 to €27,478  (approx. US$11,826 to US$30,152)    11% €27,478 to €78,750 (approx. US$30,152 to US$86,412)    30% €78,750 to €168,994 (approx. US$86,412 to US$185,437)    41% €168,994 and more (approx. US$185,437 and more)    45%  2.  Capital Gains Tax  Capital gains realized by private individuals on the sale of movable property, as part of the management of their private assets, are in principle subject to income tax at the rate of 19%, plus social security contributions.19 However, certain capital gains are subject to specific rules, especially gains on the sale of securities and corporate rights.   Gains on securities subject to capital gains tax on the sale of securities and corporate shares are automatically subject to the single flat-rate withholding tax (prélèvement forfaitaire unique or PFU).20 PFU is a flat tax rate of 12.8%.21 In addition, 17.2% of social security contributions must be added.22   13 Id.  14 Id. art. 1A. 15 Id. arts. 12, 13, 156. 16 Id. 17 Id. arts. 193-196. 18 Id. art. 197. 19 Id. art. 150 UA. 20 Id. arts. 150-0 A to F, 200 A. 21 Id. art. 200 A. 22 Social Security Code art.

The allowance applied is equal to  • 50% of the amount of net gains or distributions when the securities or share rights have been held for at least two years and less than eight years at the date of sale or distribution,24 • 65% when the securities or rights have been held for at least eight years.25  Capital gains on the sale of shares in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) established less than 10 years ago are eligible, under certain conditions, for an enhanced proportional allowance. The company issuing the securities or rights sold must meet the following conditions:  • be an SME within the meaning of European Union law,26 • have been in existence for less than ten years and not be the result of a merger, restructuring, expansion or takeover of pre-existing businesses,27 • grant subscribers only the rights resulting from their status as associates or shareholders, to the exclusion of any other benefit or capital guarantee,28  • be subject to corporate income tax or an equivalent tax,29 • have its registered office in a member state of the European Economic Area,30 and • be engaged in a commercial, industrial, craft, liberal or agricultural activity.31   If the above conditions are met, the enhanced allowance, applied to the amount of the net gain, is equal to  • 50% when the securities or rights have been held for at least one year and less than four years at the date of sale,32  23 CGI art. 150-0 D. 24 Id. 25 Id. 26 Id. 27 Id. 28 Id. 29 Id. 30 Id. 31 Id. 32 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 63 • 65% when the securities or rights have been held for at least four years and less than eight years,33 • 85% when the securities or rights have been held for at least eight years.34  B. Realization Requirement  The French tax authorities consider that the taxable event is the transfer of ownership for payment of the securities, corporate rights, or similar rights. However, there are exceptions, and the taxpayer may, under certain conditions, defer taxation.35   C. Wealth Tax  The tax on real estate wealth (impôt sur la fortune immobilière or IFI) is payable by individuals whose real estate assets, assessed globally at the level of the various persons subject to a joint declaration, exceed a certain threshold on January 1.36 This threshold is currently set at €1,300,000 (approx. US$1,426,490).37 This tax only applies to individuals.38  All property and real estate rights belonging to the taxpayer and members of his or her tax household fall within the scope of the IFI. This includes  • built property, regardless of its use (primary or secondary residence, residential or professional use),39 • non-built property (land, woods, and forests),40 • rights in rem in real estate (usufruct, right of use, right of the lessee of a construction lease, etc.),41 and • buildings under construction.42   33 Id. 34 Id. 35 Direction Générale des Finances Publiques, Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques BOI-RPPM-PVBMI-30-10-10, RPPM – Plus-values sur biens meubles incorporels – Modalités d’imposition – Fait générateur – Règles générales de détermination du fait générateur (Dec. 20, 2019), https://perma.cc/DTC8-VQU9.  36 CGI art. 964. 37 Id. 38 Id. 39 Id. art. 965. 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 64 Shares in companies are, in principle, taxable up to the fraction of their value representing real estate assets or rights held directly or indirectly by the company.43 However, certain assets are not included in the taxable base, such as real estate assets or rights held directly by the company or by a subsidiary and used by the company that holds them for its own operating activities.44  Certain expenses are eligible for deduction, for example,  • expenditure on the acquisition of property or real estate rights,45 • repair and maintenance expenses actually incurred by the owner, including those paid by the owner on behalf of the tenant and for which reimbursement has not been obtained by December 31 of the year of the tenant's departure,46 • improvement, construction, reconstruction, or extension expenses.47  When the net asset value exceeds the threshold, it is taxed in accordance with the following scale48:  Fraction of taxable net asset value               Tax rate Under €800,000  (Under approx.

Under certain conditions, they are taxed as capital gains or as wages and salaries. To benefit from the capital gains tax regime for individuals, employees or managers working in the companies or funds concerned must receive normal remuneration, and must have subscribed to or acquired the shares at a price corresponding to their value.51   Carried-interest shares must be identified as such, constitute a long-term investment, and represent  • at least 1% of the total amount of subscriptions in the entity that is less than or equal to one billion euros,52 and • at least 0.5% of the total amount of subscriptions in the entity exceeding one billion euros.53  E. Employee-Owned Share Plans and Stock Options Taxation  1.  Employee-Owned Share Plans  Employee savings plans are optional collective savings schemes that enable employees, with the help of the company, to build up a portfolio of securities.54 They may take the form of a company savings plan (plan d’épargne d’entreprise or PEE).  The PEE is financed by voluntary contributions from the member, plus a matching contribution from the company.55 Under certain conditions, companies may also make unilateral payments for the acquisition of shares or investment certificates issued by the company or by a company included in the same scope of consolidation or combination of accounts.56 Lastly, the company may also make payments under the capital gainsharing scheme.57  Amounts paid by companies that have set up a PEE are deductible from taxable profits provided that they meet the following requirements58:  • payments corresponding to the employer’s contribution are limited, per beneficiary and per year, to 8% of the annual social security ceiling (plafond annuel de la Sécurité sociale, or PASS -  51 Id. art. 163 quinquies C. 52 Id. 53 Id. 54 Labor Code art.

US$48,272) in 202359) without exceeding three times the beneficiary’s contribution,60 • unilateral payments for the acquisition of shares or investment certificates are capped at 2% of the annual social security ceiling, and are taken into account when assessing compliance with the above-mentioned contribution ceiling.61 • payments made under the employee profit-sharing contract may not exceed 30% of the annual social security ceiling per beneficiary per year, and are not taken into account when determining compliance with the contribution ceiling.62  Within the same limits, these sums are also exempt from income tax for the beneficiary, provided that they remain in the savings plan for at least five years, subject to authorized exceptions.63   2.  Stock Options  With regard to the discount, there is an income tax exemption on the fraction of the discount that does not exceed 5% of the value of the shares.64 The excess rebate, which exceeds this 5% threshold, constitutes additional remuneration taxable as salary and wages for the year in which the option is exercised.65  With regard to the acquisition gain, there are several tax regimes depending on the date on which the options and shares were granted, as follows:  • for shares granted between April 24, 2000, and September 28, 2012, a four-year lock-up period runs from the date the shares are granted. Gains from the exercise of options are taxed at a rate of 30% for the fraction below 152,500 euros (approx. US$167,338) and 41% for the fraction above.66 If the beneficiary holds the option for an additional two years, the tax rates are reduced to 18% for the portion up to 152,500 euros, and 30% for the higher portion.67 If the vesting period is not respected, the gain is taxed as a salary at the progressive income tax rate,68  59 Order of December 9, 2022, establishing the 2023 social security ceiling, https://perma.cc/KT37-XLC6 (in French).  60 Labor Code art.

Distinction Between Taxation Regime for Investments in Real Property and Other Investments (i.e., Stocks)  1.  Taxes on Real Property Investments  a.  Applicable Taxes  As a general rule, all owners of built or unbuilt real estate assets located in France are subject to property tax.73 The tax is payable by the owner on January 1 of the tax year, even if he or she disposes of the property during the year.74 The amount of the tax on built-up properties is the cadastral rental value less a flat-rate allowance for expenses of 50%.75 For non-built properties, the amount of the tax is the cadastral rental value less a flat-rate allowance for expenses of 20%.76  Taxpayers whose property income is less than €15,000 (approx. US$16,460) are automatically subject to a simplified tax regime, known as micro-foncier.77 In this case, net taxable income is calculated by applying a 30% allowance to declared income, to reflect all property expenses.78 As a result, only 70% of property income is taxed.  When it exceeds €15,000, property income is one of the categories of income subject to income tax. Once its amount has been determined in accordance with the applicable rules, it is added together with the taxpayer's other income to form the overall income that will be subject to tax  69 Id. 70 Id. art. 80bis. 71 Id. art. 182Ater. 72 Id. 73 Id. art. 1400. 74 Id. art. 1415. 75 Id. art. 1388. 76 Id. art. 1396. 77 Id. art. 32. 78 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 68 under the conditions indicated above.79 Property income is essentially income from the rental of built or unbuilt properties.80 This income may be earned directly by the taxpayer through a company whose purpose is to manage and rent out real estate assets, or through a real estate investment trust.81   Capital gains realized by individuals on the sale of real estate or rights to real estate are subject to income tax at a rate of 19%.82 However, many capital gains are exempt from taxation by law. For example, capital gains arising from the sale of a principal residence or a property worth less than €15,000 are exempt.83  b.  Tax Reductions or Credit  In certain cases, expenses or investments may give entitlement to a tax reduction or credit, provided that the corresponding expenses have not already been taken into account in determining net income.  For instance, individuals investing in older housing benefit from a tax reduction known as Denormandie ancien.84 The tax reduction is available to individuals domiciled in France for tax purposes. Homes acquired between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, that are or have been the subject of improvement work, as well as premises used for purposes other than housing that the taxpayer acquires between January 1, 2019, and December 31, 2023, and that are or have been the subject of work to convert them into housing, are eligible for the tax reduction.85 The amount of renovation work must represent at least 25% of the total cost of the operation.86 The tax reduction is spread equally over six or nine years, depending on the case, and can be as high as 18%.87  c.  Special Rules   Subject to international agreements, occasional capital gains realized by taxpayers domiciled outside France on the sale of real estate or shares in companies with a preponderance of real estate assets are subject to a specific levy of 19% or 25%.88 The levy applies to   79 Id. art. 14. 80 Id. 81 Id. art. 14A. 82 Id. arts. 150U and 200B. 83 Id. art. 150U. 84 Id. art. 199 novovicies. 85 Id. 86 Id. 87 Id. 88 Id. art. 244bis.  \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 69 • individuals domiciled outside France for tax purposes,89 • legal entities or organizations whose registered office is located abroad, regardless of their form or the place of residence of their associates,90 and • French partnerships and similar companies or groupings, and real estate investment trusts (FPI) in proportion to the shares held by non-residents.91  An exemption is provided for individuals who have transferred their tax domicile outside France and are selling their former principal residence in France.92 The exemption is subject to compliance with the following conditions:  • the seller must have transferred his or her residence to a member state of the European Union, or to a state or territory that has signed an administrative assistance agreement with France to combat tax fraud and evasion, and a mutual assistance agreement on tax collection,93 • the sale must be completed no later than December 31 of the year following the year in which the seller transfers his or her tax domicile outside France,94 and • the expatriate's former principal residence must not have been made available to a third party, whether free of charge or against payment, between the departure from France and the sale.95  A further exemption is provided for non-resident individuals who are nationals of a State of the European Economic Area, or of another State if they can invoke the benefit of a non-discrimination clause, and who sell a home located in France.96 This exemption applies to a maximum of one residence per taxpayer, provided that  • the seller has been domiciled in France for tax purposes for at least two years at any time prior to the sale,97 • the transfer takes place no later than December 31 of the tenth year following the year in which the transferor transfers his or her tax domicile outside France, or relates to a property that the transferor has had free disposal of at least since January 1 of the year preceding that of the transfer.98   89 Id. 90 Id. 91 Id. 92 Id. art. 244bis A. 93 Id. 94 Id. 95 Id. 96 Id. art. 150U. 97 Id. 98 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 70 The exemption is limited to the fraction of the net taxable capital gain that does not exceed €150,000 (approx.

Taxes on Other Investments (Stocks)  Taxpayers who invest in companies may, under certain conditions, benefit from a tax reduction.   For example, the Madelin scheme grants a tax reduction to individuals who make cash subscriptions to the initial capital or capital increases of certain unlisted companies.102 When subscriptions are made directly, the company receiving the payments must meet the following conditions:  • complies with the European definition of an SME,103 • is not involved in any bankruptcy proceedings,104 • has its registered office in a member state of the European Union, Norway, Iceland or Liechtenstein,105 • is not listed on a French or foreign regulated market or multilateral trading facility, except in the case of a multilateral facility where the majority of traded instruments are issued by SMEs,106 • engages exclusively in industrial, commercial, craft, agricultural, or professional activities, • is subject to corporate income tax,107 and • has at least two employees at the end of the financial year following subscription, or one employee if the company is required to register with the Chamber of Trades and Crafts.108   99 Id. 100 Id. art. 244bis A. 101 Id.  102 Id. art. 199 terdecies-0 A. 103 Id. 104 Id. 105 Id. 106 Id. 107 Id. 108 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 71 The tax reduction is equal to 18% of the amount of payments made in respect of all eligible subscriptions.109 However, the tax reduction rate is raised to 25% for payments made from August 10, 2020, to December 31, 2020, for payments made from May 9, 2021, to December 31, 2021, for payments made from March 18, 2022, to December 31, 2022, and for payments made from March 12, 2023, to December 31, 2023.110  III.  Corporate Incentives  A. Tax Treatment of Equities Investment Under Corporate Tax System  1. Tax Reductions or Credits  Income from securities of foreign origin may give rise to a tax credit against the profit or loss of the company which receives it when it comes from a country linked to France by an international convention.111  2. Capital Gains  Most capital gains and losses realized by companies are treated as ordinary income. Only capital gains realized on certain securities in the portfolio are covered by the long-term regime.  The long-term regime applies to the sale of equity securities and securities that are taxed as such when they have been held for at least two years.112 Capital gains on the sale of these securities are tax exempt, subject to taxation at the common rate of corporation tax of a share of costs and charges.113  Capital gains on the sale of securities of listed companies with a preponderance of real estate which have been held for at least two years are taxable at a reduced rate of 19%.114   Finally, sums allocated by venture capital mutual funds (FCPR) or professional private equity and dividends distributed by venture capital companies (SCR), as well as capital gains realized by companies on the sale of these shares, when they have been held for at least five years, are taxed at a reduced rate of 15%.115    109 Id. 110 Law No. 2022-1726 of Dec. 30, 2022, art. 17, https://perma.cc/EHR4-HNMP (in French). 111 CGI art. 220. 112 Id. art. 219.  113 Id. 114 Id. 115 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 72 B. Employee-Owned Share Plans, Stock Options Incentives Under Corporate Tax System  1.  Employee-Owned Share Plans  Employee savings plans are optional collective savings schemes that enable employees, with the help of the company, to build up a portfolio of securities.116 They may take the form of a company savings plan (PEE).  The PEE is financed by voluntary contributions from the member, plus a matching contribution from the company.117 Under certain conditions, companies may also make unilateral payments for the acquisition of shares or investment certificates issued by the company or by a company included in the same scope of consolidation or combination of accounts.118 Lastly, the company may also make payments under the capital gainsharing scheme.119  Amounts paid by companies that have set up a PEE are deductible from taxable profits provided that they meet the following requirements120:  • payments corresponding to the employer’s contribution are limited, per beneficiary and per year, to 8% of the annual social security ceiling (PASS121) without exceeding three times the beneficiary's contribution,122 • unilateral payments for the acquisition of shares or investment certificates are capped at 2% of the annual social security ceiling, and are taken into account when assessing compliance with the above-mentioned contribution ceiling.123 • payments made under the employee profit-sharing contract may not exceed 30% of the annual social security ceiling per beneficiary per year, and are not taken into account when determining compliance with the contribution ceiling.124  2.  Stock Options  The company issuing the shares may deduct from its taxable income the expenses and capital losses incurred by the exercise of the options.125   116 Labor Code art.

Distinction Between Taxation Regime for Investments in Real Property and Other Investments (i.e., Stocks) Under Corporate Tax System  1.  Real Property Investments Taxation Regime  a.  Applicable Taxes  As discussed above, property tax is applicable to legal entities.   In addition, companies and entrepreneurs exercising their professional activity on a regular basis on French territory must pay the business property contribution (contribution foncière des entreprises or CFE), even if this activity is carried out at home or in customers’ homes.126 There are many cases of exemption such as, for example, for farmers or educational establishments.127  If the company does not own a building and rents premises, the CFE will be calculated on the basis of its profits.128 If the company owns a building, the CFE is calculated on the rental value of the real estate subject to property tax that the company has used for its professional activity during the penultimate year.129 Deductions may apply. For example, airports benefit from a 33% reduction.130 In 2024, the maximum amount of the CFE will be €7,349 (approx. US$8,064).131  In addition, if the company will have to pay the Tax on Added Value of Companies (Cotisation sur la valeur ajoutée des entreprises or CVAE) if it generates more than €500,000 (approx. US$548,650) in annual revenue excluding tax.132 The same exemptions as those applicable to the CFE apply to CVAE.133 The tax rate is a maximum of 0.375% of the annual revenue, excluding taxes.134  b.  Depreciation  Buildings in the company’s assets may be depreciated on a straight-line basis.135 This depreciation may, subject to conditions, be deducted from the taxable profit of the company.136    126 Id. art. 1447.  127 Id. art. 1452. 128 Id. art. 1467 A. 129 Id.  130 Id. art. 1518 A. 131 Id. art. 1647 D.  132 Id. art. 1586 ter. 133 Id.  134 Id. art. 1586 quater. 135 Id. art. 39A. 136 Id. art. 39. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 74 c.  Capital Gains  Most capital gains and losses realized by companies are treated as ordinary income tax. Only capital gains realized on certain securities in the portfolio are covered by the long-term regime.  Capital gains and losses on the sale of assets by companies subject to corporation tax are, with some exceptions, excluded from the long-term regime, regardless of the holding period of the transferred assets.137 The result of the sale falls within the regime of capital gains or losses in the short term. Capital gains are therefore included in the ordinary profit or loss for the current year at the time of their realization, which is taxed at the normal rate or, in SMEs, at the reduced tax rate of 15%.138 Losses are imputed to operating income or contribute to the formation of a deficit.139  2.  Taxes on Other Investments (Stocks)  Companies subject to corporate income tax cannot, as a general rule, deduct dividends from their income. However, when the special parent company regime applies, dividends received from the subsidiary during the year by the parent company may be deducted from the parent company's total net income, after deduction of a share of costs and expenses equal to 5%.140  The special parent company regime applies when the following conditions are met:  • the holding company and its subsidiaries are subject to corporate income tax,141 • the holding company must directly or indirectly hold at least 95% of the capital of each subsidiary,142 • the holding company must not be more than 95% owned by another company established in France and subject to corporate income tax,143 and • the financial year of the holding company must coincide with that of its subsidiaries.144  D. Free Trade Zones (FTZ)  Companies that employ fewer than 250 people, generate annual sales of less than €50 million (approx. US$54.9 million), and are located in Guadeloupe, French Guiana, Mayotte, Martinique  137 Id. art. 209. 138 Id.  139 Id. 140 Id. art. 216. 141 Id. art. 145. 142 Id. 143 Id. 144 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 75 or La Réunion, are eligible for a tax deduction scheme.145 This mechanism is called zones franches d'activité nouvelle génération.146  The standard rate of tax relief is 50%.147 A higher rate of 80% is available for profits generated either by businesses located in French Guiana or Mayotte, regardless of their activity, or by businesses located in Guadeloupe, Martinique, or Reunion Island whose activity falls within certain priority sectors.148 For a financial year or a twelve-month tax period, the amount of tax-exempt profit is capped at €150,000 (approx. US$164,595) under the standard system, and at €300,000 (approx. US$329,190) when it qualifies for the increased deduction.149  Various tax incentives also exist to encourage companies to locate in certain geographical areas. To name two of many, there are the Zones d'aide à finalité régionale and Zones d'aide à l'investissement des petites et moyennes entreprises.150 These zones are linked to the implementation of European regulations on state aid. These mechanisms grant, under certain conditions, a total tax exemption for two years, followed by a partial exemption.151  E. Other Incentives  1.  Young Innovative Company  SMEs meeting certain conditions may qualify for the status of Young Innovative Company (jeune entreprise innovante or JEI), which gives entitlement to tax benefits.152 Eligible companies are those that have existed for less than 11 years or, for those created on or after January 1, 2023, for less than eight years.153 At least 50% of their capital must be held either directly or indirectly by individuals, or by certain companies in the venture capital sector, or by associations or foundations recognized as being of public scientific interest, or by public research and teaching establishments and their subsidiaries, or by companies that themselves qualify as JEIs.154  During each financial year, they must incur research and development expenditure representing at least 15% of their tax-deductible expenses, with the exception of foreign exchange losses and net expenses on disposals of marketable securities.155   145 Id. art. 44 quaterdecies. 146 Id. 147 Id. 148 Id. 149 Id. 150 Decree 2022-968 of June 30, 2022, https://perma.cc/4YXR-A4SV (in French).  151 CGI arts. 1465, 1465B. 152 Id. art. 44 sexies-0 A. 153 Law no. 2022-1726 of December 30, 2022, art. 33. 154 Id. art. 44 sexies-0 A. 155 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 76 JEIs can benefit from a period of total tax exemption followed by a period of 50% tax relief, each lasting 12 months.156 These benefits apply to profitable financial years, which need not be consecutive.157  2.  Tax Credit for Innovation Expenses  Certain industrial, commercial, craft, or agricultural companies that incur research or innovation expenses are eligible for a tax credit (crédit d’impôt recherche).158 The same applies to commercial companies engaged in non-commercial activities, and associations subject to corporate income tax that carry out industrial, commercial, or agricultural activities.159  Research activities include fundamental research, applied research, and experimental development (including the design of prototypes or pilot plants).160 These three types of activity must satisfy each of the following five criteria: involve an element of novelty, creativity, and uncertainty, be systematic, and be transferable and/or replicable.161  Research expenses eligible for the tax credit are listed exhaustively by law. They include, for example,  • tax-deductible depreciation allowances for fixed assets, created or acquired as new and allocated directly to the performance of research operations,162 • depreciation of patents and plant breeders' rights acquired for research purposes,163 • personnel expenses,164 and • outsourced expenses incurred in carrying out research operations entrusted to research organizations (public or private) approved by the Ministry of Research, or to experts.165  Innovation expenses incurred for the design of prototypes of new products or pilot installations of the same kind, other than prototypes and pilot installations in the research phase, including when these operations are outsourced to approved companies or design offices, are also eligible  156 Id. art. 44 sexies A.  157 Id.  158 Id. art. 244 quater, B. 159 Id. 160 Direction Générale des Finances Publiques, Bulletin Officiel des Finances Publiques BOI-BIC-RICI-10-10-10-20, BIC, Réductions et crédits d'impôt - Crédits d'impôt - Crédit d'impôt recherche - Champ d'application - Activités concernées (July 13, 2021), https://perma.cc/8VQR-W7P2. 161 Id. 162 CGI art. 244 quater, B.  163 Id.  164 Id. 165 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: France The Law Library of Congress 77 for tax credit.166 A new product is considered to be a tangible or intangible asset that has not yet been made available on the market and differs from existing or previous products in terms of superior technical, eco-design, ergonomic, or functional performance.167  The tax credit amounts to 30% of research expenditure up to €100 million (approx.

The income tax rate for individuals is progressive, whereas companies are charged a flat rate of 15%. In addition, the government levies a separate flat rate tax of 25% on individual investment income. Companies are also charged a trade tax that varies depending on where the company is located in Germany.   In general, Germany does not offer tax incentives for individual taxpayers or companies, with a couple of limited exceptions. Equity awards that employees receive in their companies for free or at a discounted price in addition to their regular salary are tax exempt up to a certain amount. Furthermore, equity awards given to employees in start-ups are tax-deferred for up to 12 years if certain conditions are met. A proposed amendment to the Income Tax Act would make certain changes to the tax-exempt amount and the definition of start-ups.   Companies that conduct fundamental research, industrial research, or experimental development activities in certain enumerated categories are granted a tax-free subsidy of 25% of salaries and wages.   I.  Introduction  All individuals resident in Germany are subject to income tax on their worldwide earned income.1 Taxable income consists of income from the following categories:  • Agriculture and forestry; • Trade or business; • Self-employment; • Employment; • Capital investment; • Rents and lease; and • Other income as defined in section 22 of the Income Tax Act.2   1 Einkommensteuergesetz [EstG], Oct. 8, 2009, Bundesgesetzblatt [BGBl.] I at 3366, 3862, as amended, §§ 1, 2, https://perma.cc/J4J9-CEFC.  2 Id. § 2. \fInvestment Incentives: Germany The Law Library of Congress 79 A separate flat-rate tax is levied on investment income.3  Companies that have their registered office or management board in Germany are subject to tax on their worldwide income and a trade tax.4 Companies that are not based in Germany and do not have a management board in Germany are taxed only on corporate income generated inside Germany.5  A solidarity surcharge must be paid by both individual taxpayers and companies.6  II.  Tax Rates  Earned income tax rates are progressive and range from zero to 45%. The current rates for the 2023 tax year are as follows:7  Taxable income (single taxpayer) (in euros) Tax rate (%) 0 – 10,908  0 10,909 – 62,809 14 – 42 62,810 – 277,825 42 277,826 and over 45  In addition, the German government levies a 5.5% solidarity surcharge tax on all individual income over 35,086 euros (about US$39,383).8 Lastly, if taxable persons are members of certain recognized churches, they must pay church tax.9 The rate varies between the German states and ranges from 8% to 9% of a person’s income tax.10   3 EStG § 32d, para. 1. 4 Körperschaftsteuergesetz [KStG], Oct. 15, 2002, BGBl.

Corporate income is taxed at a flat rate of 15%.12 As with earned income, a solidarity surcharge of 5.5% of the corporate income tax is added, making the total taxable rate 15.8%.13 The trade tax is levied by the municipalities and therefore varies.14  III.  Tax Incentives  In general, Germany does not offer tax incentives for individual taxpayers or companies, with a couple of limited exceptions, due to the principle of equal treatment of all taxpayers.15 The German Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht, BVerfG) has held that the “principle of equality regulated by Article 3.1 of the Basic Law (Grundgesetz – GG) requires for fiscal law that fiscal statutes should impose equal burdens on taxpayers.”16  A. Tax Exemptions for Employee Participation Plans  1. Current Situation  In 2021, the German legislator amended the Income Tax Act to make employee participation plans in companies, in particular in start-ups, more attractive, which in turn “reinforces Germany as a location for funds.”17 Equity awards that employees receive in their companies for free or at a discounted price in addition to their regular salary are tax exempt if the value does not exceed 1,140 euros (about US$1,278) in a calendar year.18 Qualifying equity awards are company shares, loan claims, interests in a cooperative, participation rights, participation certificates, participating bonds, shares in a limited liability company, registered bonds, silent participations, and convertible bonds.19   11 EStG § 20, para. 9; § 32d, para. 1. 12 KStG. § 23, para. 1. 13 SolZG 1995, § 2, no. 3; § 3, para. 1; § 4. 14 GewStG § 1. 15 GG art. 3, para. 1. 16 Bundesverfassungsgericht [BVerfG], 84 Entscheidungen des Bundesverfassungsgerichts [BverfGE] 239, https://perma.cc/6T5Q-E2VT (original), https://perma.cc/ZJ28-AJV4 (English translation). 17 Deutsche Bundestag: Drucksachen [BT-Drs.] 19/27631, at 2, https://perma.cc/7WXQ-Q2F5.  18 EStG § 3, para. 39. 19 Id. § 3, para. 39; § 19a, para. 1, sentence 1, in conjunction with Fünftes Vermögensbildungsgesetz [5.

Proposed Amendments  On April 12, 2023, the German government published a draft for a Future Financing Act (Zukunftsfinanzierungsgesetz, ZuFinG), which would include, among other things, amendments to the employee participation plans in companies.

Income deriving from investments in equity interests in companies and partnerships, equity and debt securities, and real estate, and income arising from the alienation of such interests are subject to the income tax. Generally, the Income Tax Code provides for flat-rate withholdings for the taxation of interest income, rental income, and realization income arising from the alienation of real estate and securities. Income arising from such investments are generally not taxed as net business activity profits, which are taxed in accordance with the progressive tax bracket system for natural persons and at the corporate income tax rate of 22% for legal entities, making the special flat-rate taxes for investment income generally more favorable. Special laws provide additional tax incentives for investments classified as high-value or strategic. Incentives include stabilization of, or exemptions from, corporate income tax.    I.  Introduction   According to statistics from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the main tax categories that contributed to total Greek tax revenue in 2020 (excluding social security contributions) were the personal income tax (6.3% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)), value-added tax (7.8%), and excise taxes on specific goods and services (3.8%).1 The contribution of corporate income tax to the total tax revenue appears to be relatively low (1.2% of GDP), and behind, for example, recurrent taxes on immovable property (1.9%).2  The main substantive legislation of the Greek tax system that establishes the major tax headings is the Greek Income Tax Code (ITC), which establishes personal and corporate income taxes on various types of income, including income from business activities, income from capital, and income from the realization of the increase in the value of certain investments (capital gains).3 The ITC also provides withholding rules that apply to certain taxable events subject to income  1 OECD, Revenue Statistics 2022: The Impact of Covid-19 on OECD Tax Revenues, 1965-2021 105 (2022), https://perma.cc/DJC2-Y8PA. Social security contributions amounted to 12.9% of GDP in the same period. Id. Note that various tax adjustments have been introduced after the 2020 tax year (some of which are referred to in this report), which may have altered the overall contributions of the several tax headings to the revenue.  2 Id. 3 Income Tax Code (ITC), Law 4172/2013, E.K.E.D. 2013, A:167, as amended, https://perma.cc/3G7P-9FBE (in Greek). \fInvestment Incentives: Greece The Law Library of Congress 84 tax. Other laws establish the value added tax,4 a unified property tax,5 and taxes for inheritance, gifts, and lottery winnings.6 Rules of tax procedure are provided in the Code of Tax Procedure.7 The main governmental agency responsible for tax administration is the Independent Authority for Public Revenue (Ανεξάρτητη Αρχή Δημοσίων Εσόδων (ΑΑΔΕ)).   This report covers the tax treatment of income deriving from investments made in equity interests in capital companies and partnerships, equity and debt securities, real estate, and the tax treatment of certain activities incidental to such investments. As the relevant types of income are mainly taxed under the income tax framework, the report will focus on the relevant provisions of the ITC and special laws that provide incentives related to income tax applicable to qualified investments.   For income tax purposes, the ITC makes a distinction between tax residents and non-tax residents.  A natural person who has his permanent, principal, or habitual residence in Greece, or whose center of financial interest is Greece, is considered a tax resident in Greece.8 Additionally, persons who are physically present in Greece for a cumulative period exceeding 183 days within 12 months are also considered tax residents in Greece (with exceptions for persons visiting exclusively for tourism or medical purposes).9 A legal entity that is established or incorporated in accordance with Greek law, has its registered office in Greece, or has its “place of effective administration” in Greece, is considered a tax resident in Greece.10    As a general rule, a natural or legal person who is a tax resident in Greece is subject to income tax on the his/its worldwide income earned in a given tax year, whereas a non-tax resident is responsible for income tax only on the income arising in Greece in a certain tax year.11  II.  Taxation of Income from Capital and Income from Realization of Capital Gains   A.  Taxation of Income from Capital and Capital Gains for Natural Persons  1.  Definition of Taxable Income and Progressive Taxation of Employment, Pension, and Business Income  The ITC subjects natural persons to personal income tax to be paid on their taxable income as defined in the Code.12 The ITC defines income under four main headings: (i) employment and  4 Law 2859/2000, E.K.E.D. 2000, A:248, https://perma.cc/2PBU-TED2 (in Greek), amending and ratifying the Value Added Tax Code, Law 1643/1986, E.K.E.D. 1986, A:125, https://perma.cc/C8J4-CBBC (in Greek).  5 Law 4223/2013, E.K.E.D. 2013, A:287, https://perma.cc/3MB2-PS7U (in Greek).  6 Law 2961/2001, E.K.E.D. 2001, A:266, https://perma.cc/F8ZT-9TSQ (in Greek). 7 Law 4174/2013, E.K.E.D. 2013, A:170, as amended, arts. 1-73, https://perma.cc/6X9Z-V4VD (in Greek). 8 ITC, art. 4/1. 9 Id. art. 4/2. 10 Id. art. 4/3-4. 11 Id. art. 3. 12 Id. art. 10. \fInvestment Incentives: Greece The Law Library of Congress 85 pensions income; (ii) business activity income; (iii) income from capital; and (iv) realized capital gains income. Employment and pension income of natural person taxpayers, and net business income of natural persons and sole proprietorships are taxed in accordance with the following progressive tax rate brackets, subject to the applicable deductions and exemptions provided by law13:  Income (Salaries, Pensions, Business Activity) in Euro Tax rate (%) 0-10,000 (approx. US$0-US$10,953) 9% 10,001-20,000 (approx. US$10,954-US$21,906) 22% 20,001-30,000 (approx. US$21,907-US$32,859) 28% 30,001-40,000 (approx. US$32,860-US$43,813) 36% 40,001 (approx. US$43,814) 44%  Income from capital, and capital gain realization income arising from the alienation of property and equity interests and capital markets instruments are taxed at different rates outside of the regular tax brackets, as will be explained below. The ITC defines “income from capital” as income earned by a natural person and arising in cash or kind in the form of dividends, interest, royalties, and income from immovable property.14    The ITC classifies income deriving from the realization by alienation of the increase in value of immovable property, equity and debt securities (including derivative financial products), equity shares in companies listed or not listed on a stock exchange, and equity shares in partnership as “realized capital gains income.”15  2. Taxation of Income from Capital: Rental Income. Dividends and Interest  The general tax rate for dividend income 5%, and 15% for interest income.16   Rental income from immovable property is subject to a scaled rate as follows:  Income from immovable property (EUR) Rate (%) 0-12,000 (approx. US$0-US$13,144) 15% 12,001-35,000 (approx. US$13,145-US$38,336) 35% 35,001 – (approx. US$38,337 -) 45%  The ITC defines interest income as income arising from all kinds of secured or unsecured debt, including from deposits accounts, government securities, bonds, and any other kind of loan relationship.17 The general rule requires the 15% tax to be withheld at the source by the payor of interest, provided that the payor is not exempted from withholding the tax by law.18 Interest  13 Id. art. 15. 14 Id. art. 35. 15 Id arts. 41-43a. 16 Id. art. 40/1-2. 17 Id. art. 37/1. 18 Id. art. 62. \fInvestment Incentives: Greece The Law Library of Congress 86 income earned from Greek government bonds and treasury bills are exempt from income tax for natural persons and non-tax resident legal person business entities.19 Interest income paid on corporate bonds that are listed on a financial instruments market subject to EU Markets in Financial Instruments Directive 2014 (“MiFID II”)20 or a regulated market outside of the EU that is supervised by an authority accredited by the International Organization of Securities Commissions (IOSCO) is exempt from income tax when earned by non-tax residents.21   The ITC defines dividend income as income arising from shareholder equity or other rights to participate in profits which are not claims on debts, as well as income from other types of corporate rights that gives rise to distributions of profits to the taxpayer by any type of legal entity.22 The 5% tax for dividend income is similarly subject to withholding by the payor at the source under the general rule.23  3.  Taxation of Realized Capital Gains   a.  Income Arising from the Alienation of Equity and Debt Securities  Income arising from the alienation of securities, including shares in a company not listed on a stock exchange, shares and other securities listed on a stock exchange, shares in partnerships, government bonds, treasury bills, or corporate bonds, and derivative financial products, are subject to a general flat-rate capital gains tax of 15%.24 Income arising from the sale of equity securities listed on a stock exchange, however, is taxable only if the taxpayer holds at least 0.5% of the share capital of the company whose shares are being transferred.25   b.  Special Income Tax Regime for Stock Options  The income derived from the alienation of stock deriving from exercised stock options acquired by the employees, partners, or shareholders of a company is taxed as capital gains at the rate of 15% (and 0% if the transferor’s share in the company is less than 0.5%) if the stocks have been alienated after 24 months from the acquisition of the stock options. Where the stocks are alienated before the 24-month holding period, the proceeds are taxed as employment income in accordance with the progressive income tax brackets. In any case, the taxable income is the difference between the value of the shares at the exercise of the option and the gain from alienation.  There exists an exception to this regime for unlisted and newly created small or micro- enterprises (i.e. start-ups): if the stock options are granted within five years of the incorporation of the company, provided that the company has not been formed as a result of a merger, and if the  19 Id. arts. 37/2, 47/6. 20 Directive 2014/65/EU, OJ L 173, June 12, 2014, https://perma.cc/AH5U-B3KJ. 21 ITC, art. 37/5. 22 Id. art. 36/1. 23 Id. art. 64/1. 24 Id. arts. 42-43. 25 Id. art. 42. \fInvestment Incentives: Greece The Law Library of Congress 87 shares are alienated after 36 months from the acquisition of the options, the applicable capital gains tax rate is 5% (and 0% if the transferor’s share in the company is less than 0.5%).  c.  Income Arising from Transfer of Immovable Property, Temporary Suspension of Taxation  The ITC subjects income arising from the alienation for value of interests in immovable property to income tax at the general capital gains rate of 15% of the realized amount.26 The realized amount is the difference between the sale price and the acquisition price adjusted in accordance to a housing price index published by the Bank of Greece, or in cases where the property is acquired through gift, devise, or descent, the amount on which inheritance tax was assessed, which is then reduced by a depreciation factor.27 If the immovable property is held for at least five years before alienation, up to EUR 25,000 (approx. US$27,335) may be deducted from the tax.28 The 15% tax is withheld by the public notary who authenticates the transfer of immovable property.29   The Greek government has suspended the taxation of the capital gains arising from alienation of immovable property until December 31, 2024.30  B.  Taxation of Business Associations  1.  Generally   All capital companies and partnerships that are tax residents of Greece are subject to corporate income tax levied on profits made in the course of their operations worldwide.31 Non-resident companies and partnerships are subject to corporate income tax on profits attributed to activities carried out in Greek territory.32 Profits of taxable business entities are considered to be business activity income, as defined with regards to personal income tax.33 Business entities are moreover subject to the same flat-rate income taxes established under the ITC for income from capital and realization of capital gains, at the same rates generally applicable to natural persons.   The general corporate income tax rate is 22% for business activity income for the tax year 2021 and thereafter.34 Credit institutions that have opted into a statutory scheme that allows them to  26 Id. arts. 41/1, 43. 27 Id. art. 41/2. 28 Id. art. 41/9. 29 Id. art. 62/4. 30 Law 5000/2022, E.K.E.D. 2022, A:226, art. 14, https://perma.cc/BH6F-5F2J (in Greek).  31 ITC, art. 3/1. 32 Id. arts. 3/2, 5/1. 33 Id. art. 47. 34 Id. art. 58/1. \fInvestment Incentives: Greece The Law Library of Congress 88 convert deferred tax assets into final and liquidated claims on the Greek State are subject to a higher rate of 29%.35  2.  Exemption of Intra-Group Dividends under the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive, and Exemption of Capital Gains Derived from Transfer of Equity Interest in Companies Resident in the European Union  In accordance with the EU Parent-Subsidiary Directive of 2011,36 dividends received by taxpayer business entities from companies that are tax residents solely in the EU and are of the type of entities listed in Annex I, Part A of that directive and subject to taxes listed in Annex I, Part B of that directive, are exempted from corporate income tax, provided that the taxpayer has held a minimum of 10% of the capital share or voting rights in the entity paying the dividend for a period of at least 24 months.37  Furthermore, the ITC exempts income arising from a business entity taxpayer’s alienation of equity interest it holds in a company fulfilling the criteria stated above with relation to the intra-group dividend exemption from corporate income tax applicable to capital gains, provided again that the taxpayer has held a minimum of 10% share in the entity for at least 24 months.38  3.  EU Rules and Tax Incentives for Mergers and Corporate Reorganizations  In addition to the ITC’s provisions transposing the EU Merger Directive39 that establishes a common system regarding taxation applicable to corporate mergers, divisions, transfer of assets, and exchanges of shares with regards to companies domiciled in EU member states, the Greek tax system incorporates several incentive frameworks that enable tax-neutral corporate reorganizations in Greece.40  4.  Capital Concentration Tax  Capital companies and business partnerships are subject to a 0.5% capital accumulation tax assessed on any kind of assets transferred to such entities at formation or for purposes of an increase in capital.41 Capitalization of profit and reserves are exempted from the tax.42 There are also exemptions available for companies operating in certain sectors of the economy, such as agriculture, shipping, public transport, and utilities.43  35 Id. art. 58/1(b). 36 Council Directive 2011/96/EU, OJ L 345, Dec. 29, 2011, https://perma.cc/S2KN-U9U2.  37 ITC art. 48. 38 Id. art. 48a. 39 Council Directive 2009/133/EC, OJ L 310, Nov. 25, 2009, https://perma.cc/2GYX-VCKV. 40 ITC arts. 52-56; Legislative Decree 1297/1972, E.K.E.D. 1972, A:217, https://perma.cc/SG4D-6XQV (in Greek); Law 2166/1993, E.K.E.D. 1993, A:137, https://perma.cc/5EP7-L8Z8 (in Greek); see Taxand, Global Guide to M&A Tax 2022: Greece 4 (2022),  https://perma.cc/FJD9-RVFE.  41 Law 1676/1986, E.K.E.D. 1986, A:204, as amended, arts. 17-21, https://perma.cc/ESJ3-GAM5 (in Greek).  42 Id. art. 22/2. 43 Id. art. 22/1-2. \fInvestment Incentives: Greece The Law Library of Congress 89 III.

The rate depends on whether it is considered a short-term or long-term capital gain. Chapter VII of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004, established a Securities Transaction Tax. It is a direct tax on every purchase and sale of securities that are listed on the recognized stock exchanges in India.    I.  Introduction  Indian income tax law is governed largely by the Income Tax Act, 1961, and it contains provisions on capital gains tax for individuals.1 The applicable tax is prescribed by the annual Finance Act.2 Chapter XII (“Determination of Tax in Certain Special Cases”) includes taxes on capital gains. Taxes on capital gains also apply to corporations.   II.  Individual Tax Incentives  A.  Short-Term Capital Gain   In India, capital gains from the sale of shares can be subject to capital gains tax. Capital gains are taxable if following conditions are satisfied:   a) There should be a capital asset. In other words, the asset transferred should be a capital asset on the date of transfer;  b) It should be transferred by the taxpayer during the previous year;  c) There should be profits or gain as a result of transfer.3   The tax rate depends on whether a gain is considered a short-term capital gain (STCG) or a long-term capital gain (LTCG). STCGs are gains arising from the sale of a capital asset held for less than 36 months.4 However, the period is only 12 months for  • shares (equity or preference) listed on a recognized stock exchange in India (the listing of shares is not mandatory if the transfer of such shares took place on or before July 10, 2014),  • units of equity listed on a recognized stock exchange in India (the listing of shares is not mandatory if the transfer of such shares took place on or before July 10, 2014),   1 Income Tax Act, No. 43 of 1961, https://perma.cc/S9EA-N98Q. 2 Income Tax Dep’t, Fin.

If shares on a recognized stock exchange are sold within one year of acquisition, the gains are considered STCG and are taxed at a rate of 15% (“plus surcharge and cess [an added levy by the central government for specific purposes]5 as applicable”)6 under section 111A of the Income Tax Act.7  B.  Securities Transaction Tax   Chapter VII of the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004,8 established a Securities Transaction Tax (STT), which is a direct tax on every purchase and sale of securities that are listed on the recognized stock exchanges in India. According to PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC),  STT is applicable to transactions involving purchase/sale of equity shares, derivatives, units of equity-oriented funds through a recognised stock exchange, or purchase/sale of a unit of an equity-oriented fund to any mutual fund. The STT leviable for such transactions varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based.9  The rate for the tax “varies for each kind of instrument, whether delivery based or non-delivery based”10 and can be found under section 98 of the 2004 Act.  C.  Long-Term Capital Gain   Long-term capital gains (LTCGs)11 are gains arising from the sale of a capital asset held for more than 36 months. However, the period is only 12 months for shares listed on a recognized stock exchange in India and other items as listed above.   No tax is levied for LTCGs of up to 1 Indian Rupee lakh (about US$1,219. If the LTCG exceeds INR 1 lakh, it is taxed at a rate of 10%.  Before the introduction of Budget 2018, the long-term capital gain made on the sale of equity shares or equity-oriented units of mutual funds was exempt from tax, i.e. no tax was payable on gains from the sale of long-term equity investments.    5 Education Cess, ClearTax (June 13, 2023), https://perma.cc/G7RE-E9FD. 6 Tax on Short-Term Capital Gains, supra note 4.  7 Income Tax Act, § 111A(1)(b)(i).  8 Finance (No. 2) Act, 2004 (No. 23 of 2004), ch.

Henceforth, if a seller makes a long-term capital gain of more than Rs.1 lakh on the sale of equity shares or equity-oriented units of a mutual fund, the gain made will attract a long-term capital gains tax of 10% (plus applicable cess). Also, the benefit of indexation will not be available to the seller. These provisions will apply to transfers made on or after 1 April 2018.12  D.  Mutual Funds   The tax liability on mutual funds depends on a number of factors including fund type, e.g., whether it is an equity- or debt-oriented fund. The taxation rate of the sale of shares in an equity-oriented mutual fund are taxed as capital gains as follows:  Equity funds are those mutual funds where more than 65% of it [sic] total fund amount is invested in equity shares of companies. As mentioned above, you realise short-term capital gains if you redeeming [sic] your equity fund units within a one year. These gains are taxed at a flat rate of 15%, irrespective of your income tax bracket.   You make long-term capital gains on selling your equity fund units after holding them for over one year. These capital gains of up to Rs 1 lakh a year are tax-exempt. Any long-term capital gains exceeding this limit attracts [sic] LTCG tax at 10%, without indexation benefit.13  E.  Employee Shares  An employee stock option plan (ESOP) can be taxed at the time of exercising an option as part of the person’s income and sale of shares as part of capital gains.14 According to PwC, the exercise is “taxable as perquisite in the hands of the employee” and the “valuation for this purpose is to be done on the basis of the FMV [fair market value] of the specified security or sweat equity share on the date when the option is exercised (i.e. allotment) by the employee as reduced by the amount recovered from the employee.”15  If employees sell their shares, “[t]he difference between the sale price and FMV on the exercise date is taxed as capital gains.” 16  PwC notes that there is a deferral of tax on shares of eligible start-ups.  Effective 1 April 2020, taxation of any specified security or sweat equity shares that is [sic] taxable as perquisite in the hands of employees of eligible start-ups has been deferred. The tax is now required to be deducted/paid within 14 days from the earliest of the following events:   12 Taxation of Income Earned from Selling Shares, ClearTax (May 22, 2023), https://perma.cc/YLP5-3C9Q.  13 Mutual Fund Taxation – How Mutual Funds Are Taxed?, ClearTax (Mar. 30, 2023), https://perma.cc/X34D-U3T3.  14 Getting ESOP as Salary Package?

This relaxation has been provided to ease the burden of cash outflow on employees of such start-ups arising at the time of exercise of such securities.17  F.  Dividend Income  Since April 1, 2020, under the Finance Act, 2020,18 dividend income is taxable to the investor or shareholder and not the company.19 Prior to March 2020, dividends received by shareholders were exempt from tax because the company already paid a dividend distribution tax (DDT) on it.20 Since April 1, 2020, the DTT on companies and mutual funds has been abolished.21  According to PwC,   [p]reviously, dividend income received from an Indian company was not taxable in the hands of the shareholder if dividend distribution tax (DDT) had been paid on the same by the company. This was applicable to resident as well as NR [nonresident] shareholders.   However, dividend income in excess of INR 1 million was chargeable to tax in the case of an individual, HUF [Hindu Undivided Family], or a firm that is a resident in India at the rate of 10%. Also, dividend income received from an SEBI- [Securities and Exchange Board of India] registered Indian mutual fund was not taxable in the hands of recipient. This applied to resident as well as NR shareholders.   Effective 1 April 2020, dividend will now be taxed in the hands of the shareholders or unit holders at the applicable rates, and, correspondingly, the domestic company or mutual fund will not be required to pay any tax on distribution of income.22  The Finance Act, 2020, also established the Tax Deducted at Source on dividend income and a tax deduction on expenses from dividend income.23     17 India Individual – Income Determination, supra note 15.  18 Finance Act, 2020 (No. 12 of 2020), Gazette of India, pt.

III.  Corporate/Business Tax Incentives  A. Capital Gains for the Sale of Shares  Corporations are also liable for capital gains on the “transfer of a capital asset,” including the “sale, exchange, relinquishment, or extinguishment of rights in an asset.”24 As with individuals’ capital gains discussed in Part II, above, the holding of capital assets can be either short term or long term. Long-term capital gains “are eligible for a concessional rate of tax and indexation of cost of purchase and cost of improvement.”25   Short-term capital assets are “capital assets held for a period of not more than 36 months. In case of listed shares, listed securities, or units of specified mutual funds or zero-coupon bonds, the short-term holding period is not more than 12 months, and in case of unlisted shares is not more than 24 months.”26   According to PwC, capital gains are taxed as follows:  • Long-term capital gains on the transfer of equity shares in a company acquired on or after 1 October 2004 will be exempted only if STT was paid at the time of acquisition.  24 India Corporate - Income Determination, PwC, https://perma.cc/Y7WV-FWJ6.  25 Id.  26 Id.  \fInvestment Incentives: India The Law Library of Congress 95 This exemption stands withdrawn from 1 April 2018. Post such withdrawal, the long-term capital gains exceeding INR 100,000 will be taxed at the rate of 10% (plus surcharge and health and education cess). The said amendment will be applicable to units of equity-oriented funds as well. The benefit of adjustment of cost of inflation index will not be available. In addition, the benefit of computation of long-term capital gains in foreign currency in the case of a non-resident will not be allowed.  • Other long-term capital gains are subject to taxation at 20% (plus the surcharge and health and education cess). However, long-term capital gains arising from the transfer of listed securities, units, or zero-coupon bonds on which STT is not paid are taxed at 10% (without adjusting the cost for inflation) or at 20% (after adjusting the cost for inflation), whichever is more beneficial to the taxpayer. These rates exclude surcharge and health and education cess.  • Long-term capital gains arising to a non-resident (not being a company) or a foreign company from transfer of unlisted securities, shares, debentures, etc. are taxable at 10% (plus surcharge and health and education cess) without any indexation benefit.27  • Short-term capital gains on the transfer of listed shares in a company or units of an equity-oriented fund that are subject to STT are taxed at 15% (plus surcharge and health and education cess).  • Other short-term capital gains are subject to taxation at the normal rates.  • The indexation benefit is available on cost of acquisition and cost of improvement for assets classified as long-term while computing capital gains. The taxpayer will have the option to consider the fair market value of the asset on 1 April 2001 as the cost of acquisition where date of acquisition is before 1 April 2001. This is effective from the tax year 2018/19.28  B.  Corporate Buyback of Shares  Section 115QA of the Income Tax Act regulates tax on the buyback of shares by a company from the shareholder.29 Any domestic company that buys back its own shares is liable to pay an “additional income tax on the distributed income at an effective tax rate of 23.296% of distributed income.”30   Buyback of shares   An additional tax is payable on transactions involving buyback of shares by Indian companies from its shareholders. A tax at 20% (plus surcharge at 12% and health and education cess at 4%) is payable by the company on the difference of consideration paid on buyback and the issue price of shares.

The existing progressive tax rate allows applying lower rates or tax exemptions depending on income and the sector of the economy in which investments are made. The duration of tax incentives also varies. Rebates are used to incentivize investments in securities traded on the Iranian stock exchange. Separate rules apply to investments in real estate and infrastructure. A special tax regime is introduced for free trade zones. Investments abroad and foreign investments are protected and regulated under bilateral international agreements.   I.  Introduction  Iranian tax law incentivizes investment, particularly in manufacturing, mining, and industrial sectors, by offering low tax rates, exemptions, and additional incentives for foreign investments by providing equal taxation treatment under the law, and residential permits for foreign investors and their families. The Tax Administration serves as the official tax authority in Iran, overseeing direct and most indirect taxes.1 Direct taxes include property taxes (such as inheritance taxes and stamp duties),2 and income taxes (such as property, agricultural, salary, self-employment, and corporate income taxes). Indirect taxes encompass Value Added Tax (VAT) and import taxes.3  The core legislation governing direct taxation is the Direct Taxes Act, adopted in 1987 and last amended in 2015, which is aimed at supporting production and investment promotion in line with the country’s economic development, particularly for newly established manufacturing and mineral units and investment promotion.4  The Value Added Tax Act (VATA), approved in 2008,  1 Direct Taxes Act, July 22, 2015, art. 21, https://perma.cc/4SB4-L6GB. 2 Id. arts. 44–51. 3 Value Added Tax (VAT) in Iran is governed by the Value Added Tax Act (VATA). VAT is applicable to the sale of all goods and services and to imports, with specific exemptions outlined in article 12 of VATA.  Exported goods and services through official customs gates are exempt from VAT, and taxes paid for such exports are refundable upon submission of customs clearance sheets or valid documents, as stated in article 13 of VATA. Economic activities conducted in free trade and industrial zones are also exempt from VAT. The tax base for imported goods is calculated on the basis of the CIF (cost, insurance, and freight) value, including the purchase price, freight charges, and premiums, along with specified import duties and charges mentioned in customs documents. Similarly, for imported services, the tax base is the value of the consideration for importation, denominated in Iranian rials.  See Value Added Tax Act (VATA), May 23, 2021, published in Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran on June 7, 2021, No. 22226, and at https://perma.cc/6GNU-889S (in Farsi). 4 Direct Taxes Act arts. 132–141, 143 (bis), 146 (bis), 147–149. See also Incentives and Benefits of Foreign Investment in Iran, Iran Consulate Addis Ababa,  https://perma.cc/D2NP-MXFY. \fInvestment Incentives: Iran The Law Library of Congress 98 and revised in 2021,5 plays a crucial role in the indirect tax framework. The Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA), passed in 2002,6 provides government-backed investment insurance for foreign investors and an equal investment tax and incentives for Iranian nationals. Individuals and entities subject to taxation in Iran are (1) owners, both real and legal persons, in relation to their personal and real estate in Iran; (2) Iranian individuals residing in Iran, on all their income earned in Iran or abroad; (3) Iranian individuals residing abroad, on all their income derived in Iran; (4) Iranian legal persons (companies, organizations, etc.) on all their profits earned in Iran or abroad; and (5) non-Iranian individuals and entities on income or profits derived from activities in Iran, including licensing, rights provision, training, technical assistance, and the transfer of cinematographic films.7  II.  Individual Incentives  When comparing capital gains tax rates with ordinary income tax rates in Iran, there are several key differences to consider. Regarding ordinary income, the Direct Taxes Act stipulates that income derived from services rendered in Iran is subject to tax on salary income.8 The individual tax rates vary, depending on taxable income, with a progressive system in place. Taxable income up to 500 million rials (about US$1,132)9 is subject to a 15% tax rate, while income between 500 million rials and 1 billion rials is taxed at 20%. Taxable income exceeding 1 billion rials is subject to a 25% tax rate. Additionally, individuals experiencing a 10% increase in income compared to the previous year may be eligible for a one-percentage-point reduction in their tax rate, up to a maximum of five percentage points, applicable in the following tax year.10 Notably, article 81 of the act exempts income derived from various agricultural activities from taxes. This includes farming, animal rearing, stockbreeding, fish farming, beekeeping, poultry husbandry, hunting and fishing, sericulture, pasture and forest revival, horticulture, and palm tree cultivation. The regulations for individual income taxes are covered in articles 83 to 92 of the Direct Taxes Act, providing further guidance on taxable salary income, exemptions, appraisal of noncash income, tax rates, obligations of salary payers, refund provisions, and specific exemptions for certain categories of salary income.11  5 VATA, preamble. 6 Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA), Mar. 10, 2002, https://perma.cc/M6AP-BA49 (in Farsi); Iran Consulate Addis Ababa, supra note 4; FIPPA License: How to Protect Your Investments in Iran, IranPartner (Oct. 20, 2017), https://perma.cc/8MKP-2JJY. 7 Direct Taxes Act art. 1; Iran at a Glance, Organization for Investment Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran, https://www.investiniran.ir/en/Iran-At-a-Glance; Taxation in Iranian Legal System, Bayan Emrooz, https://perma.cc/BVK2-4HQX. Additionally, the following individuals and entities are exempt from taxes under the Direct Taxes Act: (1) government ministries and institutions, (2) government-budgeted enterprises, (3) municipalities, (4) foundations and institutions of the Islamic Revolution licensed by the Supreme Leader, (5) companies partially or wholly owned by the previously mentioned exempt entities regarding the portion of the income or profit belonging to them.

A 10% rebate on the tax on income is granted for selling commodities in commodity stocks and for tax on profits for companies listed on domestic or foreign stock exchanges, and a 5% rebate is granted to companies listed for OTC transactions. This rebate is applicable from enlistment until delisting, with the rebates doubled for companies having at least 20% free-floating shares. Additionally, a flat tax rate of 4% is collected on the transfer of shares, partners’ shares, and preemptive rights. Furthermore, article 143 (bis) introduces a flat tax of 0.5%, collected by brokers during each transfer, on the sale value of shares and preemptive rights. The accompanying notes provide additional details, including exemptions for certain income derived from investment funds and securities, acceptance of profits and fees as expenses for taxable income assessment, exemptions for sales on foreign exchanges, restrictions on investment funds’ activities, and exemptions for fixed taxes on securities portfolios and licenses. The provisions of articles 143 and 143 (bis) of the Direct Taxes Act apply to all natural and legal persons (i.e., individuals and businesses). Accordingly, these exemptions and regulations include exemptions from both income tax and VAT for certain incomes derived from these sources.12  Additionally, it is worth noting that articles 52 to 80 of the Direct Taxes Act provide regulations for the taxation of real estate income, including rental income and property transfers. The taxable income from leased real estate is determined on the basis of the total rent minus a deduction of 25% for expenses, depreciation, and owner commitments, with special rules applying to certain types of leases.13 Real estate transfers must be registered and are taxed on the basis of the taxable value, with exemptions and special provisions for specific cases.14  In summary, the capital gains tax rates and ordinary income tax rates in Iran differ. Ordinary income tax rates follow a progressive system based on taxable income, ranging from 15% to 25%, with potential reductions for income increases. Capital gains tax rates involve rebates, flat tax rates, and specific provisions for transfers of shares and preemptive rights. It is important to note that these rates and provisions are subject to the Direct Taxes Act, providing detailed regulations for individual income taxes and capital gains taxes in Iran.15  III.  Business and Corporate Incentives  A.  Tax Rates  Article 105 of the Direct Taxes Act establishes that companies and legal persons are subject to a flat tax rate of 25% on their aggregate profits from various sources, both in Iran and abroad, after deducting losses and exemptions. This rate also applies to foreign companies operating in Iran and receiving income from their activities or investments. Foreign companies are taxed at the same rate of 25% on their taxable income derived from operations in Iran or activities conducted  12 Id. arts. 143–143 (bis). 13 Id. art. 53. 14 Id. arts. 59, 64, 68, 70. 15 Direct Taxes Act arts. 81–103, 132, 143–143 (bis), 145; Emrooz, supra note 7.  \fInvestment Incentives: Iran The Law Library of Congress 100 through branches or representative offices. The tax assessment for legal entities is outlined in article 106, while article 107 addresses the taxable income of foreign natural and legal persons related to Iran. Specific regulations and computation methods for taxable income are determined by the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance.16  Tax exemptions play a crucial role in incentivizing business activities in Iran. Several articles of the Direct Taxes Act provide exemptions for different sectors and entities. Article 132 grants tax exemptions for income derived from manufacturing and nonmanufacturing plants, mineral mining legal entities, hospital services, hotels, and tourist centers. The duration of tax exemptions depends on the respective exploitation license and can range from five to six years. Article 133 extends tax exemptions to cooperative companies and their unions involved in agriculture, rural areas, and educational institutions. Other exemptions are included in article 138, which exempts interest paid to funders of manufacturing projects from taxation, and article 139, which provides tax exemptions for religious sanctuaries, charitable organizations, educational institutions, and foundations.17  Various tax incentives are also available for businesses on the basis of specific criteria and regulations. Employment increase incentives, outlined in article 132, allow manufacturing and service units to qualify for tax exemptions if they increase their workforce by at least 50% annually. Regional incentives provide a zero-tax rate for entities located in industrial or special economic zones for a period of two to three years. Foreign investment participation incentives grant tax exemptions for foreign companies with local manufacturing units in Iran that export at least 20% of their products. Additionally, specific provisions and criteria determine tax incentives for businesses in various sectors and regions.18  Lastly, acceptable tax expenses can be deducted from the taxable income of businesses. These expenses include costs related to goods and materials used, personnel costs, rent, machinery and equipment rentals, fuel and utilities, insurance expenses, research and development, marketing and advertising, and various other business-related expenditures. Article 148 provides a detailed list of acceptable expenses that meet specific conditions. Overall, the Iranian legislation on business and corporate incentives prescribes tax rates of 25% for corporate profits, specific exemptions, deductions, and rebates to encourage domestic and foreign investment and participation in various economic sectors.19  B.  Employee-Owned Share Plans, Stock Options  The aggregate income of companies, as well as the income from the profit-making activities of other legal persons, derived from different sources in Iran or abroad, less the losses resulting from nonexempt sources and minus the prescribed exemptions, is taxed at the flat rate of 25%, except  16 Direct Taxes Act arts. 105–107. 17 Id. arts. 132, 133, 138, 139.  18 Id. art. 132.  19 Id. arts. 148–149; Emrooz, supra note 7; Tax Incentives, Organization for Investment Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran, https://ipa.investiniran.ir/en/Incentives/Tax-Incentives. \fInvestment Incentives: Iran The Law Library of Congress 101 in cases for which separate rates are provided under the Direct Taxes Act.20 Persons, whether natural or legal, are not be taxable for the stocks or the dividends of their shares in other capital corporations.21  C.  Long-Term Rates vs. Short-Term Rates  1.  Realization Requirement  Rules for long-term and short-term tax rates and incentives for capital gains in Iran are different. For instance, the realization requirement applies to residential properties, necessitating the calculation of property or sale taxes only upon the asset’s sale. This grants taxpayers the discretion to select the taxable date of the asset. In contrast, investment properties under the law are subject to an annual wealth tax, the amount of which would depend on whether the real estate investment is vacant or rented; the size, location, and price of the property; or the amount, usage, or price of other assets, unless they are otherwise exempted under specific legislation.22    Furthermore, financial institutions offer incentives for investments, as long-term savings typically yield higher interest rates compared to short-term savings or checking accounts.  2.  Wealth Tax  Individuals can capitalize on the increased value of an asset through loans or mortgages; however, they may also bear the responsibility of property taxes if the asset in question is considered an investment under the law and does not pertain to residential or ordinary usage and is not exempted by other means. There are currently no taxes on financial investments such as bank savings.  3.  Carried Interest  The Direct Taxes Act regulates various types of funds, including private equity funds, venture capital funds, real estate investment funds, Islamic financial funds and construction projects, and commodities and futures funds, for which the legislator has considered different types, durations, and percentages of exemptions.  4.  Taxation Regimes for Investment in Real Property  Investment incentives and taxation regimes differ between real estate and stocks in Iran. The Law for the Ownership of Immovable Property by Foreign Nationals restricts foreign investors from owning land directly; however, it allows ownership through an Iranian company established as a result of foreign investment. In contrast, there are no restrictions on foreign ownership of stocks or corporate shares, with 100% foreign capital allowed for foreign companies.23   20 Direct Taxes Act art. 105. 21 Tax Incentives, supra note 19. 22 Direct Taxes Act arts. 52–80. 23 Iran Consulate Addis Ababa, supra note 4. \fInvestment Incentives: Iran The Law Library of Congress 102 Specific articles within the Direct Taxes Act outline various aspects of real estate taxation. Article 53 provides the calculation of taxable income from leased real estate, which is the total rent minus a deduction of 25% for expenses, depreciation, and owner commitments. Special rules apply to different lease types, and article 54 establishes that the tax criteria for formal or regular rental income are to be used. If there is no contract or the offered rent is below 80% of the determined amount, the tax is based on the value set by the national Tax Administration. Transfers of real estate are addressed in article 59, which requires registration and taxation based on the taxable value. If a transfer is not registered, the taxable value of the nearest similar property is used, with the tax liability falling on the transferee. The determination of real estate property trading values is covered in article 64, according to which the Real Estate Property Commission considers factors such as location, type, and use. Exemptions from the final transfer tax are outlined in article 68 for real estate transferred to the government under certain laws or to public entities. Article 70 provides an exemption from the final transfer tax for the first-time transfer of low- and medium-priced residential units built within specified criteria. Additionally, income from the manufacture and sale of buildings is subject to income tax, with the first transfer of these buildings being subject to a specific tax rate according to article 77.24  In summary, real estate investment in Iran is subject to specific tax regulations outlined in the Direct Taxes Act, and foreign investors have restrictions on direct land ownership. On the other hand, investment in stocks offers more freedom for foreign investors with no restrictions on shareholding percentage and the ability to register companies with 100% foreign capital, which can open the door to real estate ownership as well, in the same scope that is allowed for private Iranian nationals.  IV.  Other Incentives  A.  Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)  Iran can pursue FDI in other countries, according to the specific conditions in each of its bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with about 70 countries, and double taxation treaties (DTTs) with about 42 countries.25   Aside from the details of each of these treaties, the Foreign Investment Promotion and Protection Act (FIPPA) encourages FDI of other countries in Iran by providing the following foreign investment incentives:    24 Direct Taxes Act arts. 53, 54, 59, 68, 70, 77. 25 International Investment Agreements Navigator: Iran, Islamic Republic of, United Nations Conference on Trade and Development Investment Policy Hub, https://perma.cc/EV93-NNGB; Iran at a Glance, supra note 7.  \fInvestment Incentives: Iran The Law Library of Congress 103 • FIPPA emphasizes that the same rules are accorded to domestic and foreign investors.26 • Import of foreign capital, being cash or noncash (in kind), is subject only to the investment license and does not require any other license. • The volume of foreign investment in each individual case is not subject to any limitation. • Foreign capital is guaranteed against nationalization and expropriation, and in such cases the foreign investor is entitled to receive compensation. • Transfer of the principal capital, profit, and capital gains derived from utilization of capital is to be effected in the form of foreign currency or, as the case may be, in the form of goods, as set out in the investment license. • The freedom to export goods produced by the investee firm is guaranteed, and in the event of any prohibition on the export, the goods produced may be sold in the domestic market, and proceeds of sale are to be transferable abroad in the form of foreign currency through the country’s official monetary network. • Investment may be made in all areas where private sector activity is permitted . • There is no restriction on the percentage of foreign shareholding. • A renewable three-year residence permit may be issued to foreign investors, directors, experts, and their immediate family members.27  B.  Free-Trade Zones (FTZs)  According to the Direct Taxes Act and other relevant Iranian laws, investment facilities and incentives in free-trade and industrial zones are as follows:  • 20 years’ tax exemption for all economic activities. • No visa requirement for the entrance of foreigners. • No limitation on transferring foreign currency. • Flexible monetary and banking services. • Exemption of raw materials and industrial machinery of producing units from customs duty. • Easy registration of companies, industrial and cultural institutions, and intellectual property ownership. • Economic activities conducted in free-trade and industrial zones are exempt from VAT. • Easy circumstances for reexport and transit of commodities.  26 The same rules apply to domestic and foreign investors, except in the Law for the Ownership of Immovable Property, which provides limitations on ownership or sale of real estate by foreign nationals. These limitations can be resolved by the foreign national registering as an Iranian corporation or obtaining Iranian residency through investing more than a certain amount in Iran in accordance with Iranian laws. 27 Capital Protection, Organization for Investment, Economic and Technical Assistance of Iran,  https://ipa.investiniran.ir/en/Incentives/Capital-Protection; Iran Consulate Addis Ababa, supra note 4.   \fInvestment Incentives: Iran The Law Library of Congress 104 • Easy regulations for the import of commodities allowed by law. • The possibility of exporting products to the mainland (the non-FTZ areas) within the framework of the added value regime. • Sale or lease of the land for natural or legal Iranian persons and long-term leases for non-Iranians. • Suitable rates for energy consumption.28  C.  Regulatory Concessions  1.  Grants and Loans  Iran offers investment incentives and regulatory concessions to promote foreign investment. FIPPA provides a legal framework that prescribes equal benefits and privileges for foreign investors and protection against discriminatory treatment. Tax incentives, including reduced rates, exemptions, or credits, are outlined in the Direct Taxes Act and other tax regulations. Land allocation at discounted rates or through grants is facilitated by government policies. Special economic zones (SEZs), such as the Kish Free Zone, Qeshm Free Zone, and Chabahar Free Trade-Industrial Zone, each have their own set of laws governing specific incentives and concessions. The Law on Public-Private Partnerships defines the rights, obligations, and incentives for public-private partnerships, while sector-specific incentives exist for priority industries, such as manufacturing, mining, tourism, agriculture, and technology.  2.  Tax Holidays  In Iran, tax holidays are available for various sectors and activities, providing exemptions from income and corporate taxes for specified durations. For industry, mining, and services, including hospitals and hotels, the tax holiday duration is five years. If these activities are located in industrial parks or special economic zones, the exemption period extends to seven years. In less- developed areas, the tax holiday can be as long as 10 years, and if these areas are located within industrial parks or special economic zones, the exemption period is extended to 13 years. In free-trade zones, all economic activities enjoy a tax holiday for 20 years. Income derived from agricultural activities is perpetually exempt from income tax at a rate of 100%. Additionally, 100% of income derived from the export of services, non-oil goods, and agricultural products, as well as 20% of income derived from the export of nonprocessed goods, is also exempt from income tax. Companies with more than 50 employees can benefit from an additional one-year exemption if they increase their employment volume by 50% compared to the previous year. Foreign companies with reliable brands can enjoy a reduced tax rate of 12.5% (instead of the standard 25%) on income derived from sales of products if they produce goods using the production capacity of Iranian companies and export at least 20% of the total production.29    28 Tax Incentives, supra note 19; Emrooz, supra note 7. 29 Tax Incentives, supra note 19. \fInvestment Incentives: Iran The Law Library of Congress 105 3.  Subsidies  Iranian law includes provisions on incentivizing and subsidizing investments, including in infrastructure, by offering subsidized interest rates on loans taken for development projects and reducing the cost of borrowing;30 providing tax credits or exemptions to businesses or individuals, especially for investing in religious projects; and public-private partnerships for developmental projects, with subsidies or guarantees to attract private investments.31  V.  Tax Treaties  To facilitate business collaboration between Iranian and foreign nationals and to boost trade and economic exchanges with foreign countries, the Iranian government has signed mutual agreements to avoid double taxation. These consist of bilateral investment treaties (BITs) with 70 countries and treaties on avoidance of dual taxation concluded with 42 countries.32  30 International Monetary Fund, Targeted Subsidy Reform in Iran (Mar. 18, 2014) https://perma.cc/AP7N-M5AC; Targeted Subsidies Reform Act, socialprotection.org (May 2, 2018), https://perma.cc/38FR-BVR7.  31 Direct Taxes Act arts. 132–149. 32 Iran at a Glance, supra note 7. \fThe Law Library of Congress 106 Israel Ruth Levush Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Israeli law provides a variety of benefits in the form of grants and tax incentives to investors for approved projects that contribute to the development of Israel’s production capacity, to the improvement of the business sector’s ability to cope with competitive conditions in international markets, and to the creation of infrastructure for new and sustainable jobs.    Capital investments in agriculture may qualify for grants and for special tax benefits such as accelerated depreciation deductions and reduced corporate and dividend tax. Capital-intensive companies may enjoy reduced tax rates on qualifying income from qualifying activities or from realizing a qualifying investment, as well as on dividend income derived from qualifying investments. Capital gain from the sale of a share in a capital-intensive foreign resident company will be exempt from tax if the seller was a foreign resident at the time of purchasing the share; if the share was inherited, the exemption will apply if the testator was a foreign resident at the time of the purchase of the share.    Israel has one free trade zone, the Red Sea port city of Eilat. Business conducted in the free trade zone may entitle employers to reduced employers’ tax and enjoyment of taxation benefits such as tax exemptions and tax credits.   In accordance with the bilateral tax treaty between Israel and the United States, Israeli residents may be exempt from US tax on gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of capital assets under conditions enumerated in the treaty. Incentives for Israeli investors seeking to invest abroad have not been identified.   I.  Introduction  Israel imposes progressive income tax requirements on the taxable income of individuals as well as companies. These rates apply to income received by individual taxpayers at the yearly rates of 31% for any income exceeding 238,800 Israeli Shekel (ILS) (about US$64,476), 35% from ILS238,801 to ILS496,920 NIS (about US$134,168), and 47% for any additional amount. Reduced rates apply to individuals at the age of 60 years or older under specified conditions.1   The rate on income that has been derived by a group of persons is generally subject to a corporate tax at the rate of 23%.2 The tax rate on capital income received by an individual is 25%. Income  1 Income Tax Ordinance § 121(a), Dine Medinat Yisrael No. 6 p. 120, as amended; up-to-date version at the Nevo Legal Database (in Hebrew, by subscription), https://perma.cc/Q8QD-4LLG. 2 Id. §§ 91(a), 126(a). \fInvestment Incentives: Israel The Law Library of Congress 107 deriving from dividends and from capital gains is subject to income tax at the rate of 25%, or 30% for substantial shareholders as defined by the law.3  Investors may, however, enjoy extensive benefits in the form of grants and reduced tax rates under legislation designed to encourage capital investments in specific sectors.4 Capital investments may qualify for such benefits when they are in tourism, biotechnology and nanotechnology enterprises,5 agriculture,6 or ventures undertaken by capital-intensive companies,7 as described below.   II.  Tax Incentives and Grants for Innovation and Activity in Developing Areas  A. Objectives  The Capital Investments Law states that its objectives are to encourage  . . . capital investment and economic initiative, . . . to prioritize innovation and activity in [government designated] development areas, for . . .  (1) Development of the production capacity of the state economy;  (2) Improving the ability of the business sector to compete in . . . international markets;  (3) Creating infrastructure for new and sustainable workplaces.8  In order to meet these objectives, the law authorizes the provision of grants, exemptions, discounts, concessions, and permits, whether generally or on the basis of a plan for one or several of the following:  •   the construction or expansion of a factory or part of a factory, •  the construction, expansion or acquisition of property that is a “rental building” or an   “institutional rental building,” as defined by the law, and • investment by an industrial enterprise in areas specified by the law based on their low socio-economic status, according to tracks determined by the ministers of the treasury with the ministry of economy and industry or with the minister of tourism, as relevant.9  3 Id. § 91(b). 4 Invest in Israel, Israel Ministry of Econ. & Indus., https://perma.cc/6BAF-Q7Q9. 5 Encouragement of Capital Investments Law, 5719-1959, SH 5719 No. 293 p. 234, as amended; updated full text at the Nevo Legal Database, https://perma.cc/RM4Q-DP35 (in Hebrew, by subscription). 6 Encouragement of Capital Investments in Agriculture Law, 5741-1980, as amended, SH 5741 No. 996 p. 56, up-to-date version at the Nevo Legal Database (in Hebrew, by subscription), https://perma.cc/3E8S-F5LR. 7 Encouragement of Investments (Capital-Intensive Companies) Law, 5750-1990, SH 5719 No. 1324 p. 170, available at Nevo Legal Database, https://perma.cc/F56W-UX8P (in Hebrew, by subscription). 8 Id. § 1. 9 Id. § 3. \fInvestment Incentives: Israel The Law Library of Congress 108 B. Implementing Agencies  The Investment and Development of Industry and Economy Administration was established under the law to implement its objectives,10 as was the Tourism Investment Administration.11 Both administrative bodies may, among other actions,  (1) initiate and organize activities to encourage capital investment in Israel;  (2) give approval to the plans . . . ;  (3) maintain contact between investors and government ministries and other relevant authorities, to provide information on capital investments in Israel and to disseminate them, and to assist investors in realizing their plans;  (4) recommend to any competent authority that it shall grant within the scope of the legislations within its jurisdiction or which it is in charge of executing, an exemption, discount, easement or license to an enterprise, property, investment or loan which may assist in achieving the purpose of this Act . . . .12   The administration bodies may, at their discretion and within their yearly appropriated budget, approve a plan or part of a plan with respect to industrial enterprises or tourism lodging facilities, as relevant.13 To qualify, the industrial enterprise must be one whose main activity is in the field of biotechnology or nanotechnology, as confirmed by the National Authority for Technological Innovation; or one in which yearly income from the sales of the enterprise in a particular market does not exceed 75% of its total income in that tax year. An industrial enterprise may also qualify if 25% or more of its total income in the tax year derives from the sales of the enterprise in a particular market with at least 14 million residents.14   Plans for tourism lodging facilities may be approved if they contribute to the economic independence of the state economy and constitute a competitive enterprise that contributes to the gross domestic product. To be considered, at least 25% of all overnight stays in the facility in each tax year, or according to the calculation of the average in the tax year and in the two preceding tax years, are overnight stays by nonresidents.15   C.  Grants  The law authorizes the provision of an investment grant to qualified corporations and partnerships that own an enterprise that is an industrial enterprise, equipment rental factory, industrial building or renovated industrial building, or an approved tourist enterprise. The law  10 Id. § 5. 11 Id. § 16(a-f). 12 Id. § 10. 13 Id. § 18(a). 14 Id. § 18A(c)(1-2). 15 Id. § 18A(b), (c)(3). \fInvestment Incentives: Israel The Law Library of Congress 109 specifies the conditions and the rates of investment grants that may be awarded to qualified enterprises.16  D.  Tax Benefits  1. Tax Benefits for Approved Tourist Enterprises  Approved tourist enterprises of lodging and attractions may enjoy accelerated depreciation for machinery, equipment, and buildings, a deduction of depreciation in case of unusual wear and tear, and an exemption from income tax for land development grants.17   A taxable income from an approved investment received by an individual is taxed at a rate not exceeding 25% of that income. Taxable income received by a company that derived from an approved investment is similarly capped at the 25% rate and is exempt from any other tax on it.18  The law provides variable reduced rates of corporate tax for income deriving from an approved enterprise, depending on the date of approval of the enterprise and the percentage of foreign investment made.19 A foreign resident who receives a dividend in foreign currency paid from a company’ s taxable income, after deducting the applicable corporate tax, will be exempt from any tax.20  2. Tax Benefits for Preferred Enterprises   A preferred company enjoys a lower corporate tax on its preferred income of 7.5% or 16%, depending on whether it is located in an area determined as preferred development area or is operating a “special preferred technological enterprise” as defined by the law, as compared with a 23% corporate tax rate that would otherwise apply under the Income Tax Ordinance.21 Such a company may also enjoy an accelerated depreciation for production assets used to generate the income.22 Dividends deriving from preferred taxable income are similarly subject to a lower rate of 20% as compared with 25% to 30% rate under the ordinance. 23 The law provides detailed definitions of what constitutes preferred status for the purpose of eligibility for tax benefits.   Reduced corporate, dividend, and capital tax may further apply to special preferred technological income that derives from research and development of technological products in Israel. The tax rate on capital gains of a preferred company with a preferred technological enterprise in the sale  16 Id. § 40B. 17 Id. §§ 41-47. 18 Id. § 46. 19 Id. § 47. 20 Id. § 48. 21 Id. § 51 P; Income Tax Ordinance, § 126(a), Dine Medinat Yisrael No. 6 p. 120, as amended; up-to-date version at the Nevo Legal Database (in Hebrew, by subscription), https://perma.cc/Q8QD-4LLG. 22 Encouragement of Capital Investments Law § 51. 23 Id.; Income Tax Ordinance § 125B. \fInvestment Incentives: Israel The Law Library of Congress 110 of a beneficiary intangible asset to a foreign resident related company is also reduced to 12%, provided that the asset was purchased from a foreign resident company at a price of ILS200 million or more (about US$53.82 million); or 6%, provided that either the company is the first owner of the property or it purchased the property from a foreign resident company. For the purpose of the reduced rates the law defines ”capital gains“ as “capital gains deriving from research and development in Israel, all in accordance with instructions to be determined by the Minister of Finance, with the approval of the Knesset Finance Committee, which meet international standards regarding the tax regime.”24  III.  Tax Benefits and Grants for Capital Investments in Agriculture  The Encouragement of Capital Investments in Agriculture Law, 5741-1980, established the Agency for Investments in Agriculture.25 The law authorizes the agency to approve the provision of “grants, exemptions, discounts and concessions” for agricultural projects that contribute to implementation of the following objectives:  (1) Improving the State’s balance of payments by developing agricultural exports and developing clear import substitutes as determined by the Minister of Finance and the Minister of Agriculture with the approval of the Knesset Finance Committee;  (2) Efficient utilization of natural conditions, economic ability, technical knowledge and professional experience inherent in the agricultural sector, to the extent that is beneficial to the state economy;  (3)  Encouraging the agricultural sector as a pioneering, security and social factor.26  Depending on the location of the enterprise, grants may be given at the rates of 10% or 20% of the original price of an approved agricultural enterprise, excluding expenses for the purchase of land.27  Approved projects may enjoy special tax benefits such as accelerated depreciation deductions.28 Taxable income obtained by a company that owns an approved agricultural enterprise is subject to a corporate tax at a rate not exceeding 25% of that income, and it is exempt from any other tax. A dividend received by an individual from a taxable income after the deduction of the corporate rate is taxed at a reduced rate of 20%.29    24 Encouragement of Capital Investments Law § 51z. 25 Encouragement of Capital Investments in Agriculture Law, 5741-1980, as amended, §§ 5-16, SH 5741 No. 996 p. 56, up-to-date version at the Nevo Legal Database (in Hebrew, by subscription), https://perma.cc/3E8S-F5LR. 26 Id. §§ 1-2. 27 Id. §§ 23-29. 28 Id. §§ 31-32. 29 Id. § 33; Encouragement of Capital Investments Law § 47(b)(2). \fInvestment Incentives: Israel The Law Library of Congress 111 A company that is eligible to receive a grant due to a factory it owns may choose an “alternative benefits track” and be exempt from tax on its taxable income obtained from an approved enterprise for a period of five years from the beginning of the benefits period. Such an exemption will apply in lieu of all other tax benefits to which it is entitled and in lieu of all the grants to which it is entitled, provided that the company has requested it in writing at the time of submitting the application for approval of the enterprise.30  IV.  Tax Incentives for Investments by Capital-Intensive Companies   A capital-intensive company and its shareholders may qualify for benefits under the Encouragement of Investments (Capital Intensive Companies) Law, 5750-1990.31 The law defines a “capital intensive company“ as a company in respect of which all of the following have been fulfilled:  (a) its outstanding share capital is at least $30 million of the United States of America, at least 75% of which is used in qualifying activities or invested in qualifying investments;  (b) in the Company’s founding documents, and in the prospectus or prospectus or other similar document approved by a competent authority and in which shares of the company were offered to the public, it is stated that only non-residents may purchase shares in the Company;  (c) its objectives are to engage in qualifying activities in Israel or to invest in Israeli resident companies whose main activity is qualifying activities;  (d) the company has been approved as a capital-intensive company . . . [by December 31, 1992 by the minister of the treasury under terms as determined by the minister].32  The law considers the income of a capital-intensive company from the sale of shares allocated to it as part of a qualifying investment as a capital gain.33 A qualifying investment applies to the establishment or expansion of factories in Israel as well as research and development in the areas of industry, agriculture, tourism, transportation, construction, water, energy, physical infrastructure for the transfer of information, or computerization.34 The tax rate that a capital-intensive company will owe on its qualifying income from qualifying activities or from realizing a qualifying investment will not exceed 25%, and for dividend income derived from qualifying investment will not exceed 15%.35   30 Encouragement of Capital Investments in Agriculture Law § 35A(a). 31 Encouragement of Investments (Capital Intensive Companies) Law, 5750-1990, SH 5750 No. 1324 p. 170, available at the Nevo Legal Database, https://perma.cc/LR9W-ER5E (in Hebrew, by subscription).  32 Id. §§ 1-2. 33 Id. § 4(a).  34 Id. § 1(3). 35 Id. §§ 4, 5(a). \fInvestment Incentives: Israel The Law Library of Congress 112 Capital gain from the sale of a share in a capital-intensive foreign resident company will be exempt from tax if the seller was a foreign resident at the time of the purchase of the share; if the share was inherited, the exemption will apply if the testator was a foreign resident at the time of the purchase of the share.36  The law authorizes the minister of Finance, with the approval of the Knesset Finance Committee, to determine additional types of activities and investments that will be deemed to be qualifying activities and investments, generally either with respect to types of companies or with respect to a particular company.37  V.  Free Trade Zones   Israel has one free trade zone, the Red Sea port city of Eilat.38 In accordance with the Eilat Free Trade Zone Law (Tax Exemptions and Rebates), 5745-1985, transactions between dealers outside Eilat and dealers inside Eilat are exempt from value-added tax. 39 The law further exempts an employer who is a resident of the city of Eilat from employers’ tax, which applies to the income paid for work performed within the city of Eilat.40  The law further provides a credit at the rate of 10% of the personal earned income for an individual taxpayer who has been a resident of Eilat during the entire tax year, up to the sum of ILS227,640 (about US$62,419), for income which was accumulated or produced in the Eilat area.41 An employer resident of the city of Eilat who pays an employee income for work performed within the city of Eilat is entitled to a reduction in personal earned income taxes as prescribed by the law.42  VI.  Tax Treaties  According to a 2021 report by the US Department of State,   Israel has bilateral investment treaties in force with Japan, Myanmar, Ukraine, Azerbaijan, Guatemala, China, Ethiopia, Serbia, Montenegro, Uruguay, Mongolia, Thailand, Belarus, Romania, Croatia, El Salvador, Armenia, Slovakia, South Korea, Cyprus, Slovenia, Czech Republic, Moldova, Turkey, Argentina, Kazakhstan, Albania, Georgia, Turkmenistan, Uzbekistan, Bulgaria, Lithuania, Estonia, Latvia, and Poland.  36 Id. § 6. 37 Id. § 7. 38 2021 Investment Climate Statements: Israel, US State Dep’t, https://perma.cc/38HF-LDFM. 39 Eilat Free Trade Zone Law (Tax Exemptions and Rebates), 5745-1985, § 5, SH 5745 No. 1156 p. 204, as amended, up-to-date version at Nevo Legal Database, https://perma.cc/G6E5-CC3H (in Hebrew, by subscription). 40 Id. § 10.  41 Id. § 11. 42 Id. § 12. \fInvestment Incentives: Israel The Law Library of Congress 113 Israel has signed bilateral investment treaties with the United Arab Emirates, South Africa, and Germany that are not yet in force.

The United States and Israel signed a free trade agreement in 1985.  Israel has a bilateral tax treaty with United States. Israel signed its Income Tax Treaty with the United States in 1975.43  In accordance with the bilateral tax treaty between Israel and the United States, a resident of either contracting state is exempt from tax by the other contracting state on gains from the sale, exchange, or other disposition of capital assets unless the gain is from income deriving from real property within the other contracting state, from royalties, from business profits, or “from industrial or commercial profits attributable to a permanent establishment which the resident has in such other Contracting State under conditions enumerated.”44  VII.  Investments Outside Israel  No special incentives or restrictions were identified for Israeli investors seeking to invest abroad. Investing outside of Israel may be restricted, however, “on national security grounds or in certain countries or sectors where the Israeli government deems such investment is not in the national interest.”45    43 US State Dep’t, supra note 38. 44 Convention Between the Government of the United States of America and the Government of the State of Israel with Respect to Taxes on Income, Nov. 20, 1975, 26 U.S.T. 1674, https://perma.cc/7PB9-D2KD. 45 US State Dep’t, supra note 38. \fThe Law Library of Congress 114 Japan Sayuri Umeda Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Capital gains from equity investments of individuals are taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315%. Capital gains from real estate transfers are also taxed separately from general income, but different rules apply. For corporations, capital gains from equity investment become a part of the general income, and general corporate tax rates apply.   Japan has an individual saving account system that exempts capital gains tax under certain conditions for certain periods. The system will be expanded starting in 2024.    I.  Overview   Major national tax revenue comes from income tax, corporate tax, and consumption tax in Japan. The resident tax is income and corporate taxes at prefectural and municipal levels. Real estate property tax is imposed at the municipal level.1 Both the national government and the local governments administer various taxes.  The national income tax rates are as follows:   Taxable income  Tax rates  Up to 1,950,000 yen (approx. US$13,485) 5% Over 1,950,000 yen Up to 3,300,000 yen (approx. US$22,821) 10% Over 3,300,000 yen Up to 6,950,000 yen (approx. US$48,063) 20% Over 6,950,000 yen Up to 9,000,000 yen (approx. US$62,240) 23% Over 9,000,000 yen Up to 18,000,000 yen (approx. US$124,479) 33% Over 18,000,000 yen Up to 40,000,000 yen (approx. US$276,620)  40% Over 40,000,000 yen  45%  Tax rates apply to each part of the total income. For example, if a person’s taxable income is 3,300,000 yen, the total income tax is 5% of 1,950,000 plus 10% of 1,350,000. 2     1 Japan Federation of Certified Public Tax Accountants’ Associations, Guide to Japanese Taxes, sec. 2 (2018), https://perma.cc/49DB-GECM.  2 Income Tax Act, Act No. 33 of 1965, as amended by Act No. 3 of 2023, art. 89, https://perma.cc/3XE2-7G3U (in Japanese). \fInvestment Incentives: Japan The Law Library of Congress 115 II.  Capital Gains Tax for Equity Investments by Individuals  Capital gains means income arising from a transfer of assets.3 The amount of capital gains is aggregated after deductions for necessary expenses.4 Instead of finding capital gains provisions within the Income Tax Act, the Act on Special Measures Concerning Taxation (Special Measures Act) applies to capital gains income arising from the transfer of securities. 5    Capital gains from sales of certain securities (including shares and equity interest in corporations and warrant bonds) are taxed separately from other sources of income at a flat rate of 20.315%: 15% under the Special Measures Act,6 0.315% under the Reconstruction Special Measures Act7 and 5% under the Local Tax Act. 8 Capital gains from listed shares and unlisted shares are separately calculated. Listed shares are shares listed on the Japanese or foreign stock exchanges and government bonds, among others. Unlisted shares are shares other than listed shares. Capital gains or losses arising from the sale of listed shares cannot be used to offset capital losses or gains arising from the sale of unlisted shares.9  Gains from foreign stock transfers are taxed in the same way as gains from domestic stock transfers. In many cases, gains on the sale of foreign stocks are not taxed in foreign countries under tax treaties.10 Japan has tax treaties with 81 countries.11 If there is no tax treaty with a specific country, the foreign tax credit applies to sales of foreign stocks. When a resident pays foreign income taxes, the amount of those foreign income taxes is allowed as a credit against Japan’s income taxes for the year.12  Capital gains from sales of real property are also separately taxed from general capital gains income under the Special Measures Act, but different rules apply.13 Gains on property that has been held for over five years as of January 1 of the year when the transfer is made are considered  3 Id. art. 33, para. 1, 4 Id. art. 33, para. 3. 5 Act on Special Measures Concerning Taxation (Special Measures Act), Act No. 26 of 1957, as amended by Act No. 3 of 2023, art. 37-10 through art. 38, https://perma.cc/2H4R-7792 (in Japanese).  6 Id. art. 31. 7 Act on Special Measures Concerning Securing Financial Resources Necessary to Implement Measures for Reconstruction from the Great East Japan Earthquake (Reconstruction Special Measures Act), act No. 117 of 2011, as amended by Act No. 3 of 2023, art. 13, https://perma.cc/84XA-NMUL (in Japanese).  8 Local Tax Act, Act No. 226 of 1950, as amended by Act No. 1 of 2023, art. 71-49, https://perma.cc/5HQU-2JHY (in Japanese).  9 Special Measures Act, arts. 37-10, 37-11. 10 Tax Answer No.1937 居住者が海外で株式等を売却した場合の課税関係等 (Taxation when a resident sells stock overseas), National Tax Agency (Apr. 1, 2022), https://perma.cc/5MFT-6AER.   11 The List of Japan's Tax Conventions, Ministry of Finance (July 14, 2023), https://perma.cc/63T2-QA25.  12 Income Tax Act, art. 95, para. 1.  13 Id. art. 31, para. 1. \fInvestment Incentives: Japan The Law Library of Congress 116 long-term capital gains.14 The tax rate is the same as the one that applies to capital gains income from securities transfers: 20.315%.15 Gains on property that is held for five years or less as of January 1 of the year when the transfer is made are classified as short-term capital gains and are taxed at a rate of 39.63%: 30% under the Special Measures Act,16 0.63% under the Reconstruction Special Measures Act,17 and 9% under the Local Tax Act.18 The Special Measures Act provides special deductions that apply in specified cases. For example, if an individual’s real estate is forcibly expropriated, the person may deduct 50 million yen (approx. US$345,850) from capital gains for the expropriation.19  III.  Capital Gains Tax for Equity Investments by Corporations   Capital gains from the sale of land and securities, among other assets, are subject to normal corporate income taxes in the same manner as ordinary business income.20 The corporate income tax rate is 23.20%.21 With other national and local taxes, the effective tax rate is 29.74%.22 When a Japanese corporation has income from foreign stock transactions and the foreign government taxes the income, it is allowed to claim credits for foreign corporation tax.23  IV.  Incentives for Security Investments by Individuals    A.  No Obligation to Report Side Income Up to 200,000 Yen (approx. US$1,383)   Though this is not specifically for capital gains from security investments, this rule applies. Most salary earners do not need to file a final tax return because the salary payers determine the actual amount of income tax at the end of the tax year and adjust it to reflect in employees’ salaries.24 However, some salary earners must file a final tax return if they are in specified situations. Two such situations are: persons whose annual salary income exceeds 20 million yen (approx. US$138,340); and persons who receive salary from one place and whose total amount of income  14 Id. 15 Id.  16 Id. art. 32. 17 Reconstruction Special Measures Act, art. 13. 18 個人住民税 [Individual Resident Tax], Bureau of Taxation, Tokyo Metropolitan Government, sec. 12, https://perma.cc/B8FJ-5BBA.  19 Special Measures Act, art. 33-4. 20 Corporate Tax Act, Act No. 28 of 1947, as amended by Act No. 47 of 2023, art. 22, para. 2, https://perma.cc/JP2U-VNCA (in Japanese).

NISA: Nippon (Japan) Individual Savings Account   NISA is a tax exemption program for small investments. NISA exempts dividends earned from investing in stocks and mutual funds, as well as gains from trading stocks, from income taxes. Currently, NISA’s enrollment period ends on December 31, 2023. 27  1.   Current NISA  a.  General NISA  A general NISA allows eligible persons to invest, through a licensed financial instruments business operator, up to 1.2 million yen (approx. US$8,300) a year tax-free for capital gains and dividends for five years. The total investment permitted is up to 6 million yen (approx. US$41,502). Eligible investments are stocks and mutual funds. Eligible persons are residents and non-residents with permanent establishment (PE) who are at least 18 years old as of January 1 of the year when the account is opened.28  b. Tsumitate (Periodic Contribution) NISA  This is also for residents and non-residents with PE who are 18 years or older as of January 1 of the year when the account is opened. Eligible persons can invest up to 400,000 yen (approx. US$2,767) a year through a licensed financial instruments business operator and are granted a tax-free period of 20 years on the investment. The total investment limit is 8 million yen (approx. US$55,336). Eligible investments are mutual funds suitable for long-term investment.29  An eligible person can only have either a general NISA account or a tsumitate NISA account though they can switch from one to the other yearly.30    25 Income Tax Act, art. 121. 26 株の初心者必見！株式投資で利益をあげたときの税金は所得税と住民税 (Stock Trading Beginner Must Read!

Junior NISA  A junior NISA is similar to a general NISA. Eligible persons are those who have not yet reached the age to be eligible for a general NISA. The investment limit is 800,000 yen (approx. US$5,534) a year. The tax-free period is five years. Eligible investments are stocks and mutual funds.31   The major difference between a junior NISA and a general NISA is the restriction on withdrawals. The invested money can be moved to a junior NISA holder’s savings account via the same financial instruments business operator. The money moved to the savings account can be reinvested in a NISA, but cannot be withdrawn. If a junior NISA accountholder withdraws money from the saving account, any profits are taxed.32   2.  New NISA (2024-)  The new NISA will expand the current system and eliminate the time limit for the tax-exempt period. New NISA accounts will include both general NISA and tsumitate NISA type investments. They will be renamed “growth quota” and “tsumitate quota.” The annual investment limit will be expanded: 2.4 million yen (approx. US$16,601) per year for growth quota and 1.2 million yen (approx.

While dividends paid to non-residents are taxed at a 15% rate, residents and nonresidents who are citizens of East African Community Partner states pay 5%. Dividends paid to nonresidents by special economic zone enterprises are exempt from taxes. Export processing zone enterprises are accorded a 10-year corporate tax holiday and payments, including dividends, that such enterprises make to nonresidents within this period are tax exempt.       I.  Introduction  The Constitution accords the national government the authority to impose income tax, value added tax, customs duties and other duties on import and export goods, excise tax, and any other tax or duty authorized by an act of Parliament.1 County governments may impose property rates, entertainment taxes, and any tother tax authorized to impose by an act of Parliament.2   In addition to the Constitution, various tax laws and tax administration laws that the national government administers anchor the tax legal and regulatory regime. These include: the Public Finance Act of 2012, the Income Tax Act of 1973, the Value Added Tax Act of 2013, the Excise Duty Act of 2015, the Tax Procedures Act of 2015, the East African Community Customs Management Act of 2004, the Miscellaneous Fees and Levies Act of 2016, the Tax Appeals Tribunal Act of 2013, and the Kenya Revenue Authority Act of 1995.3  There are different categories of taxes: direct taxes (taxes on income), indirect taxes (taxes on consumption), and customs duties (taxes on import and export).4    Income tax is an annual tax collected from income of a person accrued or derived in Kenya regardless of whether the person is a resident of Kenya.5 In this context, the following are considered income:     1 Constitution of Kenya, 2010, § 209, https://perma.cc/7932-RR86.  2 Id.  3 National Treasury and Planning, National Tax Policy 7 (2022), https://perma.cc/8VCC-FKBJ.  4 Id. at 10.  5 Income Tax Act No. 16 of 1973, § 3 (Jan. 1, 1974), https://perma.cc/E63V-KACX.  \fInvestment Incentives: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 120 • gains or profits from any business, any employment or services rendered, or rental income; • dividends or interest; • pension income; • income from internet-based business, including a digital marketplace;  • income from natural resources;  • leases;  • capital gains; or  • income deemed relevant.6  Income is classified into two broad categories: individual income and corporate income. While personal income tax is collected on “wages, salaries, dividends, interest, and other income earned by a person in gainful employment,” companies (including those registered outside of Kenya but that operate there), trusts, and co-operatives pay corporate income tax.7  II.

Capital Gains  Capital gains tax applies to gains that arise from the sale of property located in Kenya. The law provides that this tax be charged at a 15% rate of the net gains minus the cost of acquisition and other costs.13   Some expenses can be deducted. Allowable expenses include: mortgage interest payments, cost of marketing the property, appraisal costs, legal fees and improvement costs.14 In addition, the following are exempt from capital gains tax:  • Income that is taxed elsewhere as in the case of property dealers • Issuance by a company of its own shares and debentures • Transfer of property for the purpose only of securing a debt or a loan • Transfer by a creditor for the purpose only of returning property used as security for a debt or a loan • Transfer by a personal representative of any property to a person as beneficiary in the course of the administration of the estate of a deceased person. • Transfer of assets between spouses; • Transfer of assets between former spouses as part of a divorce settlement or a bona fide separation agreement; • Transfer of assets to immediate family; • To a company where spouses or a spouse and immediate family hold 100% shareholding; • A private residence if the individual owner has occupied the residence continuously for the three-year period immediately prior to the transfer concerned.15  If a firm, having been certified to do so by the Nairobi International Financial Centre Authority, invests K Sh. five billion (about USD $ 35,410,764) and transfers the investment after five years, the applicable rate is the one that prevailed at the time the investment was made.16  C.

A preferential tax rate of 10% is applicable on capital gains obtained from the sale of certain securities, including shares issued by Mexican or foreign entities in Mexico’s stock exchange and those issued by Mexican companies in stock exchanges or derivatives markets located in a foreign country with which Mexico has a tax treaty to avoid double taxation. There are a number of investment incentives available in Mexico, including Special Economic Zones and a Manufacturing and Export Services Industries Program, which is a foreign trade facilitation instrument through which authorized companies are exempted from paying import duties and preferential fixed customs processing fees.   I.  Introduction  Mexico’s Income Tax Law provides that legal entities and individuals are required to pay income tax on all their income, including income received in cash, in kind, in services and in credit, regardless of the location of its source.1 Accordingly, capital gains obtained by legal entities and individuals are subject to income tax.2 The term “legal entities” includes corporations, limited liability companies, partnerships, banking companies, associations, and joint ventures.3  With respect to income obtained and taxed abroad, Mexico uses a credit method to address international double taxation.4 Specifically, Mexico’s Income Tax Law provides that Mexican corporations and individuals may get a credit for Mexican income tax purposes for income tax paid abroad in connection with foreign source income.5  The tax credit is available if the full amount of income from a non-Mexican source is considered taxable in Mexico.6 Furthermore, and as a general rule, the credit is applicable to foreign income  1 Ley del Impuesto sobre la Renta, as amended, arts. 1-I, 16, 90, Diario Oficial de la Federación [D.O.], Dec. 11, 2013, https://perma.cc/2BPZ-DZSK. 2 Id. arts. 16, 129.

Taxpayers who carry out share sales through intermediation contracts with nonresident financial institutions must calculate the gains and the corresponding tax and keep records with such information.12  IV.  Other Incentives  There are a number of investment incentives options available in Mexico, the most salient of which are summarized below.  A.  Special Economic Zones (SEZ)  Mexico’s Federal Law on Special Economic Zones governs the establishment and operation of such zones, which are defined as designated geographic areas in which the Mexican government makes available certain incentives in order to promote business activities, attract investments, and generate employment opportunities in underdeveloped regions of the country.13  Specific incentives are determined by presidential order and individualized to the particular project established in a SEZ, depending on the level of development that the government aims to achieve in that zone. They may include the following:  • Temporary exemption from or reduction of income tax. • 0% rate of value-added tax when acquiring goods for use in the SEZ. • 0% rate of value-added tax on services rendered to investors. • Treatment of goods imported to Mexico as non-imports when they are intended for exclusive use in the SEZs.14  B.  IMMEX Program   IMMEX is the Spanish acronym for the Manufacturing, Maquila and Export Services Industries Program, which is a foreign-trade facilitation instrument created by the Mexican government that allows authorized companies to import raw materials, machinery, and equipment into Mexico temporarily for use in the production of final products destined for export.15 The main benefits of  12 Ley del Impuesto sobre la Renta art. 129.

Incentives for Investments in Movie and Theater Production and High-Performance Sports Infrastructure  A legal commentator has summarized incentives for investments in movie and theater production and high-performance sports infrastructure as follows:  A tax credit is available for the amount assigned to investment projects for the film industry. The credit may be applied against the monthly income tax advance payments and the annual income tax due in the tax year in which such a tax credit originates. However, the tax credit may not exceed 10% of the income tax triggered in the immediate previous tax year.  . . . .  Companies are also entitled to a tax credit equal to the amount of the investments made in national theatre productions, i.e. investments made within Mexican territory in the staging of dramatic plays, the edition and publication of national literary works, visual arts, dance and music. This tax credit is subject to compliance with a number of requirements and may not exceed 10% of the corporate income tax generated in the year immediately preceding its application. This credit is not taxable income for income tax purposes.  . . . .  Taxpayers investing in infrastructure projects of high-performance sports, as well as in programs designed for the development, training and competition of Mexican high-performance athletes, may credit the contributions made to those projects against the annual income tax. The tax credit may not exceed 10% of the income tax triggered during the relevant tax year.17  16 Id.

Real estate investment funds are taxed corporate income tax. To promote competitiveness and investment, the government offers tax incentives for productive investments. A specific tax regime is available to entities licensed in the only free trade zone in the autonomous region of Madeira. Portugal has signed treaties with many countries to avoid double taxation and tax evasion.     I.  Introduction  Article 101 of the Portuguese Constitution states that the financial system must be structured by law in such a way as to guarantee the accumulation, deposit, and security of savings, as well as the application of the financial resources needed for economic and social development.1 Taxes are created by laws, which must lay down their applicability and rate, fiscal benefits, and the guarantees accorded to taxpayers.2 Only the central government and municipalities are authorized to create taxes in the country.3 Personal income tax, corporate income tax, and state tax (derrama estadual) affect income in Portugal.     II.  Individual Taxation  A. Capital Gains  Article 10(1)(b)(5) of the Código do Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Singulares, or CIRS (Personal Income Tax Code) defines capital gains, among other things, as gains obtained which, not being considered business and professional income, capital or real estate, result from the sale (alienação onerosa) of shareholdings and other securities, including the redemption of units in investment funds and the liquidation of these funds.4 Gains are deemed to have been obtained at the time of carrying out the acts provided for in article 10(1).5 Gains subject to individual income tax are comprised of the difference between the realization value and the acquisition value.6  1 Constituição da República Portuguesa, VII Revisão Constitucional (2005), art. 101, https://perma.cc/D7DB-KUMC. 2 Id. art. 103(2). 3 Id. arts. 165(1)(i), 254. 4 Código do Imposto sobre o Rendimento das Pessoas Singulares [CIRS], Decreto-Lei 442-A/88, de 30 de Novembro, as amended by Lei No. 21/2023, de 25 de Maio, art. 10(1)(b)(5), https://perma.cc/XT34-DDHD.  5 Id. art. 10(3). 6 Id. art. 10(4)(a). \fInvestment Incentives: Portugal  The Law Library of Congress 129 According to article 72(1)(c) of the CIRS, the positive balance between capital gains and capital losses, resulting from the operations provided for in article 10(1), (b), (c), (e), (f), (g), (h), and (k) are taxed at an autonomous rate of 28%.7  The positive balance between capital gains and capital losses, resulting from the transactions provided for in article 10(1)(b)(4) and (5) of the CIRS, is taxed at an autonomous rate of 35% when the balance relates to securities issued by a non-resident entity without a permanent establishment in Portuguese territory, which is domiciled in a country, territory, or region subject to a clearly more favorable tax regime, and included in the list approved by decree of the member of the government responsible for the area of finance.8  Article 81(1) of the CIRS states that holders of income of different categories obtained abroad, including those provided for in article 72 of the CIRS, are entitled to a tax credit for international legal double taxation, deductible up to the limit of applicable special rates and, in cases of aggregation, up to the concurrence of the part of the collection proportional to these net incomes, considered under the terms of article 22(6), which corresponds to the smallest of the following amounts:  a) income tax paid abroad;   b) the fraction of the collection of the personal income tax, calculated before the deduction, corresponding to the income that may be taxed in the country in question, net of the specific deductions provided for in the CIRS.9   When there is an agreement to eliminate double taxation entered into by Portugal, the deduction to be made under the terms of article 81(1) of the CIRS cannot exceed the tax paid abroad under the terms provided for by the agreement.10  B. Income Tax  Article 2 of the CIRS defines income category A for tax purposes. It is considered income from dependent work with all remuneration paid or made available to its holder from   a) work on behalf of others provided under an individual employment contract or another legally equivalent contract;   b) work provided under a contract for the acquisition of services or something of an identical nature, under the authority and direction of the person or entity occupying the position of active subject in the resulting legal relationship;   c) exercising a public function, service, or position;   d) situations of pre-retirement (pré-reforma, pré-aposentação) or reserve, with or without work, as well as benefits granted, no matter what title, before verifying the  7 Id. art. 72(1)(c). 8 Id. art. 72(18)(b). 9 Id. art. 81(1). 10 Id. art. 81(2). \fInvestment Incentives: Portugal  The Law Library of Congress 130 requirements demanded in the mandatory social security regimes applicable for the transition to retirement, or, even if the employment contract does not last, benefits subject to the condition that they are due until such requirements are met, even if, in any of the cases previously provided for, they are due by pension funds or other entities, to replace the original debtor entity.11   The remuneration mentioned above includes, namely: wages, salaries, bonuses, percentages, commissions, participations, subsidies or bonuses, attendance fees, emoluments, participation in fines and other accessory remuneration, even if periodic, fixed or variable, of a contractual nature or not.12  Income is considered to be obtained in Portuguese territory, in cases when, among other things, the income is from dependent work arising from activities carried out therein, or when such income is owed by entities that have residence, headquarters, effective management, or permanent establishment therein.13  Article 68 defines the income tax rates as follows:   Taxable income in euros (€)                   Rates            Normal (A)  Average (B) Up to 7,479 (approx.

Incentives  According to the Portuguese Incentive Portal, within the scope of their activity, and with a view to promoting competitiveness and investment, companies can benefit from tax incentives for productive investment. These tax benefit regimes, characterized in general by the reduction or exemption from the payment of taxes, as well as by the reduction of corporate income tax, were reinforced, in particular with regard to investments that provide creation or maintenance of jobs and are located in less favored regions.41   A. Foreign Direct Investment  Decree-Law No. 162 of October 31, 201442 updated the Código Fiscal do Investimento or CFI (Investment Tax Code) and revised investment tax regimes, bringing together the most relevant tax instruments in terms of investment support and promotion. The benefit package provided for in this law comprises the contractual tax benefits regime for productive investment; investment support tax regime; tax incentives system for research and business development II; and the deduction regime for retained and reinvested profits (discontinued in 2022).43  1. Contractual Tax Benefits Regime for Productive Investment  Article 2(1) of the CFI, which provides for the contractual tax benefits regime for productive investment (regime de benefícios fiscais contratuais ao investimento produtivo), determines that until December 31, 2027, tax benefits may be granted, under a contractual regime, with a period of validity of up to 10 years from the completion of the investment project, to investment projects, as characterized in Chapter II of the Annex of the CFI, whose relevant investments are equal to or greater than €3 million (approx. US$3.3 million).44   According to article 2(2), the investment projects referred to in article 2(1) must have their object comprised, namely, in the following economic activities, respecting the sectoral scope of application of the guidelines on regional aid for the period 2022-2027:   a) Extractive industry and manufacturing industry;   b) Tourism, including activities of interest to tourism;   c) IT and related activities and services;   d) Agricultural, aquaculture, fish, farming and forestry activities;   e) Research and development and high technological intensity activities;    41 Incentivos Fiscais, Portal dos Incentivos, https://perma.cc/3U6A-QVJ7.

Rules for the application of tax benefits are determined by the federal government, the Ministry of Finance, and the Federal Tax Service. Most of the benefits allow for exemption from payment or lower rates for VAT and corporate profit tax and are applicable to officially registered participants of investment projects designated as such by federal or provincial governments. All benefits are granted for a specific period of time not exceeding 10 years. Eligibility for tax benefits often depends on the territory where the tax paying corporation is registered and the area of its business activity. Special taxation regimes are established for businesses operating in special economic zones, territories recognized as zones of advanced social and economic development, and clusters for research and innovative technologies. Other forms of benefits are investment tax credits, varied deductions for capital gain and interest earned through investing in bonds, deductions for calculating lower payments for land, and property, and use of mineral resources taxes. Russia has concluded agreements on avoidance of dual taxation with 65 foreign countries, and this appears to be the only incentive offered to Russian companies and individuals who invest in projects outside of the country. Scholars have assessed the Russian system of tax incentives as pinpointed to specific taxes and companies and have stated that current tax legislation does not encourage long-term investments.     I.  Introduction  General principles of taxation as well as their types, rates, rules for calculating the tax base, grounds for establishment and amendment of taxes, rights and obligations of the taxpayer, forms of taxation control, and responsibility for tax violations are defined by the Tax Code of the Russian Federation, a  comprehensive legal act, which serves as a governing law in the field of taxation.1 The Code provides for a three-tier proportional tax system consisting of 14 federal, three regional, and three local tax tiers.2 Federal taxes include the value added tax, excises, varied duties and mandatory insurance payments, individual income tax, corporate profit tax, and a set  1 Tax Code of the Russian Federation , adopted on July 16, 1998 (with additions and amendments), https://perma.cc/GNH5-3UNJ (in Russian). 2 Id. Chapter 2. \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 141 of taxes related to specific forms of business activity.3 Tax on the property of organizations and transportation tax are major regional taxes, while land tax and individual property tax are collected locally.4   Corporate profit tax and individual income tax are based on a flat rate basis and are taxed at 20% and 13% respectively. VAT is between 10-20% depending on the type of goods or services. While 20% is a standard VAT rate, the 10% tax rate applies to food, children’s goods, medicines, and medical equipment. In some cases, the VAT rate can be lowered to 0% as an investment incentive.  Rates for other taxes depend on the type of production, the business activity, and the nature of the business property.    The Ministry of Finance and the Federal Tax Service are the two major government institutions regulating the field of taxation.      Currently, Russian scholars assess the legal regime of tax incentives as underdeveloped and not systemic. In their opinion, this complicates the social and economic development of the country. They recommend a simplification of the process and the elimination of outdated requirements and taxpayers’ obligations.5    II.  Investment Legislation  According to Russian scholars, current investment legislation is “chaotic and not systemic” and is in need of reform.6 The main law in this field is the Law of 1999 on Capital Investments and Securities.7 The Law recognizes all “objects of civil rights as forms of investment, i.e., currency, securities, corporate assets, property, and property rights invested in objects of entrepreneurial or other activity with the purpose of gaining profit or other useful effect.”8 Investment activity is distinguished from ordinary investing, which can be a one-time action and be performed by lay persons. In addition to the Tax Code, special tax regimes providing for incentives and privileges to those who are involved in investment activities are also established by laws addressing specific areas of investment or particular investment instruments. These are, among others, the Law on Securities Market,9 the Law on Mortgages,10 the Law on Production Sharing Agreements,11 and  3 Tax Code, art. 13. 4 Id. arts. 14, 15.  5 Oksana Zhuravleva, Legal Regime of Tax Benefits, 1 Zhurnal Rossiiskogo Prava [Journal of Russian Law] 138 (2021), https://perma.cc/U6WW-GNAG (in Russian). 6 Oleg Gutnikov, Issues of the Development of Investment Legislation in the Russian Federation at the Present Stage, 1 Zhurnal Rossiiskogo Prava [Journal of Russian Law] 11 (2020), https://perma.cc/4XUD-CT9D (in Russian).   7  Federal Law No. 39 of Feb. 25, 1999 on Capital Investments, https://perma.cc/ST65-XKGY (in Russian). 8 Id. art. 1. 9 Federal Law No. 39 of Mar. 20, 1996 on Securities Market, https://perma.cc/RGR7-4JQ9 (in Russian).   10 Federal Law No. 152 of Nov. 11, 2003 on Mortgages, https://perma.cc/K2LE-NGHN (in Russian). 11  Federal Law No 225 of Dec. 30 1995 on Production Sharing Agreements, https://perma.cc/L29L-Q889 (in Russian).  \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 142 the Law on Personal Retirement Investments.12 All these laws provide for a specialized tax regime for investments in the field they are regulating. The related Tax Code amendments reflect tax privileges established by these laws.  Another category of investment legislation that provides a set of incentives is the laws aimed at attracting investments in particular territories. Most of the time, these are federal laws establishing special or free economic zones in Russian regions or laws of individual constituent components of the Russian Federation offering tax incentives to local businesses if they are involved in a specific investment activity regionally.13  Russian legislation provides for numerous tax incentives and privileges, which are not unified and differ by details of regulation. Existing tax preferences can be used by all investors regardless of the legal form of their business. The number of tax preferences is constantly increasing, which contributes to the complexity of the tax system; however, the preferences most often used are direct taxes, corporate profit tax, and property tax.14 Summarizing existing tax incentives for investment activities, Russian scholars recommend the following classification:  • Exemption of Investment Costs from Taxation: ✓ Exemption of specific goods and services from payment of VAT, ✓ Exemption from taxation of the reinvested part of profits, ✓ Exemption from taxation of businesses in Special Economic Zones. • Tax Deductions: ✓ Lower tax rates, ✓ Exemption from payment of specific taxes, ✓ Amortization premium. • Tax Credits: ✓ Postponement of tax payments, ✓ Investment tax credit, ✓ Tax holidays.15  These tax privileges are not used uniformly. Some of them are applicable to all categories of investors and others can only be used by investors involved in particular types of activities.      12 Federal Law No. 111 of Jul. 24, 2002 on Personal Retirement Investments, https://perma.cc/WW5Y-RGVP (in Russian).  13 See e.g., Federal Law No. 212 of Jul. 13, 2015 on Free Port of Vladivistok,  https://perma.cc/YR64-P3W7 (in Russian); Federal Law No. 473 of Dec. 29, 2014 on Territories of Advanced Social and Economic Development, https://perma.cc/X9GU-NY2V (in Russian). 14  Oksana Zhuravleva, supra note 5, at 134. 15 Nadezhda Semenova, Olga Arapova, Tax Incentives of Investment Processes in Russia: Current Practice and Development Prospects, 5 Financial Analytics: Science and Experience, 550–562 (2017), https://perma.cc/V35N-83KR (in Russian). \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 143 III.  Individual Incentives  A.  Corporate Property Tax Benefits  Corporate property tax benefits in the form of eliminating payment of this tax or lowering the tax rate to somewhere between 2-5% for a specific period of time depending on the business location are among the most popular and, reportedly, the share of this type of tax incentive is growing faster than all others.16 These incentives can be offered by federal and regional authorities. Most often they are used by investors under production sharing agreements in regard to property used for implementation of the agreement. Other tax payers eligible for investment tax benefits in relation to corporate property are  • organizations registered in special economic zones during a 10-year period from registration of their property in the special economic zone; • managing companies in special economic zones in regard to property created for the development of the SEZ within a 10-year period from registration of this property; • organizations in regard to buildings with high power efficiency within a three-year period from registration of this property; • the property of state owned research centers; and • organizations designated as official participants in specifically identified research and innovation centers.17  B.  VAT Exemptions  The following investors’ operations are exempt from VAT taxation:  • research and development work funded by federal appropriated funds; • research and development work related to the creation of new technologies or products based on new technologies; • residential construction for military personnel; • works aimed at the preservation or restoration of cultural or historic heritage; and • the provision of insurance services.18   Shares in the founding capital of a corporation, securities, and other financial instruments are exempt from paying VAT as well.19    16 Id. at 556. 17 Tax Code, arts. 372, 381, 385. 18 Id. art. 149. 19 Id.  \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 144 C.  Special Investment Contracts   The Federal Law on Industrial Policy in the Russian Federation, adopted in 2014, provides tax privileges for investments conducted under a special investment contract (SIC) concluded between the investor on one side and on the other side, jointly, the Russian Federation, a constituent entity of the Russian Federation, and a municipal entity if local legislation has been adopted. Under the contract, the investor agrees to invest in establishing a new production facility or upgrading existing production facilities to achieve a certain production volume with a specific level of localization. Investors may use their own or attracted funds to implement a manufacturing project aimed at introducing technology which would enable the creation of industrial products competitive at the global level.20 Food processing businesses are excluded from special investment contracts. The deadline for concluding a special investment contract is December 31, 2030. Contracts are concluded based on the results of an open or closed competitive selection process. Production must be conducted on Russian territory, on the continental shelf, or in the exclusive economic zone of the Russian Federation.21   In exchange for a commitment to produce competitive industrial products, an investor acquires tax preferences and other measures of state support.  In line with regional and local legislation, tax incentives for SIC include the reduction of corporate profit tax rate from 20% to 0% at the federal level and the part of the tax that goes to the regional budget can go down to 0%, depending on SIC conditions. Tax preferences may be in effect for a period of up to 10 years after the investor makes profit. The reduced tax rate applies from the tax period in which the first profit from the sale of goods produced within the framework of the SIC is received until the reporting period in which the organization’s status of a SIC participant is terminated. The amount of the tax benefit cannot exceed 50% of the volume of capital investments in the project as defined by SIC.22  Assurances of stability for given tax privileges depend on contracts’ content and time of their conclusion. Contracts concluded after September 2, 2019 are subject to a moratorium on tax increase or cancellation of lowered tax rates and other preferences.23    D.  Taxation of Investments in Securities   In 2015, Russian tax legislation was amended with new provisions to lower the tax base when making securities transactions. The goal is to make the purchase of securities more attractive in  20 Federal Law No. 488 of Dec. 16, 2014 on Industrial Policy in the Russian Federation, https://perma.cc/7R44-G4UU (in Russian). 21 Id. arts. 6, 18. 22 Tax Code, art. 284. 23 Oksana Zhuravleva, supra note 5, at 137. \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 145 the long term.24 These are investment tax deductions related to the opening of an individual investment account and investment tax relief in the form of long-term capital gains exemption.25  Capital gains in the amount of up to the equivalent to US$30,000 can be deducted from the amount of taxable income during the three-year period following the purchase of securities.     If an individual opens an investment account through a broker or financial advisor, an investor is eligible for one of two deductions: a return of 13% of the investment amount not exceeding the equivalent of approximately US$2,000 annually during the first three years of investment or a deduction of the amount of investments not exceeding the equivalent of US$2,000.26 The first option requires freezing of investment in specific securities for at least three years, while the second option freezes funds within an account. In this case, the way of investing is not restricted, and the investor can purchase cash, make bank deposits, or acquire derivative financial instruments.    A new concept of the investment tax deduction directly related to bonds emerged in 2015. It has been interpreted as the taxpayer’s right for reduction of the tax base on individual income tax in cases of transactions with securities and under certain conditions.27 Interest earned from federal government bonds, bonds of companies in the high technology sector, and some bonds issued by the Ministry of Finance is taxed at lower rates within limits established by the Central Bank of Russia annually. Bond interest is counted as a separate income and is taxed at the rate of 35%. Deductions depending on the length of owning may also apply.28   E.  Investment Tax Credits  Tax credits in the form of payment deadline extensions or phasing out the payment of taxes by lowering the amount of required payment for the corporate profit tax can be offered to a company involved in investment activities. Eligible companies are those that carry out research or development work, modernize their own technological processes, increase the number of workplaces for disabled individuals, improve energy efficiency, or protect the environment from industrial waste pollution.29      24 Olga Belomyttseva, Development of the System of Investment Tax Deduction in the Russian Federation for Stimulation of Investments in Securities, 2 Vestnik Tomskogo Universiteta.

Other Incentives  A.  Special Economic Zones  Companies registered as residents of special economic zones (SEZ) receive a number of tax preferences. SEZs are regulated by the Federal Law on Special Economic Zones of 2005.30 According to this law, special economic zones of four types can be created for 49 years. The law divides SEZs in the following categories:  • industrial production zones, • technical research and innovation development zones, • tourism and recreation zones, and  • ports and zones for port logistics.  There are currently 45 Special Economic Zones in Russia, of which 26 are industrial and production, seven are technical and innovative, 10 are tourist and recreational, and two are ports.31   The status of an SEZ resident may be obtained by a profit-making organization, except for a unitary enterprise. An individual entrepreneur registered in the territory of the municipal district where the respective SEZ is located can enter into an agreement on conducting activities in the SEZ with the managing entities. However, the work of individual entrepreneurs is allowed in technical research and innovation development, and tourism and recreation SEZs. A resident of the SEZ is entitled to engage only in the activities prescribed for the respective type of SEZ. In order to enter into an agreement with regional and local authorities, which may grant tax privileges, a resident investor must submit an application together with the business plan specifying a volume of investments to be made within a certain period, in an amount not less than provided for by the Federal Law on SEZs.32  Russian residents of SEZs are entitled to the following tax incentives: reduced corporate profit tax rates, tax holidays, and exemptions from certain taxes. Businesses are exempt from paying import and export customs duties and excise taxes with respect to the goods imported into the ports of SEZs. They may apply lower VAT rates with respect to the sale of goods placed under the free customs procedure, provided that certain requirements are met, and have full VAT exemption for port activities.33  Regional laws can establish lower rates for corporate profit tax and decrease them to 13.5% for the part that goes to regional budgets. For residents of technical research and innovation  30 Federal Law No.116 of Jul.8, 2005 on Special Economic Zones, https://perma.cc/Y297-LM2K (in Russian).  31 Russia Establishes Three New Special Economic Zones, Russia-Briefing.com (Oct. 19, 2022), https://perma.cc/3DUA-QVW6. 32 Federal Law on Special Economic Zones, arts. 2, 6, 9. 33 Id. art. 37; Tax Code, art. 149. \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 147 development and tourism and recreational zones, the rate may go down to 0%.34 The same 0% rate for the part of the tax that goes to the federal budget is established for residents of the Magadan (the most Eastern province of Russia) Special Economic Zone. For businesses operating in other special economic zones, the profit tax rate for the part that goes to the federal budget is 2%, compared to the regular 20%.35 A lower tax rate is foreseen for tax on the extraction of mineral resources.36 The Tax Code provides for full exemption of SEZ resident companies from paying property tax and land tax on land located within the special economic zones.37 Lower insurance rates and fees paid toward social purposes are established for individual entrepreneurs and businesses that pay salaries to employees and are located in technical research and innovation development and tourism and recreational SEZs.38  B.  Zones of Advanced Economic and Social Development  Zones for advanced economic and social development are parts of Russia’s constituent component’s territory designated by a federal government decision to have a special legal regime for business and other activities “in order to create favorable conditions for rising investments, socio-economic development and support of population.”39 These zones are created for 70 years with a possibility of extension.40  Residents of these zones are individual entrepreneurs or commercial organizations, except for the state and municipal enterprises, who entered into the agreement for performing activities in the zone for advanced economic and social development (“agreement for performing activities”) and are included in the zone’s resident registry. The management company is a joint stock company established by the federal government, where 100% of shares are owned by the Russian Federation. These companies are paying 0% profit tax for the federal part, and regions can establish lower rates for the parts of the tax that go to their budget. Lower rates on tax for using mineral resources and lower insurance fees are established for managing companies and residents.41   While zones for advanced economic and social development are regulated by the federal government, tax preferences for their residents are not established by the Tax Code but can be found in regional laws. For example, the Law of Ulyanovsk province of September 2, 2015 on Property Tax Paid by Organizations Registered in the Ulyanovsk Province, states that the rate for property tax is 0% for five years from the time a company is registered as a resident of the  34 Tax Code, art. 284. 35 Id.  36 Id. art. 342. 37 Id. arts. 381, 395. 38 Id. art. 427. 39 Federal Law No. 473 of Dec. 29, 2014 on Territories of Advanced Social and Economic Development, art. 2, https://perma.cc/X9GU-NY2V (in Russian). 40 Id. art. 3.  41 Advanced Special Economic Zones, About AZES, Forfumvostok.ru,  https://perma.cc/BEJ6-5XY8; Tax Code, arts. 284, 342, 427. \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 148 advanced economic and social development zone. As a rule, residents are exempt from paying land and property taxes.42        C.  Research and Innovative Technology Projects  Incentives are offered to organizations recognized as participants of formally designated projects on research or technological development.43 These could be research and high-tech companies as well as those organizations and individuals who ensure proper functioning of Innovative Science and Technology Centers.44 Tax incentives extend to the elimination of taxpayer obligations in regard to VAT, corporate profit tax, and property tax in regard to property recorded on the company’s balance sheet for ten years.45   In February 2023, the Ministry of Finance of Russia clarified the application of tax incentives in the form of reduced corporate income tax rates and social security contributions in the IT sector. If a company in the Russian IT industry earns at least 70% of its total revenue from specific IT activities, it can enjoy a corporate income tax rate of 0%, and a social security contribution rate of 7.6%. Companies can qualify for these benefits if they provide services using their own computer programs and databases, which are included in the unified register of Russian computer programs and databases.46  V.  Regional and Local Incentives  A.  Corporate Profit Tax Deductions  The investment tax deduction from corporate profit tax is applicable only to taxpayers located in regions that have adopted the relevant laws. The current corporate tax is set at 20%, with 17% transferred to the federal budget and 3% paid to the regional budget. Each region is allowed to establish its own reduced rate for the part of the corporate profit tax that goes to the regional budget. The maximum amount of the deduction is determined based on the amount of expenses specified in the Tax Code.47    42 Iulia Ledneva, Accounting of the Fiscal Interests of the State When Optimizing the Tax Regime for Attracting Investments, 7 Zhurnal Rossiiskogo Prava [Journal of Russian Law] 147 (2020), https://perma.cc/7KEP-D5JJ (in Russian).   43 Federal Law No. 216 of July 21, 2017 on Innovative Science and Technology Centers and on Amendments to Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation, https://perma.cc/CV8B-6HYB (in Russian).  44 Federal Law No. 244 of Sept. 21, 2010 on the Skolkovo Innovation Center, https://perma.cc/SG68-SBL5 (in Russian).  45 Tax Code, arts. 145, 246, 381. 46 Letter of the Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation No. 03-03-06/1/12385 of Feb. 14, 2023 on Application of the Reduced Corporate Income Tax Rate and Reduced Rates of Insurance Premiums Established for Organizations Operating in the Field of Information Technology, https://perma.cc/B24R-HXRX (in Russian). 47 Tax Code, art. 286.1.  \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 149  Investment tax deduction is offered by the Tax Code to all investors. However, it cannot be used by taxpayers participating in special investment contracts, research and development projects, organizations engaged in activities related to the extraction of hydrocarbons, and residents of special economic zones. These categories of taxpayers receive other specific tax preferences.48    B.  Incentives for Participants of Regional Investment Projects  Except for a few specific instances, incentives of this type are not supported by federal legislation but can have lower rates through regional and local laws. Usually, this is done in the form of providing lower rates for property tax or exemption from taxation of property acquired within the framework of regional investment projects.49   Constituent components of the Russian Federation can establish tax preferences and decrease rates in regard to regional taxes, including for taxes on business profits and individual income tax. The part of the business profit tax that goes to the regional budget can be decreased to 13.5% and a business can be exempt from paying property tax if the investor participates in specially designated regional projects aimed at reindustrializing the region or if the investor concluded a special investment agreement with the regional administration.50    As a rule, regional authorities offer a lowering of the tax rate depending on the amount of investments for a period of two to five years. The duration of tax benefits may also depend on the amount of investments. Some regions offer property tax deductions and exemptions depending on the type of goods produced by a business. Usually, these are enterprises involved in innovative work with new technologies, and areas of local significance, e.g., the production of glass and tires in the West Siberian province of Omsk.51   One of a few exceptions from this rule is the Federal Law on Amendments to the Tax Code of the Russian Federation in Part of Stimulating the Implementation of Regional Investment Projects in the Territories of the Far Eastern Federal District, adopted in 2013 and amended in 2022.52 The Law established qualifying criteria for tax benefit eligibility due to participation in regional investment projects. The requirements are: the production of goods specified by an agreement with regional authorities, capital investment in the amount of no less than Rubles 50 million  48 Iulia Ledneva, supra note 42, at 146.  49 Id. at 148. 50 Pavel Ershov, Regional System of Tax Benefits as the Basis of the Region’s Investment Attractiveness, 1 World of Economics and Management 21 (2018), https://perma.cc/TZ7T-F5AU (in Russian). 51 Id. at 25; Sergey Vasiliev, Olga Stepchenkova, Marina Vlasova, Investment Tax Incentives and Preferences of Enterprises in St. Petersburg, 4 Ekonomika I Upravlenie [Economy and Management Journal] (2016), https://perma.cc/BNL3-S4MP (in Russian). 52 Federal Law No. 267 of Sept. 20, 2013 on Amendments to Parts One and Two of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation in Part of Stimulating the Implementation of Regional Investment Projects in the Territories of the Far Eastern Federal District and Individual Constituent Components of the Russian Federation, https://perma.cc/5EN8-HUVD (in Russian).   \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 150 (approximately US$554,000) in a three-year period, or investment in the amount of Rubles 500 million (approximately US$5.5 million) in a five-year period.53   Companies meeting these requirements are eligible for a corporate profit tax rate reduction from 20% to 0% for the first five years after the resident starts making profit, and 10% for the next five years if they are working in one of the Siberian or Far East regions. In other regions, the reduced 10% profit tax rate applies starting from the year in which the resident makes profit until the year in which the total amount of received tax incentives equals the amount of capital investments. The effective rate of the mineral extraction tax is calculated with a lowering coefficient ranging from 0 to 0.8, depending on the period in which this coefficient is applied. In order to enjoy these tax benefits, more than 90% of revenue must be derived from Regional Investment Projects.54    More tax incentives for bigger capitals invested in regional investment projects, regardless of their territorial location, will be offered as of January 1, 2029.55  VI.  Tax Treaties and Protection of Foreign Investors  Foreign investors are allowed to conduct business in Russia as provided by a bilateral agreement on the protection of capital investments concluded between the Russian Federation and the investor’s country of origin or in some multilateral international treaties, such as the Treaty on Eurasian Economic Union concluded in 2014. The Treaty includes Protocol No. 16 on conducting investments. Article 70 of the Protocol states that each member state accepts the obligation to provide investors of other member states with treatment no less attractive than that offered to investors from a third state.56 These treaties define basic principles of a legal regime established for foreign investments. The Government Commission for Foreign Investments Supervision is the federal agency in charge of monitoring investment activities of foreign companies and individuals.57 In 2017, the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation ruled that federal tax and regional executive authorities cannot differentiate between Russian and foreign investors and confirmed the eligibility of foreign investors for all tax benefits offered to Russian companies.58    53 Id, art. 1(2); Tax Code, arts. 25.8 – 25.12. 54 Tax Code, art. 25.9. 55 Federal Law No. 96 of Apr. 16, 2022 on Amendments to Part Two of the Tax Code of the Russian Federation and Certain Legislative Acts of the Russian Federation, art. 3, https://perma.cc/TL5R-MSV9 (in Russian). 56 Treaty on Eurasian Economic Union, Protocol 16, Sec. 2, Legal Regime and Protection of Investments, May 29, 2014, 3042 U.N.T.S. 52764, https://perma.cc/HUF8-T2ZA (in Russian). 57 Federal Law No. 69 of Apr. 1, 2020 on Protection and Attraction of Capital Investments in the Russian Federation, art. 4, https://perma.cc/7YUG-3QPW (in Russian).  58 Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, Review of Judicial Practices for Resolution Disputes Related to Protection of Foreign Investors, approved by the Presidium of the Supreme Court  of the Russian Federation, July 12, 2017, https://perma.cc/ZFD9-RV8N (in Russian). \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 151 Russia has 65 bilateral agreements on avoidance of dual taxation.59 No information on tax benefits granted to Russian companies and individuals who invest in projects outside of the Russian Federation has been found.   In February 2022, restrictive measures against citizens and companies from so-called “unfriendly nations” were introduced by the Russian Government as an attempt to counter sanctions imposed on Russia after it attacked Ukraine.60 The list of unfriendly states includes Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the states of the European Union, and a number of other countries.61 A decree by Russia’s president established a new procedure for real estate transactions with the participation of individuals and companies from these countries. Under the new rules, all operations related to land and immovable property, including purchase, gifting, exchange, testing, etc., as well as purchase of any type of securities in Russia, require approval from the Government Commission for Foreign Investments Supervision upon submission of a special application. The decree grants the commission the authority to impose special conditions and requirements for such transactions.62 The Ministry of Finance has since allowed some transactions, e.g., participation in shared construction projects and sale of residential real estate by individuals, and it has clarified the registration requirements for such transactions.63  VII.  Impact of Tax Incentives on Investment Activities of Russian Corporations  According to a Russian scholar, there are more than 3,500 tax benefits and incentives established at federal and regional levels and offered to varied categories of taxpayers. The benefits equal up to one-fifth of the entire amount of taxes collected.64 It appears that there is no single plan that would establish tax incentives stimulating those who invest in areas of national importance. Lawyers and academics note that new incentives are introduced in such a way that they address specific taxes and a limited circle of companies and individuals and do not encourage investments in the long term.65    59 List of International Treaties on Avoidance of Dual Taxation Between the Russian Federation and Other States, Consultant legal database, https://perma.cc/PDW3-KWSH (in Russian).  60 Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 79 of Feb. 28, 2022 on Special Economic Measures in Relation to Unfriendly Actions of the United States of America and Allied Foreign States and International Organizations, https://perma.cc/E4T5-HQDR (in Russian).  61 Government of the Russian Federation, Regulation No. 430 of Mar. 5, 2022, on the List of Foreign States and Territories Committing Unfriendly Actions Against the Russian Federation, Russian Legal Entities and Individuals, https://perma.cc/8YMA-V53X (in Russian). 62 Decree of the Russian Federation President No. 81 of Mar. 1, 2022, on Additional Temporary Economic Measures to Ensure the Financial Stability of the Russian Federation, ConsultantPlus.ru, https://perma.cc/FD7G-26FB (in Russian). 63 Ministry of Finance of the Russian Federation, Resolutions No. 79, 81 on the Permit Issuance Subcommission, https://perma.cc/FVZ6-5K5E (in Russian). 64 Iulia Ledneva, supra note 42, at 150. 65 Alexander Solomentsev, supra note 28, at 141.  \fInvestment Incentives: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 152 A research paper published in 2017 analyzed the impact of tax benefits related to investment activities of Russian corporations. For the purposes of this research, business data of more than 200 corporations registered in the Leningrad province and the Far East administrative district were analyzed. Researchers found similarities in using tax incentives and conducting business operations in all these companies regardless of the region of registration. Based on the types of incentives used and following investment results, these companies were divided in three groups.  • The largest group included companies, which demonstrated increase of assets, increased capitals and reserves, and major investments in their company’s development. Most of them were operating in the field of transportation which is a focused area of investment in both regions. In other business areas, no significant impact of tax privileges on the increase of investment expenditures was observed.  • Another smaller group of companies was not focused on a specific business area. They showed an increase of assets and savings through decreased payments of profit tax. Approximately 1 ruble of tax savings resulted in spending an additional 0.6 ruble for investment purposes.    • The smallest group, which represented 6% of the companies researched, showed that companies actively used tax benefits given to them through other ways and these incentives were not related to investment activities.66           66 Andrei German, Vasilisa Makarova, Impact of Tax Incentives for Investment Activities of Russian Corporations, 4 Izvestiia Dalnevostochnogo Federalnogo Gosudearstvennogo Universiteta, Ekonomika i Manadzhement [Journal of the Far Eastern Federal State University, Economy and Management] 73-82 (2017), https://perma.cc/FGR2-TJ8R (in Russian). \fThe Law Library of Congress 153 South Korea Sayuri Umeda Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY South Korea has a complicated capital gains tax system. Currently, only majority shareholders pay capital gains taxes when shares of listed companies are transferred on a security market. This will change in 2025. In addition to capital gains tax, there is a securities transaction tax that applies to all shareholders. South Korea has many investment incentives, including tax exemptions and tax cuts.   I.  Overview of Korean Taxation   Korea has national and local taxes. National taxes and local taxes include earmarked taxes. Three national taxes, namely income tax, corporate tax, and value-added tax, make up the bulk of Korean tax revenue. Local taxes include acquisition tax, registration license tax, and property tax. There are earmarked taxes, such as the transportation-energy-environment tax, education tax, and special tax for rural development.1  Residents and nonresident individuals who have income from domestic sources are liable to pay income tax.2 A resident individual’s income is composed of global income, retirement income, and capital gains.3 Individual global income is taxed at a progressive marginal tax rate,4 starting at 6.6%, including local income tax, to 384.06 million won (about US$303,340) plus 45% of the amount exceeding KRW1 billion (about US$790,000) and 10% of local tax where the tax base is more than KRWI billion.5 The corporate income tax rates start at 9.9% of tax base to KRW62.58 billion (about US$49.43 million) plus 24% of the amount exceeding KRW300 billion (about US$237 million) and 10% of local tax where the tax base is more than KRW300 billion.6      At present, there are no Law Library of Congress research staff members versed in Korean.

Securities Transaction Tax  Securities transaction tax refers to a tax imposed on the transfer value of shares where the ownership of shares is transferred for value due to a contract or legal causes.7 This tax applies to individuals and corporations.  Persons who transfer shares are liable to pay security transaction taxes. However, when shares are traded on a securities market through a financial investment business, that entity pays the tax.8 A tax base is the transfer value of shares.9 The tax return for transfer of unlisted stocks must be filed within two months from the last day of the half year in which the transfer day falls.10  The rate of the securities transaction tax varies depending on where the shares are transferred. When a transaction occurs at the Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI), the tax rates are 0.05% during 2023 and will be 0.03% during 2024 and zero on or after January 1, 2025. When a transaction takes place at the Korea New Exchange (KONEX), the tax rate is 0.1%. When a transaction occurs at the Korea Securities Dealers Association (KOSDAQ), the tax rate is 0.20% during 2023 and will be 0.18% during 2024 and 0.15 on or after January 1, 2025. In a case of unlisted shares, the tax rate is 0.35%.11  Where shares listed on a foreign securities market are transferred, no securities transaction tax is levied.12  III.  Individual: Capital Gains Tax for Transfer of Shares   Under the Income Tax Act, when two or more capital gains tax rates apply to capital gains, the larger of the calculated tax amounts is the tax amount.13  The following Income Tax provisions also apply to nonprofit domestic corporations.14     7 Securities and Exchange Tax Act, Act No. 3104, Dec. 5, 1978, as amended by Act No. 17655, Dec. 22, 2020, https://perma.cc/TLD9-YVN8.  8 Id. art. 3. 9 Id. art. 7. 10 Id. art. 10. 11 Id. art. 8; Enforcement Decree of Securities and Exchange Tax Act, Presidential Decree No. 9236, Dec. 30, 1978, as amended by Presidential Decree No. 33209, Dec. 31, 2022, art. 5, https://perma.cc/W3AV-JSNF (in Korean). 12 Securities and Exchange Tax Act, Act No. 3104, Dec. 5, 1978, as amended by Act No. 17655, Dec. 22, 2020, art. 2, subpara. 1. 13 Income Tax Act, Act No. 4803, Dec. 22, 1994, as amended by Act No. 19196, Dec. 31, 2022, art. 104, para. 1.  14 Corporate Tax Act, art. 62-2. \fInvestment Incentives: South Korea The Law Library of Congress 155 A.  Shares of Corporations and Tax Rate  The Income Tax Act imposes tax on income generated from transferring shares in the following cases:   1. any of the following shares of a listed corporation: a. shares held by a majority stockholder of a listed corporation,15 who owns stocks worth more than KRW1 billion in a single company and whose stake exceeds 1% of total shares listed on Kospi or 2% of total shares listed on Kosdaq,16 b. shares transferred without trading them on the securities market,17 2. shares of an unlisted corporation, except for unlisted shares of small- or medium-sized cooperatives transferred by a minority shareholder over the counter, and 3. shares issued by a foreign corporation or listed on a market in a foreign country as prescribed by a presidential decree.18   Thus, in cases of transactions of listed shares on securities markets, only majority shareholders are liable for capital gains tax.  When a majority shareholder transfers shares of a listed corporation specified by a presidential decree that is not a small- or medium-sized enterprise, and the shareholder has held them for less than one year, the tax rate is 30% of the tax base of capital gains. The local tax is 3% of the tax base.19   In other cases of scenario 1 above where shares are transferred by majority stockholders, the tax rates are as follows:20  Tax Base Income Tax Rate Local Tax Rate21 KRW300 million (US$240,000) or less 20%  2% More than KRW300 million  KRW60 million (US$47,000) plus 25% of amount exceeding KRW300 million KRW6 million plus 2.5% of amount exceeding KRW300 million   15 Id. art. 94, para. 1, subpara. 3. 16 Enforcement Decree of the Income Tax Act, Presidential Decree No. 14467, Dec. 31, 1994, as amended, art. 157, paras. 4, 5, https://perma.cc/XVZ3-ZF4Z.  17 Shares transferred through an all-inclusive share swap and transfer (article 360-2 or 360-15 of the Commercial Act) or by exercising a stock option for an all-inclusive share swap and transfer (article 360-5 or 360-22 of the Commercial Act) are excluded.

Shares of Corporations with High Value of Real Estate Assets and Tax Rate  When the value of real estate and the related rights of a corporation comprises at least 50% of its total assets, and at least 50% of the shares of the corporation is transferred to other persons by a specified oligopolistic shareholder,24 a capital gains tax is imposed. The value of real estate and the related rights includes not only what the corporation holds directly but also that which is owned by another corporation in which it directly or indirectly holds shares.25 In addition, when the value of real estate and the rights of shares of a corporation engaging in a business specified by a presidential decree comprises at least 80% of its total assets, whether or not a shareholder is an oligopolistic shareholder, the gains from transfer of the shares are subject to capital gains tax.26  In such cases, the tax rate in the table below (the same rate that applies to global income) applies.27 (Capital gains income is calculated separately from the tax base of global income.28)   Tax Base of Global Income Tax Rates29 KRW14 million (US$11,000) or less 6/100 of tax base More than KRW14 million, but not exceeding KRW50 million (US$39,500) KRW840,000 (US$663) + (15/100 of the amount exceeding KRW14 million) More than KRW50 million, but not exceeding KRW88 million (US$69,500) KRW6.24 million (US$4,930)+ (24/100 of the amount exceeding KRW46 million) More than KRW88 million, but not exceeding KRW150 million (US$118,500) KRW15.36 million (US$12,130) + (35/100 of the amount exceeding KRW88 million) More than KRW150 million, but not exceeding KRW300 million (US$237,000) KRW37.06 million (US$29,270) + (38/100 of the amount exceeding KRW150 million)  22 Income Tax Act art. 104, para. 1, subpara. 11, item 2; Local Tax Act art. 103-3, para. 1, subpara. 11(b). 23 Income Tax Act art. 104, para. 1, subpara. 12. 24 A presidential decree specifies who is an oligopolistic shareholder, taking into consideration the ratio of stocks and other matters.

Calculation of Taxable Income  The taxable income is the amount calculated by deducting necessary expenses from the capital gain.31 If a resident has capital gains, KRW2.5 million per year is deducted from each capital gain in the tables in Part III.A and B, above.32   For capital gains from real estate transactions, if the real estate has been held for three years or more, a deduction on taxable income applies depending on the length of time that the asset had been owned.33 However, for capital gains from the transfer of shares, no such deduction exists.  D.  Tax Filing   Residents must file preliminary capital gains tax returns and final returns.   In the case of A above, excluding capital gains from the transfer of shares on a foreign market, a capital gains tax return must be filed within two months from the end of the half-year in which the resident transfers the asset.34 In the case of B above, a resident must file a preliminary tax return two months from the last day of the month in which an asset is transferred.35 When a resident files a preliminary return, he or she must pay the tax amount to a competent local tax office or other designated office.36  A resident with capital gains in the relevant taxable period must file a return on the tax base of the capital gains with the head of the local tax office during the period from May 1 to 31 of the year following that taxable period.37     30 Local Tax Act, art. 92. 31 Income Tax Act, art. 95, para. 1.  32 Id. art. 103, para. 1. 33 Id. art. 95, para. 2. 34 Id. art. 105, para. 1, subpara. 2. 35 Id. art. 105, para. 1, subpara. 1. 36 Id. art. 106, para. 1. 37 Id. art. 110, para. 1. \fInvestment Incentives: South Korea The Law Library of Congress 158 E.

Corporate Tax  The Corporate Tax Act does not treat income from share transactions differently from other income.40 The tax rates are as follows:41  Taxable income Corporate Tax Rate Up to KRW200 million (US$158,000) 9% of tax base Over KRW200 million to KRW20 billion (US$15.8 million) KRW18 million (US$14.220) + (19% of the amount exceeding KRW200 million) Over KRW20 billion to KRW300 billion (US$237 million) KRW3.78 billion (US$29.86 million)+ (21% of the amount exceeding KRW20 billion) Over KRW300 billion KRW62.58 billion (US$49.43 million)+ (24% of the amount exceeding KRW300 billion)  In addition, a local tax that is 10% of the national corporate tax is imposed.42 Capital gains on transfers of land are separately taxed.43   V.  Recent Changes   The South Korean administration then in power announced in 2020 that  a new capital gains tax would be levied on stock investments from Jan. 1, 2023. All investors who trade listed shares with annual capital gains exceeding 50 million won ($37,252) will be subject to a tax rate of 20 percent. Investors that hold more than 300 million won would be levied a 25 percent tax rate. Instead, stock transactions tax would be lowered and the revision would exempt retail investors with annual capital gains below 20 million won.44   38 Tax Treaty, National Tax Service, https://perma.cc/62FX-6334.  39 United Nations Model Tax Convention art. 13, https://perma.cc/483T-PGUT; OECD Model Tax Convention art. 13, https://perma.cc/T6JG-5W3L.  40 Corporate Tax Act art. 4, para. 1. 41 Id. art. 55. 42 Local Tax Act art. 103-20. 43 Corporate Tax Act art. 55-2. 44 Min-kyung Jung, S.

VI.  Investment Promotion  There are numerous investment incentives. The following are examples.  A.  Foreign Investment Promotion Act   Under the Foreign Investment Promotion Act, taxes may be reduced or exempted for foreign investments, as prescribed by the Restriction of Special Taxation Act and the Restriction of Special Local Taxation Act.51 The head of a national or local agency or public institution can lend land or other property that the head manages to a foreign-invested company or allow a foreign-invested  45 Deok-hyun Kim, S.

Act on Restriction on Special Cases Concerning Taxation  The Act on Restriction on Special Cases Concerning Taxation provides tax reductions and exemptions for small- or medium-sized enterprises, research and human resources development, international capital transactions, and investment promotion, among other matters, under various conditions. 55  The act also includes special taxation of foreigners’ investments. For example, foreign investment for operating one of the specified businesses is eligible for a reduction of, or exemption from, corporate tax, income tax, acquisition tax, and property tax if the investment meets the conditions. Such businesses include a business that requires a technology essential for the new growth engine industry, a business eligible for operation in regional special zones, or a business operated by a foreign-capital-invested company that occupies a free economic zone.56    52 Id. art. 13. 53 Id. art. 14-2. 54 Id. art. 18 55 Act on Restriction on Special Cases Concerning Taxation, Act No. 5584, Dec. 28, 1998, as amended by Act No. 19430, June 9, 2023, https://perma.cc/MM6V-7C7D (in Korean). 56 Id. art. 121-2, para. 1. \fThe Law Library of Congress 161 Sweden Elin Hofverberg Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Sweden taxes three different types of income: income derived from work or hobbies (“earned income”), income derived from business activity, and income derived from capital. Earned income is taxed by the state when it exceeds the threshold of 598,500 Swedish krona (SEK) (about US$57,550). The state tax rate on earned income is 20%. Income from business is taxed at 20.6%, and income from capital is taxed at 30%. Income from capital and business activity, unlike earned income, is not taxed by the municipalities or the regions.   Sweden has implemented incentives for individuals to invest in corporations. For example, the investment deduction incentive allows individuals to deduct up to SEK 650,000 (about US$62,500) for investments they make in new businesses. The business must be a limited company and operate in Sweden, though it need not be Swedish-owned if it is headquartered in the European Economic Area (EEA) or in a country with which Sweden has a tax treaty that allows for information exchange. In addition, individuals may hold stock in investment savings accounts, on which profits are taxed using a standard deduction based on the amount held and not the actual profits made. Losses are not deductible under this scheme.   Sweden also has special rules for the taxation of “few owner companies” whereby part of their dividend is taxed as capital and part as earned income.     I. Introduction  Income tax is regulated in the Swedish Income Tax Act.1 Swedish law distinguishes between physical persons, legal persons, estates, and foundations.   A. Unlimited versus Limited Tax Liability  Under Swedish law a person may be subject to unlimited tax liability (obegränsat skattskyldig) or to limited tax liability (begränsat skattskyldig).2 A person that is obegränsat skattskyldig pays taxes on all income derived worldwide, whereas a person that is begränsat skattskyldig pays taxes only on income that has a connection to Sweden.3 A physical person who resides in, habitually stays in (stadigvarande vistas), or has considerable connection to (väsentlig anknytning) and has previously lived in Sweden is subject to unlimited tax liability in Sweden.4  1 Inkomstskattelag (IL) (SFS 1999:1229), https://perma.cc/J2RZ-L5MP. 2 3 ch. 1, 3, 8, 17 §§ IL. 3 Id. 4 Id. 3 ch. 3, 7 §§. \fInvestment Incentives: Sweden The Law Library of Congress 162 B. Types of Taxable Income  The Income Tax Act defines what constitutes taxable income. For example, it specifically provides that acquisitions from inheritance, gifts, or wealth are tax-free in Sweden.5 Most income derived from competition winnings are also free of tax.6  There are three types of taxable income under the Income Tax Act: income derived from work or hobbies (earned income) (inkomst från tjänst) (chapters 10–12), business activity (näringsverksamhet) (chapters 13–40), and capital (kapital) (chapters 41–43).7 Capital gains and capital losses are regulated in chapters 44–55.    Capital gains and losses are defined in chapter 41, section 1 as income or expenses that stem from the holding of assets and debts, such as capital gains and capital losses, and that do not belong to the income from a business activity.8  II. Tax Rates  A. Municipal Tax and Region Tax (Kommunalskatt odch regionskatt)  Each of the 290 municipalities in the country set a local municipal tax that pays for the local government and local public services. The 21 larger regions (made up of several municipalities) also set taxes that, among other things, pay for the regional health care system.9 Persons who no longer reside in Sweden but are unlimitedly liable for taxes pay the municipal tax and region tax in the municipality and region to which they have the closest connection (e.g., where they own property or where their immediate family resides).10 Persons who have only limited tax liability pay a 25% municipal tax.11    5 8 ch. 2 §. Sweden previously imposed taxes on gifts, inheritances, and wealth. The inheritance and gift taxes were repealed in 2004 by Proposition 2004/05:25, Slopad arvsskatt och gåvoskatt, https://perma.cc/K8RR-P438. The wealth tax was repealed in 2007 by Lag om upphävande av lagen (1997:323) om statlig förmögenhetsskatt (SFS 2007:1403), https://perma.cc/6DV4-BAYM. The tax rate at the time of the repeal was 1.5% for physical persons and estates, and 1.5 per thousand for legal entities.

State Income Tax (Statlig inkomstskatt)  The state income tax rate is 20% on any amount that exceeds a set threshold value. For the income year of 2019, the threshold was 490,700 SEK (about US$47,115).12 For 2023, the threshold value for paying state income tax is SEK 598,500 (about US$57,550), meaning one pays state income tax on any amount that exceeds this amount.13 The taxable income is subject to a standard deduction of SEK 15,400 (about US$1,480) for persons under 66 and SEK 84,700 (about US$8,145) for persons over 66. In practice, this means that persons 66 and older pay 20% state tax on any income that exceeds SEK 683,200 (about US$65,690), and persons younger than 66 pay state income tax on any income in excess of SEK 613,900 (about US$59,025).14  C. Capital Gains Tax for Physical Persons  The state tax rate for income derived from capital gains is 30%15 There is no municipal or region tax on capital gains.  D. Corporate Tax Rate  The corporate tax rate in Sweden, which applies to legal entities, is 20.6%.16 Corporate entities do not pay municipal tax.  III.  Individual Incentives  A. Special Investment Deduction for Physical Persons  In 2013, the Swedish government introduced a tax incentive for risk capital investment, known as investeraravdrag (literally, “investment deduction”), with the intent of incentivizing taxpayer investment in new corporations.17 The investment deduction is reserved for physical persons and estates only.18 The person making the deduction must be liable for tax on capital gains in Sweden, and the capital gain must not be exempted from tax liability because of a tax treaty.19 Thus, the right to make a deduction applies both to persons who are subject to unlimited tax liability and  12 Id. 65 ch. 5 §. 13 Svar pa vanliga fragor, Inkomst av tjanst, nar ska man betala statlig inkomstskatt och hur hog ar den?

Chapter 43, section 2 of the Income Tax Act defines companies that may be invested in as follows:    1. a Swedish limited company [akitebolag], 2. a Swedish Economic Association [ekonomisk förening], [or] 3. a foreign company that is equivalent to a Swedish limited liability company or a Swedish Economic Association and that has a permanent place of operation in Sweden, if it belongs to a state within the European Economic Area or to a state with which Sweden has a tax treaty that includes informational exchange.  A company is not: 1. an investment company, 2. an economic association or a limited company whose business consists in whole or in part of providing the members or co-owners with housing, garages or any other device intended for their personal account in a building owned by the association or the company, 3. a cooperative society, or  4. such an economic association which is the central organization for cooperative associations.21  In addition, companies that are active in shipbuilding, coal, or steel industries are not eligible for the investment deduction.22 The company must predominantly be active in business (bedriver rörelse), meaning it cannot solely hold cash, stock, or similar assets.23 Deductions apply only to investments that have been made in cash, or that were acquired at the formation of the company or through issuance of new shares, financial contribution in the form of a membership contribution (medlemsinsats), or capital contribution by a nonmember (förlagsinsats).24 In addition, the person or estate making the deduction must hold the share at the end of the payment year.25  The investment deduction may not exceed SEK 650,000 (about US$62,500) per tax year, which corresponds to acquisition of shares worth SEK 1.3 million (about US$125,000).26 If the shares are liquidated within five years, the investment deduction must be repaid.27  The investment deduction is considered state support under EU rules on risk capital investments and is therefore subject to approval by the European Commission.28   20 Id. 21 Id. 43 ch. 2 §. 22 Id. 43 ch. 14 § 2 st. 23 Id. 43 ch. 14 §; Investeraravdrag och Villkor för Företaget, Skatteverket, https://perma.cc/K6VN-WC9F. 24 43 ch. 12 § IL.

Investment Saving Accounts  Individuals may invest in investment saving accounts.30 The taxation of the investment savings account is regulated in chapter 42, section 35 of the Income Tax Act.31 For investment savings accounts, taxes are not levied on the basis of the capital gains the taxpayer makes, but capital held in investment savings accounts is taxed using standard deductions (shabloner) on the basis of the average amount held during the year, calculated by adding the amount held during the end of each quarter as well as any deposits made during the year and dividing it by four.32 This average is known as the capital base amount. A standard profit is calculated by multiplying the base amount by 1.25%.33 That amount is then taxed as capital gains.34 Losses on investments held in a savings accounts are not eligible for capital deductions.35 Investment saving accounts are taxed as capital at 30%.36  C. Delayed Income Tax on Real Property Gains  Capital profits derived from the sale of real property within Sweden or the EEA are subject to delayed taxation if the real property is a private property and the profits were used to purchase another private property within the EEA either the year preceding the sale, the year of the sale, or the year following the sale of the original property.37 There is no similar delayed taxation for commercial property.  IV.  Corporate Incentives  A. Companies with Fewer than Four Majority Share Holders (3:12 Rules)  Special tax rules apply to fåmansföretag (few owner companies), meaning corporations that have four or fewer owners holding more than 50% of the votes in the company and that are not traded on a regulated market.38 Persons who work in small corporations may be subject both to capital  29 Vem får göra investeraravdrag och när?, Skatteverket, https://perma.cc/33TR-S3SG. 30 Lag om investeringssparkonto (SFS 2011:1268), https://perma.cc/X7DL-B9MA.

The rate of corporation income tax is 20%, whereas individual income is subject to progressive rates ranging from 5% to 40%. Notably, dividends or earnings received by a company from its investment in other domestic companies are excluded from taxable income.   Taiwan has laws that offer research and development credits to qualified enterprises for their research and development expenses. Other laws offer tax incentives to specific businesses or industries that are promoted by the government, including those involved in public infrastructure projects, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, and tourism. Moreover, investors may benefit from tax incentives if they choose to operate within certain areas like free-trade zones.   I.  Introduction  In Taiwan, the corporation income tax (“profit-seeking enterprise income tax”) and the individual income tax (“consolidated income tax”) are both governed by the Income Tax Act, which was most recently amended in April 2021.1 The law does not impose a separate capital gains tax. While the Income Tax Act applies special taxes to transactions of real property,2 gains from selling other properties are commonly included in the general tax base and subject to the same rate as ordinary income, unless specifically exempted or otherwise regulated by law.  A.

Income from property transactions includes any income derived from transactions of property and rights. 8  The consolidated income is subject to progressive rates ranging from 5% to 40%.9  Only half of the income of an individual derived from transactions in registered stocks or registered corporate bonds issued by a company limited by shares is calculated into the consolidated income tax, as long as the individual has held such stocks or bonds for a year or longer. The other half is exempted from income tax.10    4 Id. art. 5. 5 Id. 6 Id. art. 42. 7 Id. art. 14. 8 Id. 9 Id. art. 5. 10 Id. \fInvestment Incentives: Taiwan The Law Library of Congress 169 II.  Tax Incentives  A.  Incentives for Industrial Innovation and Small and Medium Enterprises  To promote industrial innovation, the Statute for Industrial Innovation offers research and development (R & D) credits for qualified research and development expenses incurred, with the maximum amount of tax credit capped at 30% of the tax payable for the year in which the expenses were incurred. Qualified enterprises may elect one of the following methods to calculate the R & D credits:  • Up to 15% of qualified R & D expenses for the current year, with credits limited to the same year, or • Up to 10% of qualified R & D expenses for the current year, which can be carried forward for two years following the current year.11  Qualified small and medium enterprises may also apply for such R & D credits in accordance with the Act for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises.12  Moreover, the Statute for Industrial Innovation provides incentives for individuals who invest at least NT$1 million (about US$31,912) in newly established domestic companies that are identified by the central authority as high-risk innovative startups. Once the individual holds the shares for two years, up to 50% of the investment will be excluded from the individual’s consolidated income for the year in which the second anniversary of the shareholding falls. The aggregate amount excludable from an individual’s consolidated income each year in accordance with this provision is capped at NT$3 million (about US$95,735).13  B.  Other Incentives  There are other Taiwanese laws that offer tax incentives to specific businesses or industries that are promoted by the government, including  • public infrastructure projects,14 • transportation infrastructure projects,15  11 Statute for Industrial Innovation (amended Jan. 19, 2023), art. 10, https://perma.cc/V8JG-L7DF (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/65KD-4KJX (English translation). 12 Act for Development of Small and Medium Enterprises (amended Jan. 6, 2016), art. 35, https://perma.cc/4EDS-XXCR (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/QC7Y-XQR9 (English translation). 13 Statute for Industrial Innovation art. 23-2. 14 Act for Promotion of Private Participation in Infrastructure Projects (amended Dec. 21, 2022), https://perma.cc/HC5T-T7EG (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/RET4-6AVP (English translation). 15 Statute for Encouragement of Private Participation in Transportation Infrastructure Projects (amended June 17, 2015), https://perma.cc/S49W-RHET (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/HK96-3QH9 (English translation). \fInvestment Incentives: Taiwan The Law Library of Congress 170 • the biotech and pharmaceutical industries,16  • the tourism industry,17 • development of new towns,18 and • urban renewal projects.19  III.  Free-Trade Zones  Investors may benefit from tax incentives if they choose to operate within certain areas such as free-trade zones. According to the International Airport Park Development Act and the Act for the Establishment and Management of Free Trade Zones, companies that perform solely preparatory or ancillary activities within Taiwan and engage in or appoint a free-trade zone entity to engage in procurement, importation, storage, or delivery activities within a free-trade zone can apply for income tax exemption on the income from sales of goods.20  This profit-seeking enterprise income tax exemption is set to remain effective through 2042.21  IV.  Overseas Investment  No special incentives were identified for Taiwanese corporations and individuals investing overseas. According to the Statute for Industrial Innovation, Taiwanese companies seeking to invest overseas are generally required to apply for approval from the central competent authority before making the investment, whereas overseas investments of NT$1.5 billion (about US$48 million) or less may be reported to the central competent authority after the investment has been made.22   16 Act for the Development of Biotech and Pharmaceutical Industry (amended Dec. 30, 2021), https://perma.cc/HBZ6-CRPQ (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/2J95-G7WB (English translation). 17 Act for the Development of Tourism (amended May 18, 2022), https://perma.cc/BC4Z-C5EA (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/77UH-UGBU (English translation). 18 New Town Development Act (amended Jan. 5, 2020), https://perma.cc/K782-MK35 (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/Z5Y8-X364 (English translation). 19 Urban Renewal Act (amended May 8, 2021), https://perma.cc/QGY8-PJDD (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/HPD4-LU54 (English translation). 20 International Airport Park Development Act (amended Jan. 16, 2019), art. 35, https://perma.cc/B2YZ-ZV7Y (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/7GTM-H69A (English translation); Act for the Establishment and Management of Free Trade Zones (amended Jan. 16, 2019), art. 29, https://perma.cc/UW7A-4P3G (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/LK8B-S5SY (English translation). 21 Id. 22 Statute for Industrial Innovation art. 22. \fThe Law Library of Congress 171 Turkey Kayahan Cantekin Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Turkish laws establishing income and corporate taxes incorporate various provisions that provide advantageous tax treatment for dividend and profit distributions under certain circumstances and for certain types of capital gains. These include income deriving from investments made in equity securities quoted on Turkish exchanges, certain debt securities, and the long-term holding of securities and real estate for certain natural and legal person taxpayers. Among other means, advantageous treatment is granted through full or partial exemptions, the use of flat-rate withholdings at realization, and preferential rates, such as the special rate that applies to securities traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. This report provides an overview of selected provisions of the Law on Income Tax and the Law on Corporate Tax that provide for such tax advantages.   I.  Introduction   A. Brief Overview of the Turkish Tax System and Scope of Report  According to Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) statistics, the main tax categories that contributed to total Turkish tax revenue in 2020 (excluding social security contributions) were the individual income tax (3.1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP)), corporate tax (2.1%), value-added tax (4.6%), and excise taxes on specific goods and services (5.3%).1   Reflecting these categories, the main substantive legislation of the Turkish tax system that establishes the major tax headings are the Law on Income Tax (LIT), the Law on Corporate Tax (LCT), the Law on Value-Added Tax (LVAT), and other laws that establish excise taxes, the main ones being the Law on Special Consumption Tax (LSCT) and the Law on Outlay Taxes (LOT).2 Furthermore, the three main types of wealth taxes in the Turkish tax system are established by the Law on Property Tax (LPT), the Law on Motor Vehicles Tax (LMVT), and the Law on Inheritance and Gift Tax (LIGT).3  1 OECD, Revenue Statistics 2022: The Impact of Covid-19 on OECD Tax Revenues, 1965-2021 149 (2022), https://perma.cc/VLU6-J9NP.

Although advantageous rules incentivizing investments in specific activities or specific sectors of the economy can be found throughout the tax system, general exemptions and tax preferences incorporated in the LIT and LCT appear to constitute the main instruments of tax policy regarding investment in capital markets and incentivization of corporate activity. Part II is an overview of advantageous tax treatments available to natural person taxpayers under the LIT. Part III summarizes such treatment of legal entities subject to corporate taxation under the LCT.  B.  The LIT and the LCT   The LIT provides the definitions of various types of taxable income, establishes the tax to be paid by natural person taxpayers on their taxable income, and sets forth various exemptions. Income tax is mainly assessed on the basis of a declaration; however, the LIT provides for withholding at the source for certain types of income under various circumstances. Income tax rates are progressive. They are assessed in five tax brackets (15%, 20%, 27%, 35%, and 40%), with a broader thus more advantageous 27% bracket for middle-income taxpayers whose main income is employment income.5  Table: Income Tax Brackets Taxable income Income Tax Up to Turkish Lira (TL) 70,000 (approx. US$2,675) 15% of taxable income Over TL70,000 but not over TL150,000 (approx. US$5,735) TL10,500 (approx. US$400) plus 20% of the excess over TL70,000 Over TL150,000 but not over TL370,000 (approx. US$14,150) or not over TL550,000 (approx. US$21,030) for employment income TL26,500 (approx. US$1,015) plus 27% of the excess over TL150,000 Over TL370,000 (or over TL550,000 for employment income) but not over TL1,900,000 (approx. US$72,655) TL85,900 (approx.

US$23,760) plus 40% of the excess over TL1,900,000, or TL607,000 (approx. US$23,210) plus 40% of the excess over TL1,900,000 for employment income    4 Vergi Usul Kanunu (LPC), Law No. 213, O.G.

No. 32059ter, Dec. 30, 2022, https://perma.cc/5PCU-CN7K. \fInvestment Incentives: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 173 The LIT makes a distinction between “taxpayers subject to full taxation” and “taxpayers subject to limited taxation” (i.e., resident taxpayers versus nonresident taxpayers) on the basis of domicile, the general rule being that taxpayers domiciled in Turkey pay income tax on all income, while those who are not domiciled in Turkey pay tax only on income earned in Turkey.6   The LCT establishes a corporate tax for legal business entities (“corporate taxpayers”). The LCT uses the income definitions on the LIT; however, it states that all types of income for corporate tax purposes must be calculated using the methods provided for commercial income in the LIT and the TPC.7 The LCT sets forth various corporate tax exemptions with regard to income generated in diverse areas of corporate activity. The general corporate tax rate is 20% for 2023 (23% for 2022), with certain exceptions, such as a less advantageous rate of 25% for some financial institutions, and a bonus discount up to 2% from the general rate to be determined by the government for companies that have made an initial public offering in the Istanbul Stock Exchange within the tax year, according to their area of business activity.8 The LCT also distinguishes between taxpayers subject to full taxation and taxpayers subject to limited taxation on the basis of domicile, with taxpayers incorporated in Turkey or whose headquarters are located in Turkey being considered domiciled in Turkey.9  II. Advantageous Tax Treatment Available for Individual Taxpayers with Regard to Income Derived from Equity Investments and Investments in Equity and Debt Securities and Real Estate Under the LIT  A.  Income Derived from Securities and Other Equity Interests  1.  Exemption from Income Tax of Income Earned from Sale of Securities Held More Than Two Years  The LIT subjects the increase in the value of securities to income tax only at realization. The increase in value subject to taxation is calculated by subtracting the cost of acquisition of the relevant interest (the tax basis) and sales expenses from the proceeds arising from the realization event.10 For the purposes of realization, the tax basis is indexed for inflation if the domestic producer price index has moved more than 10% between the date of acquisition and the month preceding the month of sale.11 The sale, trade, assignment for value, condemnation, nationalization, or contribution as capital in a business association of a security, capital market instrument, or other equity interest is recognized as a realization event.12    6 LIT arts. 3-8. 7 LCT art. 6; Gelir İdaresi Başkanlığı, Kurumlar Vergisi Beyan Rehberi [Corporate Tax Declaration Guide] 6 (2023), https://perma.cc/G4KF-9U3S. 8 LCT art. 32, provisional art. 13; Corporate Tax Declaration Guide, supra note 7, at 54.  9 LCT art. 3. 10 LIT art. 81bis.  11 Id.; LPC art. 298bis; Gelir İdaresi Başkanlığı, Diğer Kazanç ve İratların Vergilendirilmesi Rehberi [Taxation of Other Earnings and Rents Handbook] 16-17 (2023), https://perma.cc/CBE2-NHXL. 12 LIT art. 81bis. \fInvestment Incentives: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 174 The income tax code generally classifies income arising from the realization of the increase in value of equity securities and other capital markets instruments as taxable “appreciation” income, provided that the instruments are acquired for value and held less than two years.13 Income arising from a sale occurring at least two years after acquisition is not considered taxable income for income tax purposes.14 However, for taxpayers who are in the business of dealing in securities in their own name, the same income is classified as commercial income and is taxable for income tax purposes regardless of the holding period.15   2.  Advantageous Flat Tax Rate for Income Arising from the Sale of Certain Equity Securities Traded on Turkish Exchanges  Provisional article 67 of the ITC provides a special rule for income derived from the sale of shares of companies subject to full taxation that are traded on the Istanbul Stock Exchange and shares of investment funds in which more than 51% of the portfolio consists of securities that trade on the Istanbul Stock Exchange. Realized income derived from the sale of such securities is not taxable after a holding period of one year, rather than two per the general rule.16   Income derived from the sale of certain securities is subject to a special withholding tax at an advantageous rate and not otherwise required to be declared as income. Specifically, income derived from the sale or lending of securities or other capital market instruments that are issued in Turkey and either registered with the Capital Markets Board or traded on securities and futures and options exchanges established in Turkey are subject to a flat rate withholding tax, which is currently set at 0%.17  B.  Income Derived from Debt Securities  The realization of the increase in value of all kinds of debt securities issued by the Treasury or other public legal entities and interest income earned from these instruments are also subject to withholding tax in accordance with provisional article 67 of the ITC, and they are otherwise not required to be declared as income. Currently, the withholding tax rate is set at 10% for government debt instruments issued after January 1, 2026, 0% for domestic debt securities based on gold, and 0% for debt instruments issued between December 22, 2021, and June 30, 2023 (inclusive).18  13 LIT art. 80bis.  14 Id. 15 LIT art. 37/1(5). 16 Id. provisional art. 67/1(6). 17 Id. provisional art. 67/1; Council of Ministers Decision No. 2012/3141 of Apr. 27, 2012, O.G.

The withholding rate for these securities range between 15% to 0% according to the class of issuer and maturity date.19  C.  Dividends and Other Distributions Derived from Equity Interests  All kinds of dividends and profit distributions paid to holders of equity interests in business entities, including those represented by equity securities of joint-stock companies, or membership or partnership interests in limited liability companies or partnerships, are considered taxable income. Taxpayers must declare such income if it surpasses a certain threshold in a calendar year (TL70,000 for the year 2022, approx. US$ 2,675).20 The LIT provides an exemption that exempts 50% of such income from income tax.21 Entities making the distribution are required to make a 10% withholding at payment, to be later credited in tax filings made by the taxpayer.22   D.  Income Derived from Sale of Real Property  Income derived from the realization of the increase in the value of real estate acquired for value is taxable as “appreciation income” if the real estate is sold within five years of its acquisition.23 The taxable gain is calculated by subtracting from the sale price of the real estate the tax base (cost of acquisition) reduced by claimed depreciation deductions.24 As is the case for securities, the tax basis is indexed for inflation at realization if the domestic producer price index has moved more than 10% between the date of acquisition and the month preceding the month of sale.25  Income arising from a sale occurring at least five years after acquisition is not considered taxable income and, therefore, it is not subject to income or corporate tax. However, for taxpayers who are in the construction business or deal in real property, the same income is classified as commercial income and is taxable regardless of the holding period.26     Geçici 67nci Madde Uygulaması İle İlgili Olarak Gerçek Kişilere Yönelik Vergi Rehberi [Provisional Article 67 Handbook for Natural Person Taxpayers] 15 (2023), https://perma.cc/5T64-B2AQ. 19 Council of Ministers Decision No. 2010/926, supra note 18; Presidential Decisions No. 2569 of May 23, 2020, O.G.

Advantageous Tax Treatment for Certain Investments Available for Corporate Taxpayers Under the LCT  A.  Advantageous Tax Treatment of Income Derived from Certain Equity Investments as a Result of Profit Distributions or Sale  The following forms of income are exempt from corporate tax under the LCT:29  • Gains derived by a corporate taxpayer from its equity in another company subject to full taxation. • Profit distributions made to a corporate taxpayer by another company subject to full taxation on the basis of its articles of association or dividend certificates held by the taxpayer. • Income from equity shares of venture capital investment funds and venture capital investment partnerships that are subject to full taxation, and income arising from the return of shares to the fund or partnership. • Profit distributions or dividends arising from taxpayer’s equity shares in other investment funds subject to full taxation and income arising from the return of shares to the fund (excluding income from equity held in investment funds that hold foreign currency denominated assets, gold, and other precious metals or instruments based on these in their portfolio). • Income derived from the realization of the increase in the value of equity in venture capital investment funds or partnerships and other investment funds arising from the subject special tax base valuation rules that the Tax Procedure Code provides for investment funds in which shares of companies registered in Turkey comprise at least 51% of the portfolios.30   A corporate taxpayer may benefit from the exemptions for income derived from equity interests described above with relation to equity that the taxpayer holds in foreign companies, under the following circumstances:   27 Id. art. 22/1. 28 Id. 29 LCT art. 5/1(a).  30 TPC art. 279 provides that the tax base of equity shares in such funds must be evaluated according to the cost of acquisition regardless of market price.  \fInvestment Incentives: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 177 • the company in which the taxpayer holds equity is a joint-stock company, limited liability company, or equivalent,  • the company is not incorporated or headquartered in Turkey, • at least 10% of the company’s paid-in capital is contributed by the taxpayer, • the equity in the company is continuously held for at least a year at the time the income from equity is derived,  • the income from equity is subject to an aggregate tax burden of at least 15% under the tax laws of the jurisdiction in which the company operates (including the taxation of the corporate gains that create the basis of the income from equity); or if the company’s main area of operation is the provision of financing or insurance services, or investment in securities, the income is subject to an aggregate tax burden that is at least equivalent to the applicable corporate tax rate in Turkey, and  • the income from equity is transferred to Turkey before the latest date on which the corporate tax declaration must be filed for the accounting period in which the income is earned.31  Furthermore, gains made by joint-stock companies from the sale of equity interests in foreign companies are exempt from corporate tax under the following circumstances:  • the company in which the taxpayer holds equity is a joint-stock company, limited liability company, or equivalent,  • foreign equity stock has comprised at least 75% of the aggregate assets of the taxpayer continuously for at least a year by the date of the sale of the equity, and the taxpayer has held at least 10% equity in each of its foreign affiliates, • the taxpayer has held the equity stock that is sold in its asset account for at least 730 days at the date of sale.32   B.  Advantageous Tax Treatment of Income Derived from Sale of Equity Securities and Real Estate Held Long-Term  Under certain conditions, income arising from the sale of real property and equity securities is exempt for corporate taxpayers that do not deal in real property or securities. The exemption is available for both full taxpayers and limited taxpayers, if qualified. Accordingly, taxpayers may exempt from corporate tax 75% of the income derived from the sale of equity stock, dividend interests, and investment fund participation stock that they have held in their assets account for at least two years and 50% of the income derived from the sale of real estate that was held in the asset account for the same time period.     31 LCT art. 5/1(b).  32 Id. art. 5/1(c).  \fInvestment Incentives: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 178 The exemption is subject to the following conditions:  • the taxpayer is not in the business of dealing in real estate or securities,  • the real property and equity interest in question is held in the assets account of the taxpayer for at least 730 days, • the part of the proceeds of the sale of the assets that benefit from the exemption must be held in a special account for five years following the sale. If, within the five-year period, proceeds are transferred to another account except for addition to capital, withdrawn from the enterprise, or transferred abroad by a taxpayer subject to limited taxation, or if the taxpayer enters into liquidation, the exemption will be canceled, the amount will be taxed with penalty, and interest will be charged.33   C.  Advantageous Tax Treatment of Income Derived from Trade in Securities Available to Investment Companies  While taxation of proceeds from the trade in securities is generally subject to taxation through withholdings,34 investment funds and investment partnerships that are established in Turkey can benefit from exemptions from further corporate taxation of such proceeds and of income arising from their provision of asset management services.   Accordingly, the following types of income are exempt from corporate tax for these taxpayers (but not exempt from other applicable withholdings):   • income from portfolio management services earned by securities investment funds and partnerships established in Turkey,  • income from portfolio management services earned by investment funds and partnerships established in Turkey whose portfolios consist mainly of gold and other precious metals that are traded on exchanges established in Turkey,  • income earned by venture capital investment funds or partnerships,  • income earned by real estate investment funds or partnerships, • income earned by retirement investment funds, and • income earned by residential and asset financing funds.35     33 Id. art. 5/1(e). 34 See Part II, supra, with regard to withholding tax under art. 67 of the LIT. 35 LCT art. 5/1(d). \fInvestment Incentives: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 179 IV.  Tax Treaty with the United States  Turkey entered into an income tax treaty with the United States (US) in 1996.36 The treaty applies, on the Turkish side, to the income tax, corporate tax, and levies imposed on the income and corporate taxes, and on the US side, to federal income taxes imposed by the Internal Revenue Code (but excluding the accumulated earnings tax, the personal holding company tax, and social security taxes), and the excise taxes imposed with respect to private foundations.37  The treaty provides maximum rates for certain types of income, protections from double taxation, anti-abuse rules, rules regarding exchange of information with regard to fiscal evasion, and rules limiting benefits to persons engaged in treaty shopping.38 The treaty sets a maximum rate of 20% for the taxation of dividends at the source country, with an exception that the maximum rate will be 10% if the dividends are paid to a corporation that owns at least 10% of the payor.39 Furthermore, the treaty provides that the general maximum rate is 15% for taxation of interest in the source country, with the exception of loans made by financial institutions, which will be taxed at a maximum rate of 10%.40 The Letter of Submittal includes the following note regarding the taxation of capital gains under the treaty:  The taxation of capital gains under the Agreement is essentially the same as under most recent U.S. tax treaties. In general, except for real property and business property, the country of the seller’s residence is given the exclusive right to tax capital gains. A limited exception to this general rule relates to the alienation of corporate shares. Under the exemption, one Contracting State may, in accordance with its law, tax a resident of the other State on the gain from the alienation of shares issued by a corporation that is a resident of the first Contracting State if (i) the shares are not quoted on a stock exchange in the first Contracting State; (ii) the shares are alienated to a resident of that State; and (iii) the seller held the securities for one year or less.

The UK has different tax brackets for both income tax and capital gains tax that are based on an individual’s annual income. The UK does not impose a net worth tax on individuals or companies.    The UK has introduced a number of plans providing relief from capital gains tax to encourage investment in small, start-up companies, particularly those that are knowledge intensive. There are a number of criteria that must be met by both the investor and company in order to qualify for the plan, and investments must be held for a certain period of time, otherwise the tax relief will not apply. The UK also has a number of provisions affording tax relief to employees who exercise stock options and for businesses that apply on the disposal of all or part of their assets.    I. Introduction  Individuals resident and domiciled in the United Kingdom (UK) are taxed on their worldwide income and gains in the UK,1 subject to the provisions of any tax treaties, and thus any foreign source capital gains are fully taxable in the UK.2 The UK does not impose a net worth tax on individuals or companies.3 The UK has a number of plans that provide tax relief for investors designed to make “the UK the best place to start, finance and expand a business in Europe.”4 It has four venture capital plans: the Enterprise Investment Scheme (EIS); the Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme (SEIS); the Social Investment Tax Relief (SITR); and the Venture Capital Trust (VCT) that apply to companies not listed on a recognized stock exchange.5 The plans are designed to encourage “investment in early–stage companies that have the intention to grow and develop  1 HMRC Internal Manual, Residence, Domicile and Remittance Basis Manual, HM Revenue & Customs (Mar. 9, 2016), https://perma.cc/936C-BXX9.  2 United Kingdom, Country Tax Guides, Individual Taxation, 7.

Tax Rates  A. Income Tax Rates  There is a personal allowance for earnings from all sources of less than 12,570 pounds (approximately US$16,133), which has a zero percent tax rate. Earnings from all sources between £12,570 to less than £50,270 (approximately US$16,133 to US$64,520) are charged at the basic rate of tax, which is currently 20%. Earnings from £50,270 to less than £125,139 (approximately US$64,520 to US$160,612) are charged at the high-rate of tax, which is currently 40%, and all earnings over £125,140 (approximately US$160,613) are charged at the additional rate of tax, which is currently 45%.8 The income rate brackets for Scotland differ slightly from England, Wales, and Northern Ireland. In Scotland, the starter rate for tax is 19% on income over £12,571 to £14,732 (US$16,134 to $18,908); the Scottish basic rate is 20% for income over £14,733 to £25,688 (approximately US$18,909 to US$32,969); the intermediate rate is 21% for income over £25,689 to £43,662 (approximately US$32,971 to US$56,039); the higher rate is 42% for income over £43,663 to £125,140 (approximately US$56,040 to US$160,614), and the top rate is 47% for income over £125,140 (approximately US$160,614).9  B. Capital Gains Tax Rates  Capital gains tax is charged to individuals who are normally resident in the UK on any chargeable gains that have accrued in a tax year (April 6 to April 5) due to the disposal of assets after deducting any allowable losses.10 All forms of property are considered to be assets for the purposes of the act, including those situated outside the UK.11 Thus, capital gains tax is charged on the disposal of all shares, foreign and domestic, that result in a gain, as determined on the date of the contract of sale.  The amount of capital gains individuals are liable for depends upon the tax bracket they are in and the type of asset being disposed of.12 Individuals in a higher rate (currently 40%) income tax bracket or above are charged a 20% capital gains tax.13 The amount of capital gains chargeable to  6 Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief Statistics: 2023, HM Revenue & Customs (May 17, 2023), https://perma.cc/W8UQ-C4F6. 7 Use a Venture Capital Scheme to Raise Money for Your Company, HM Revenue & Customs (last updated May 25, 2023), https://perma.cc/FA4V-D58X. 8 Income Tax Rates and Personal Allowances, Gov.uk, https://perma.cc/VWW7-YGAQ.  9 Income Tax Rates and Personal Allowances, Mygov.scot (last updated June 30, 2023), https://perma.cc/N379-863T.  10 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, § 1, https://perma.cc/3JLE-Z7BW.  11 Id. § 21.  12 Capital Gains Tax Rates and Allowances, HM Revenue & Customs (June 4, 2018), https://perma.cc/5U3S-SQ85.  13 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, § 1(H)(3). \fInvestment Incentives: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 182 a basic rate tax payer (currently 20%) depends upon the size of the gain. The rate for capital gains taxed was substantially reduced in April 2016 from 18% to 10% for basic rate tax payers and from 28% to 20% for higher rate tax payers.14   When determining the gain, a capital gains tax free allowance for the year 2022-23 is £12,300 (approximately US$15,786).15 This will be reduced to £6,000 (approximately US$7,700) for the year 2023-24 and to £3,000 (approximately US$3,850) for the year 2024-25.16 This amount may be subtracted from the gain, and any gain within the basic rate of tax is chargeable at 10%, while any gain over this amount is chargeable at 20%.17 The amount of capital gains tax due is calculated on the gain made upon the sale of the asset, which is the date the contract to sell was entered into or, in the case of a conditional contract, the date the conditions were met.18   The capital gains chargeable to the profits of the sale of residential property are taxed differently from the sale of shares. Capital gains tax on residential property is chargeable at 18% for those charged the basic rate of tax (earnings less than £50,270, approximately US$64,520) and 28% for those charged at the higher rate or tax or above (earnings over £50,270, approximately US$64,520).19  III. Tax Relief for Investors  Investors may receive capital gains tax relief, where the gains on the sale of the asset are exempt from capital gains tax or deferral relief of capital gains tax and income tax relief for investments that qualify for certain plans. Deferral relief is available when the investor uses the gains from the sale of another asset to invest in a company that qualifies for two of the government’s venture capital tax relief plans, EIS and SITR. The sale must have occurred one year before, or three years after, the investment in EIS and SITR.20 The tax becomes payable when the investment is disposed of, canceled, redeemed or repaid, the investor becomes nonresident in the UK or the company the investment is in stops meeting the conditions of the plan.21   Both the company and the investor must qualify for the relief in these plans. For companies to qualify they must have a permanent establishment in the UK,22 carry out a qualifying trade that  14 Finance Act 2016, c. 24, § 83, https://perma.cc/26GS-DSSB.  15 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, § 1K. 16 Finance Act 2023, c. 1, § 8, https://perma.cc/ZX69-JDZD.  17 Capital Gains Tax Rates and Allowances, HM Revenue & Customs, supra note 12. 18 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, § 28. 19 Capital Gains Tax Rates and Allowances, HM Revenue & Customs, supra note 12. 20 Tax Relief for Investors Using Venture Capital Schemes, HM Revenue & Customs, supra note 5. 21 Id. 22 Venture Capital Schemes: Permanent Establishment, HM Revenue & Customs (Mar. 30, 2017), https://perma.cc/566K-CD9G.  \fInvestment Incentives: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 183 they intend to spend the investment on,23 not be controlled by any other company, and not be listed on a recognized stock exchange.24   In order to be eligible to receive investment under these plans, the companies must make an “advance assurance request,”25 which shows potential investors that an investment in the company may qualify for one of the tax relief plans. In 2021-22, 73% of applications for advance assurance were approved under the EIS, 72% were approved under the SEIS, and 50% were approved under the SITR.26  Knowledge intensive companies are eligible for more funding through the EIS and VCT than regular companies. A company may apply as a knowledge intensive company if   • the first commercial sale or the first annual turnover of over £200,000 (approximately US$256,695) was less than 10 years ago,  • the proposed investment amount is over the limits of the plan the company wishes to apply for,  • the company meets the conditions of the EIS, and  • the company qualifies as a knowledge intensive company.   To be a knowledge intensive company means that the company and any qualifying subsidiaries must have fewer than 500 full-time, or equivalent, employees when the shares are issued and either   • conduct work to create intellectual property with the expectation that the majority of the business of the company will come from this within a 10-year period, or  • have 20% of employees, who hold a master’s degree or higher, conducting research for at least three years from the date of investment.   At least 10% of the overall operating costs of the business must be spent on research, development or innovation over three years, or 15% in one of three years, either preceding or following the investment.27   23Activities excluded for the purposes of the EIS and SEIS are specified in the Income Tax Act 2007, § 192(1), and §§ 193-199. Excluded activities for the VCT plan are specified in the Income Tax Act 2007, § 303(1) and §§ 304 -310.

Enterprise Investment Scheme  In order to promote the investment in small trading companies, the EIS provides for capital gains deferral relief and EIS disposal relief.28 Capital gains deferral relief means that 100% of the capital gains tax (CGT) will be deferred if the gain from a sale of any asset is used to invest in a company that qualifies for AIS.29 EIS disposal relief means that no capital gains will be charged on the disposal of EIS shares, provided they are held by a qualifying investor for a minimum period of three years and have received income tax relief.30 Income tax relief of 30% of the amount invested up to a maximum of £1 million (approximately US$1.28 million), or £2 million (approximately US$2.57 million) if £1 million of the investment is in knowledge intensive companies, must be claimed in order to receive the CGT relief upon the sale of shares.31   For the investor to qualify for EIS, they must not have   • a connection with the company, meaning they cannot be an employee, partner or director,  • a substantial interest in the issuing company,  • linked loans or related investment arrangements,  • made the investment for tax avoidance purposes, or • more than a 30% stake in the company.  Relief is available for any losses.32  Tax relief for investors in a company under the EIS will be withheld or withdrawn if the company fails to comply with the rules of the plan, summarized below, for at least three years after the investment has been made.33  In order to be a qualifying company for the EIS, the company must carry on one or more trades on a commercial basis with the intention of making a profit and must not include an excluded activity,34 such as dealing in land, shares, securities, or other financial instruments.35 The company  28 Income Tax Act 2007, c. 3, pt. 5. 29 Tax Relief for Investors Using Venture Capital Schemes, HM Revenue & Customs, supra note 5. 30 Apply to Use the Enterprise Investment Scheme to Raise Money for Your Company, HM Revenue & Customs (last updated Jan. 31, 2023), https://perma.cc/C5QY-8X8U.  31 Income Tax Act 2007, c. 3, § 158.

Additionally, its first commercial sale must be less than seven years ago, although this period is longer if the company is a knowledge intensive company.36   The investment must be used for a qualifying trade, research and development that is expected to lead to a qualifying trade, or preparation to carry out a qualifying trade, which must occur within two years of the first investment,37 or the date the company starts trading if this is later. It must be used to develop the business and cannot be used to purchase another business, either in part or in whole. The investment must also “pose a risk of loss to capital for the investor.”38  There are lifetime limits on the amount of investment using EIS a qualifying company can receive. It is currently £20 million (approximately US$25.67 million) for knowledge intensive companies, which are those that undertake research, development or innovation and must have received their first risk investment within either 10 years of their first commercial sale or their first turnover of £200,000 (approximately US$256,470). The lifetime limit for all other companies is £12 million (approximately US$15.2 million), up to a maximum of £5 million (approximately US$6.4 million) in one year, and the first risk investment must be received within the first seven years of their first commercial sale for all other companies,39 with the first risk investment occurring within seven years of their first commercial sale.40   In the financial year 2021-22, 4,480 companies raised £2.3 million (approximately US$2.95 million) of funds under this plan, the highest number since it was introduced.41 Companies in the information and communication sector raised £785 million (approximately US$1 billion) of these funds, accounting for 34% of EIS investment during this time period.42  B.  Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme  SEIS is available for investments in qualifying companies from individuals who   • are not company employees,  • do not have a substantial interest in the company,  • hold the shares for a minimum period of three years,  • pay up front in cash for their shares,   36 Use a Venture Capital Scheme to Raise Money for Your Company, HM Revenue & Customs, supra note 7. 37 Apply to Use the Enterprise Investment Scheme to Raise Money for Your Company, HM Revenue & Customs, supra note 30. 38 Id. 39 Id.  40 Enterprise Investment Scheme, Seed Enterprise Investment Scheme and Social Investment Tax Relief Statistics: 2023, HM Revenue & Customs, supra note 6.  41 Id. 42 Id.  \fInvestment Incentives: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 186 • do not make the investment for tax avoidance purposes, and  • do not have any linked loans or related investment arrangements.43  SEIS has two different types of CGT relief. The first provides for reinvestment relief, which applies where an investor gets SEIS income tax relief and uses all the gains on a disposed investment in a non-SEIS company to invest in an SEIS company.44 In these cases, a 50% CGT relief is available on the investment, up to a maximum of £100,000 (approximately US$128,300).45 Capital gains relief is also available for any gains made from the sale of the SEIS investment, meaning no CGT is payable on gains of up to £200,000 (approximately US$256,750), provided the investment is held for a minimum period of three years and the investor has “received SEIS Income Tax relief in full on the whole of your subscription for the SEIS shares and none of the Income Tax relief must have been withdrawn.”46   If the SEIS investment is sold at a loss, loss relief is available. The loss must be offset against the chargeable gains, taking into account any income tax relief that has been given and not withdrawn.47 Income tax relief is available for investments, with 50% relief available up to a maximum of £200,000 (approximately US$256,750).48   In the financial year 2021-22, the government reported that 2,270 companies raised £205 million (approximately US$256 million) of funds under this plan, the highest number since it was introduced. Companies in the information and communication sector raised £83 million (approximately US$107 million) of these funds, accounting for 40% of SEIS investment during this time period.49  In order to qualify for SEIS, the company or group of companies must be less than two years old and, at the time of investment, have £350,000 (approximately US$449 million) or less in gross assets and fewer than 25 employees. In addition, it must not have carried out a different trade on a previous occasion.50 Companies who have received investments through EIS or a VCT are not eligible for this plan.51   43 Income Tax Act 2007, c. 3, § 257B.  44 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, sch. 5BB.  45 Id.

Social Investment Tax Relief  SITR was available for investments up to April 6, 2023.52 Under this plan, CGT could be deferred (deferral relief) for 50% of the initial investment, up to a maximum of £100,000 (approximately US$128,300) if the investor used the gain from the sale of another asset to invest in the SITR. Any gains made from the sale of the shares was exempt from CGT if the investor received income tax relief.53 Investors could claim income tax relief up to a maximum income tax relief of £1 million (approximately US$1.28 million) for SITR on 30% of the investment.54   In the financial year 2021-22, 40 social enterprises raised £5.4 million (approximately US$6.93 million) in funds under this plan.55  D.  Venture Capital Trust  A VCT is a company that has been approved by His Majesty’s Revenue and Customs to invest in, or lend money to, unlisted companies.56 VCTs must be listed on a recognized stock exchange and, at the time the shares are issued, have fewer than 250 full time equivalent employees (500 for knowledge intensive companies). Before the investment, they must have gross assets of less than £15 million (about US$19.2 million).57 The first risk finance investment must have occurred within seven years of the first commercial sale, or within 10 years for knowledge intensive companies. Companies that qualify under the plan can raise up to £5 million (about US$6.4 million) in a 12-month period, £10 million (about US$12.8 million) for knowledge intensive companies, up to a lifetime limit of £12 million (about US$15.36 million), or £20 million (about US$25.6 million) for knowledge intensive companies.58 Any gains made on the sale of these shares is exempt from CGT.59 Investors may also claim income tax relief of up to £200,000 (approximately US$256,750) annually on 30% of a VCT investment.60   E.

Share Incentive Plan  Employees who receive or purchase shares through the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) are not liable for income tax or national insurance on the value of the shares, provided they keep the shares in the plan for a minimum period of five years.72 When determining the amount of chargeable gains, “the employee is treated for CGT as having acquired the shares for a consideration equal to the market value at the time they exit the [plan].”73   Employees who receive shares from their employer through a Share Incentive Plan and holds the shares in the plan for five years are exempt from CGT. Employees may receive up to 3,600 of shares from their employer in each tax year; the employee may purchase up to £1,800 (approximately US$2,311) of shares, or shares to the value of 10% of the employee’s income, whichever is lower, each year; employers may provide up to two matching shares for each share purchases; and if the plan allows, any dividends paid out from the shares from the above sources may be used to purchase more shares.74  The government announced during the 2023 budget that it intends to launch a call for evidence on this plan and will review options to simplify and clarify it.75  B.  Enterprise Management Incentives  Enterprise Management Incentives (EMIs) are available to employees of small, high risk, companies that have assets of £30 million (approximately US$39 million) or less.76 Employees who do not have a material interest in the company (i.e., are beneficial owners or have control of more than 30% of the shares in the company) and who work at least 25 hours a week, or if less,  70 United Kingdom, Individual Taxation, IBFD, ¶ 1.2.3, supra note 62. 71 Id. 72 Id. 73 Id. referring to Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, c. 1, §§ 488-515 and sch. 2, https://perma.cc/SA45-UH2B. 74 Tax and Employee Share Schemes, Gov.uk, https://perma.cc/4NUM-A8N6.  75 Spring Budget 2023, HM Treasury (Mar. 21, 2023), https://perma.cc/BV3P-VH9T.  76 Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003, c. 1, sch. 5, https://perma.cc/3XFP-EVV5; Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, sch. 7D pt. 4.

Any shares provided to an employee under a company share option plan (CSOP) are taken into account when determining whether the employee has reached the individual limit. Companies may provide options under the EMI plan up to a maximum of £3 million (approximately US$3.85 million). Any shares issued in excess of this amount are not afforded beneficial tax treatment.77  When an option for an EMI is granted, no income tax or national insurance contributions are charged. There do not appear to be any exemptions for CGT.78   Companies operating in certain areas are excluded from participating in EMI, and these include farming, banking, property development, legal services, and shipbuilding.79   V.  Business/Corporate Incentives  There is no net worth tax on businesses in the UK.80 The disposal of capital gains of a company are subject to corporation tax, which is chargeable at the main rate of 25% for companies with profits over £250,000 (approximately US$320,930) and the small profits rate of 19% for companies with profits under £50,000 (approximately US$64,190).81 Relief is provided for trading companies, or companies within a trading group, that dispose of at least 10% of a shareholding in a qualifying company that has been held for a 12-month period. Any gains on the disposal of these assets are exempt from corporation tax.82   A.  Business Asset Disposal Relief   Business Asset Disposal Relief (formerly Entrepreneurs’ Relief) applies to individuals who make “qualifying business disposals” of companies they own.83 Such disposals are the “material disposal of business assets, a disposal of trust business assets or the disposal associated with a relevant material disposal.”84 This can be any part or whole of a business that has been owned by the individual as a sole trader or business partner claiming the relief for a minimum period of two years prior to the disposal. The disposal of shares of a “personal company” also falls into this  77 United Kingdom, Individual Taxation, IBFD, ¶ 1.3.5.1, supra note 62. 78 HM Revenue & Customs, HMRC Internal Manual, Capital Gains Manual: CG56440 - Enterprise Management Incentives (EMI): Introduction, supra note 76. 79 United Kingdom, Individual Taxation, IBFD, ¶ 1.3.5.1, supra note 62. 80 United Kingdom, Corporate Taxation, Country Tax Guides, 1.

There is a £1 million (approximately US$1.28 million) limit to this relief and any gains over this amount are charged 20%.87  The disposal of an individual’s personal assets that have been used in their trade or business may also give rise to business asset disposal relief “if the disposal is associated with a partial or full withdrawal by the individual from that trade or business.” This is known as the “associated disposal rule.”88 The withdrawal must be a minimum of 5% of the individual’s shareholding in the company.89  B.  Business Asset Rollover Relief   If a business disposes of an asset it used in its business and uses all, or part, of the proceeds from the sale to purchase a new asset, which will also be used in its business, it may be able to delay the charge to capital gains until the sale of the new asset.90 In order to qualify for deferral, the purchase of new assets must have occurred 12 months before, or within three years after, the disposal date of the old one.91  C.  Incorporation Relief  Sole traders or business partnerships that transfer their business and all the assets in return for shares in the company may qualify for incorporation relief.92 This relief means that CGT will be deferred until the individuals dispose of the shares.93      85 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, § 165A. 86 Id. § 169I and United Kingdom, Individual Taxation, IBFD, ¶ 1.7, supra note 62.  87 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, § 169N.

Gift Hold-Over Relief  Sole traders, business partners, or individuals with a minimum of 5% of voting rights in a company (known as a personal company) that have used assets in the business or company and gift them may be eligible for gift hold-over relief.94 This means that the individual gifting the assets does not have to pay CGT,95 and those in receipt of the gift will only have to pay CGT upon the disposal of the assets.96  The gifting of shares only qualifies for gift hold-over relief if the company’s main activity is trading, e.g., the provision of goods and services, and the shares are not listed on a recognized stock exchange or from a personal company.97  VI.  Tax Treaties   Foreign tax exemptions for nonresident investors are handled in certain tax treaties to ensure that tax exemptions granted in some countries are not rendered useless by the taxes in the other country to the treaty. Some tax treaties the UK has include provisions that   grant a fixed foreign tax credit on certain categories of foreign income, even if such income is exempt from foreign tax or subject only to a low level of taxation under the law of the source country. Section 20 of the Taxation (International and Other Provisions) Act 2010 provides that foreign tax includes any tax that would have been payable but for a relief given under the law of the foreign territory with a view to promoting industrial, commercial, scientific, educational or other development in a territory outside the United Kingdom, and about which provision is made in a double tax treaty.98    94 Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992, c. 12, §§ 12, 165-167, and sch. 7.

In addition, under the federal income tax system, capital gains are not subject to taxation until “realized,”—that is, until the taxpayer has sold the capital asset. If the capital asset has increased in value, this gain is not subject to tax until realized. The realization requirement allows taxpayers not only to have some control over the timing of the assets’ income taxation but also to receive the benefit of the assets’ built-in gain without triggering a taxable event. With regard to corporations, although capital gains are not taxed at a preferential rate compared to a corporation’s ordinary income, there are other tax advantages for holding capital assets, including the funding of certain types of employee stock-option retirement plans.   I.  Individual Income Tax  A. Preferential Rates on Capital Gains  In general, gain or loss reflected in the value of an asset is not recognized for income tax purposes until a taxpayer disposes of the asset. On the sale or exchange of a capital asset, any gain generally is included in income. This “realization requirement” gives the taxpayer some control over the time when the capital gains will be subject to tax.  This is in contrast to a “mark to market” system, in which unrealized capital gains are taxed annually, and then that gain is added to the assets’ basis for computing future gain.1  B. Net Capital Gains Subject to Income Tax  Capital losses are generally deductible in full against capital gains. In addition, individual taxpayers may deduct capital losses against up to $3,000 of ordinary income each year.2 Any remaining unused capital losses may be carried forward indefinitely to another taxable year.    1 Jane G. Gravelle, Cong. Rsch. Serv., IF11957, Mark-to-Market Taxation of Capital Gains (Mar. 29, 2022), https://perma.cc/X74C-HKE2. 2 26 U.S.C. [hereinafter I.R.C.] § 1211(b). \fInvestment Incentives: United States The Law Library of Congress 194 C. Capital Gains Compared to Ordinary Income Rates  Ordinary income marginal tax rates are as follows for single individuals.3 These rates also apply to capital gains from the sale of capital assets held less than one year (i.e., “short-term capital gains”).  Taxable Income Ordinary Income Marginal Tax Rate Not over $11,000 10% of the taxable income $11,001 to $44,725 12% of the excess over $11,000 $44,726 to $95,375 22% of the excess over $44,725 $95,376 to $182,100 24% of the excess over $95,375 $182,101 to $231,250 32% of the excess over $182,100 $231,251 to $578,125 35% of the excess over $231,250 Over $578,125 37% of the excess over $578,125  The following are net capital gain rates for 2023 for single individuals, which apply to capital gains from assets held for more than one year (i.e., “long-term capital gains”):  Taxable Income Net Capital Gain Tax Rate $0 to $44,625 0% $44,626 to $492,300 15% Over $492,300 20%  Certain high-income taxpayers with incomes over a threshold ($200,000 for individuals) are required to pay an additional 3.8% net investment income tax.4 Thus, for these individuals, the net capital gain rate may be as high as 23.8%.  As noted above, net capital gain tax rates are significantly lower than the corresponding ordinary income marginal tax rates for a similar level of taxable income.  D. Special Rules for Certain Capital Gains  There are special rules for particular types of capital gains.5  • Gains from depreciation of assets are subject to ordinary rates, but gains arising from depreciation of real property are subject to a 25% ceiling. • Gains on collectibles are taxed at 28%. • Gains from a primary-residence home sale have an exclusion of $500,000 for a married couple and $250,000 for an individual.  3 I.R.C. § 1; Joint Comm. on Taxation, Overview of the Federal Tax System as in Effect for 2023, JCX-9R-23 (May 11, 2023), https://perma.cc/XJM4-JRAZ. 4 I.R.C. § 1411. 5 Gravelle, supra note 1. \fInvestment Incentives: United States The Law Library of Congress 195 • In like-kind exchanges6 the taxpayer can exchange one asset (generally real estate) for another parcel of real estate without triggering a realization event.  E. Enjoyment of Gains Without Paying Tax  A taxpayer can enjoy the capital gains without realizing the gains for tax purposes by using the asset’s appreciation as collateral for a loan. Borrowing is not a taxable event, and money received from a personal loan is not income, so long as there is an obligation to repay.7  F. Carried Interest  Hedge fund managers typically receive two types of compensation for managing a hedge fund: a management fee equal to 2% of the invested assets plus a 20% share of the profits as “carried interest.”8  With this compensation schedule, only the 2% management fee is considered to be ordinary income under the Internal Revenue Code, and the 20% carried interest profit share is treated as capital gains.9 The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (Public Law 115-97) lengthened from one to three years the period for which an investment fund is required to hold assets for the carried interest to be taxed as a long-term capital gain.10  II.  Corporate Taxation  A. Capital Gains Taxation for Corporations  Unlike individuals who have a graduated tax rate structure, corporations have a flat income tax, currently set at 21%.11 In addition, corporations do not have a separate rate structure for capital gains, and cannot deduct the amount of capital losses in excess of capital gains for any taxable year.12  As with all other taxpayers, a corporation’s capital gains are not taxed until realized.    6 I.R.C. § 1031. 7 See United States v. Kirby Lumber Co., 284 U.S. 1 (1931), https://perma.cc/7F98-WZBH. 8 Donald J. Marples, Cong. Rsch.

Funding Retirement Plans with the Corporation’s Stock  The tax code provides some incentives for a corporation to provide its employees with an employee stock option plan (ESOP) as part of its deferred compensation package.13  Certain benefits are available to ESOPs that are not available to other types of qualified retirement plans that hold employer stock. Under an exception to the prohibited transaction rules, an employer maintaining an ESOP may lend money to the ESOP, or the employer may guarantee a loan made by a third-party lender to the ESOP, to finance the ESOP’s purchase of employer securities.14 An ESOP that borrows funds to acquire employer securities is generally called a leveraged ESOP. In the case of an ESOP maintained by a C corporation,15 payments of principal on the ESOP loan are deductible to the extent permitted under the general deduction limits for contributions to qualified retirement plans (which generally limit the deduction for contribution to a defined contribution plan for a year to 25% of the participant’s compensation), and interest payments are deductible without regard to the limitation.16 In addition, a C corporation may deduct dividends paid on employer stock held by an ESOP if the dividends are used to repay a loan, if they are distributed to plan participants, or if the plan gives participants the opportunity to elect either to receive the dividends or to have them reinvested in employer stock under the ESOP, and the dividends are reinvested at the participants’ election.17 This deduction is also allowed without regard to the general deduction limits on contributions to qualified plans. Moreover, subject to certain requirements, a taxpayer may elect to defer the recognition of long-term capital gain on the sale of qualified securities to an ESOP maintained by a C corporation.18  C. Real Estate Like-Kind Exchanges  There is an important tax distinction between real property and other forms of investments: an ability to trade it for a similar property via a tax-free like-kind exchange.19  Like-kind exchanges, which are exchanges of real property used for business or held as an investment solely for other business or investment property that is the same type or “like-kind,” have long been permitted under the Internal Revenue Code.20 Generally, if a taxpayer makes a like-kind exchange, they are not required to recognize a gain or loss. If, as part of the exchange,  13 Joint Comm. on Taxation, JCX-32-21, Present Law and Background relating to Retirement Plans (July 26, 2021), https://perma.cc/7S2C-PJ83. 14 I.R.C. § 4975(d)(3). 15 C corporations, also known as ordinary corporations, are named for Subchapter C of the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), which details their tax treatment. See Mark P. Keightley, Cong. Rsch. Serv., R43104, A Brief Overview of Business Types and Their Tax Treatment (Dec. 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/W9NU-V4AM. 16 I.R.C. § 404(a)(9). 17 I.R.C. § 404(k). 18 I.R.C. § 1042. 19 Internal Revenue Serv., Like-Kind Exchanges – Real Estate Tax Tips (Mar. 2, 2023), https://perma.cc/GG53-UXDH. 20 I.R.C. § 1031. \fInvestment Incentives: United States The Law Library of Congress 197 the taxpayer also receives other (not like-kind) property or money, they must recognize a gain from the other property and money received. The taxpayer cannot recognize a loss incurred from a like-kind exchange.  Section 1031 of the code applies only to exchanges of real property and not to exchanges of personal or intangible property. An exchange of real property held primarily for sale does not qualify as a like-kind exchange. \f The Law Library of Congress 198 Table of Primary Sources  Jurisdiction  Type of Law Citation Link Australia  Statute  Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 (Cth)  https://perma.cc/9FNH-VTKS Income Tax Assessment Act 1997 (Cth)  https://perma.cc/X47H-W4L8 Brazil Statute Lei No. 6.404, de 15 de Dezembro de 1976 https://perma.cc/JHH9-KPP8 Lei No. 8.668, de 25 de Junho de 1993 https://perma.cc/5S5G-99H7 Lei No. 8.981, de 20 de Janeiro de 1995, as amended by Lei No. 13.259, de 16 de Março de 2016 https://perma.cc/5Z8Q-NYNM Lei No. 9.249, de 26 de Dezembro de 1995 https://perma.cc/HHB4-HYF7 Lei No. 11.033, de 21 de Dezembro de 2004 https://perma.cc/FGK5-JH4W  Lei No. 13.043, de 13 de Novembro de 2014 https://perma.cc/BD3Q-6D3F Lei No. 13.259, de 16 de Março de 2016 https://perma.cc/2P3N-CMRR Legislative Decree Decreto-Lei No. 288, de 28 de Fevereiro de 1967 https://perma.cc/AQ5L-T48R Decreto-Lei No. 1.598, de 26 de Dezembro de 1977 https://perma.cc/H5BC-WVTV Decree Decreto No. 9.580, de 22 de Novembro de 2018, art. 2 https://perma.cc/T29L-HXKB Resolution Resolução BCB No. 278, de 31 de Dezembro de 2022 https://perma.cc/T2VT-8NHM \fInvestment Incentives: Table of Primary Sources  The Law Library of Congress 199 Jurisdiction  Type of Law Citation Link Canada Statute Income Tax Act, R.S.C., 1985, c. 1 (5th Supp.) https://perma.cc/JU6G-3GEM China Statute Enterprise Income Tax Law  https://perma.cc/JRR8-P9WS Individual Income Tax Law https://perma.cc/3XBT-F27X Law on Hainan Free Trade Port https://perma.cc/T2NE-TANA  Egypt Statute Law No. 83 of 2002, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 22 bis, June 5, 2002 https://perma.cc/D6YL-Q3MF  Law No. 91 of 2005, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 23 (annex), June 9, 2005   https://perma.cc/SY2A-T83V Law No. 67 of 2016, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 35 Duplicate (C), Sept. 7, 2016 https://perma.cc/U7TY-998S Law No. 72 of 2017, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 21 (duplicate) (c), May 31, 2017 https://perma.cc/33DS-S9AR Law No. 199 of 2020, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 39 duplicate, Sept. 30, 2020 https://perma.cc/A66U-CQ29 Law No. 26 of 2020, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 19 annex, May 7, 2020 https://perma.cc/WF34-KY6P Law No. 3 of 2022, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 3 Duplicate (h), Jan. 26, 2022 https://perma.cc/Y8PQ-946H France Statute General Tax Law https://perma.cc/U3AT-6B9M  Labor Code https://perma.cc/R5TM-2LRD Law No. 2022-1726 of Dec. 30, 2022 https://perma.cc/EHR4-HNMP  Social Security Code https://perma.cc/7ZT7-CNFJ \fInvestment Incentives: Table of Primary Sources  The Law Library of Congress 200 Jurisdiction  Type of Law Citation Link Decree Decree 2022-968 of June 30, 2022 https://perma.cc/4YXR-A4SV Germany Constitution Grundgesetz [GG], May 23, 1949, BGBl.

Wedemonstrate the effectiveness of our ap-proaches on 4 public datasets from Se-mEval 2014, 2015, and 2016, and weshow that attention-based LSTM beneﬁtsfrom document-level knowledge in multi-ple ways.1IntroductionGiven a sentence and an opinion target (also calledan aspect term) occurring in the sentence, aspect-level sentiment classiﬁcation aims to determinethe sentiment polarity in the sentence towards theopinion target. An opinion target or target for shortrefers to a word or a phrase describing an aspect ofan entity. For example, in the sentence “This littleplace has a cute interior decor but the prices arequite expensive”, the targets are interior decor andprices, and they are associated with positive andnegative sentiment respectively.A sentence may contain multiple sentiment-target pairs, thus one challenge is to separatedifferent opinion contexts for different targets.For this purpose, state-of-the-art neural meth-ods (Wang et al., 2016; Liu and Zhang, 2017; Chenet al., 2017) adopt attention-based LSTM net-works, where the LSTM aims to capture sequen-tial patterns and the attention mechanism aimsto emphasize target-speciﬁc contexts for encod-ing sentence representations. Typically, LSTMsonly show their potential when trained on largedatasets. However, aspect-level training data re-quires the annotation of all opinion targets in asentence, which is costly to obtain in practice. Assuch, existing public aspect-level datasets are allrelatively small. Insufﬁcient training data limitsthe effectiveness of neural models.Despite the lack of aspect-level labeled data,enormous document-level labeled data are eas-ily accessible online such as Amazon reviews.These reviews contain substantial linguistic pat-terns and come with sentiment labels naturally.In this paper, we hypothesize that aspect-levelsentiment classiﬁcation can be improved by em-ploying knowledge gained from document-levelsentiment classiﬁcation.Speciﬁcally, we ex-plore two transfer methods to incorporate thissort of knowledge – pretraining and multi-tasklearning.In our experiments, we ﬁnd thatboth methods are helpful and combining themachieves signiﬁcant improvements over attention-based LSTM models trained only on aspect-leveldata.We also illustrate by examples that ad-ditional knowledge from document-level data isbeneﬁcial in multiple ways.Our source codecan be obtained from https://github.com/ruidan/Aspect-level-sentiment.2Related WorkVarious neural models (Dong et al., 2014; Nguyenand Shirai, 2015; Vo and Zhang, 2015; Tang et al.,2016a,b; Wang et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2016;Liu and Zhang, 2017; Chen et al., 2017) have beenproposed for aspect-level sentiment classiﬁcation.The main idea behind these works is to developneural architectures that are able to learn continu-ous features and capture the intricate relation be-tween a target and context words. However, tosufﬁciently train these models, substantial aspect-\f580level annotated data is required, which is expen-sive to obtain in practice.We explore both pretraining and multi-tasklearning for transferring knowledge from docu-ment level to aspect level.Both methods arewidely studied in the literature. Pretraining is acommon technique used in computer vision wherelow-level neural layers can be usefully transferredto different tasks (Krizhevsky and Sutskever,2012; Zeiler and Fergus, 2014). In natural lan-guage processing (NLP), some efforts have beeninitiated on pretraining LSTMs (Dai and Le, 2015;Zoph et al., 2016; Ramachandran et al., 2017)for sequence-to-sequence models in both super-vised and unsupervised settings, where promisingresults have been obtained. On the other hand,multi-task learning simultaneously trains on sam-ples in multiple tasks with a combined objec-tive (Collobert and Weston, 2008; Luong et al.,2015a; Liu et al., 2016), which has improvedmodel generalization ability in certain cases. Inthe work of Mou et al. (2016), the authors investi-gated the transferability of neural models in NLPapplications with extensive experiments, showingthat transferability largely depends on the seman-tic relatedness of the source and target tasks. Forour problem, we hypothesize that aspect-level sen-timent classiﬁcation can be improved by employ-ing knowledge gained from document-level senti-ment classiﬁcation, as these two tasks are highlyrelated semantically.3Models3.1Attention-based LSTMWe ﬁrst describe a conventional implementationof an attention-based LSTM model for this task.We use it as a baseline model and extend it withpretraining and multi-task learning approaches forincorporating document-level knowledge.The inputs are a sentence s = (w1, w2, ..., wn)consisting of n words, and an opinion target x =(x1, x2, ..., xm) occurring in the sentence consist-ing of a subsequence of m words from s. Eachword is associated with a continuous word embed-ding ew (Mikolov et al., 2013) from an embeddingmatrix E ∈RV ×d, where V is the vocabulary sizeand d is the embedding dimension.LSTM is used to capture sequential informa-tion, and outputs a sequence of hidden vectors:[h1, ..., hn] = LSTM([ew1, ..., ewn], θlstm)(1)An attention layer assigns a weight αi to eachword in the sentence. The ﬁnal target-speciﬁc rep-resentation of the sentence s is then given by:z =nXi=1αihi(2)And αi is computed as follows:αi =exp(βi)Pnj=1 exp(βj)(3)βi = fscore(hi, t) = tanh(hTi Wat)(4)t = 1mmXi=1exi(5)where t is the target representation computed asthe averaged word embedding of the target. fscoreis a content-based function that captures the se-mantic association between a word and the target,for which we adopt the formulation used in (Lu-ong et al., 2015b; He et al., 2017) with parametermatrix Wa ∈Rd×d.The sentence representation z is fed into an out-put layer to predict the probability distribution pover sentiment labels on the target:p = softmax(Woz + bo)(6)We refer to this baseline model as LSTM+ATT. Itis trained via cross entropy minimization:J = −Xi∈Dlog pi(ci)(7)where D denotes the overall training corpus, ci de-notes the true label for sample i, and pi(ci) de-notes the probability of the true label.3.2Transfer ApproachesLSTM+ATTisusedasouraspect-levelmodelwithparametersetθaspect={E, θlstm, Wa, Wo, bo}.WealsobuildastandardLSTM-basedclassiﬁerbasedondocument-level training examples. This networkis the same as the LSTM+ATT apart from thelack of the attention layer.The training ob-jective is also cross entropy minimization asshown in equation (7) and the parameter set isθdoc = {E′, θ′lstm, W′o, b′o}.Pretraining (PRET): In this setting, we ﬁrst trainon document-level examples. The last hidden vec-tor from the LSTM outputs is used as the doc-ument representation. We initialize the relevant\f581DatasetPosNegNeuD1Restaurant14-Train2164807637Restaurant14-Test728196196D2Laptop14-Train994870464Laptop14-Test341128169D3Restaurant15-Train117838250Restaurant15-Test43932835D4Restaurant16-Train162070988Restaurant16-Test59719038Table 1: Dataset description.parameters E, θlstm, Wo, bo of LSTM+ATT withthe pretrained weights, and train it on aspect-levelexamples to ﬁne tune those weights and learn Wawhich is randomly initialized.Multi-task Learning (MULT): This approach si-multaneously trains two tasks – document-leveland aspect-level classiﬁcation. In this setting, theembedding layer (E) and the LSTM layer (θlstm)are shared by both tasks, and a document is rep-resented as the mean vector over LSTM outputs.The other parameters are task-speciﬁc. The over-all loss function is then given by:L = J + λU(8)where U is the loss function of document-levelclassiﬁcation. λ ∈(0, 1) is a hyperparameter thatcontrols the weight of U.Combined (PRET+MULT): In this setting, weﬁrst perform PRET on document-level exam-ples. We use the pretrained weights for parame-ter initialization for both aspect-level model anddocument-level model, and then perform MULTas discussed above.4Experiments4.1Datasets and Experimental SettingsWe run experiments on four benchmark aspect-level datasets, taken from SemEval 2014 (Pontikiet al., 2014), SemEval 2015 (Pontiki et al., 2015),and SemEval 2016 (Pontiki et al., 2016).Fol-lowing previous work (Tang et al., 2016b; Wanget al., 2016), we remove samples with conﬂictingpolarities in all datasets1. Statistics of the resultingdatasets are presented in Table 1.We derived two document-level datasets fromYelp2014 (Tang et al., 2015) and the AmazonElectronics dataset (McAuley et al., 2015) respec-tively. The original reviews were rated on a 5-point scale. We consider 3-class classiﬁcation and1We remove samples in the 2015/6 datasets if an opiniontarget is associated with different sentiment polarities.thus label reviews with rating < 3, > 3, and = 3 asnegative, positive, and neutral respectively. Eachsampled dataset contains 30k instances with ex-actly balanced class labels. We pair up an aspect-level dataset and a document-level dataset whenthey are from a similar domain – the Yelp datasetis used by D1, D3, and D4 for PRET and MULT,and the Electronics dataset is only used by D2.In all experiments, 300-dimension GloVe vec-tors (Pennington et al., 2014) are used to initializeE and E′ when pretraining is not conducted forweight initialization. These vectors are also usedfor initializing E′ in the pretraining phase. Val-ues for hyperparameters are obtained from experi-ments on development sets. We randomly sample20% of the original training data from the aspect-level dataset as the development set and only usethe remaining 80% for training. For all experi-ments, the dimension of LSTM hidden vectors isset to 300, λ is set to 0.1, and we use dropout withprobability 0.5 on sentence/document representa-tions before the output layer. We use RMSPropas the optimizer with the decay rate set to 0.9 andthe base learning rate set to 0.001. The mini-batchsize is set to 32.4.2Model ComparisonTable 2 shows the results of LSTM, LSTM+ATT,PRET, MULT, PRET+MULT, and four representa-tive prior works (Tang et al., 2016a,b; Wang et al.,2016; Chen et al., 2017). Signiﬁcance tests areconducted for testing the robustness of methodsunder random parameter initialization. Both accu-racy and macro-F1 are used for evaluation as labeldistribution is unbalanced. The reported numbersare obtained as the average value over 5 runs withrandom initialization for each method.We observe that PRET is very helpful, and con-sistently gives a 1–3% increase in accuracy overLSTM+ATT across all datasets.The improve-ments in macro-F1 scores are even more, espe-cially on D3 and D4 where the labels are ex-tremely unbalanced. MULT gives similar perfor-mance as LSTM+ATT on D1 and D2, but im-provements can be clearly observed for D3 andD4.The combination (PRET+MULT) overallyields better results.There are two main reasons why the improve-ments of macro-F1 scores are more signiﬁcant onD3 and D4 than on D1: (1) D1 has much moreneutral examples in the training set.

Averaged results over 5 runs are reported.without any external knowledge might still be ableto learn some neutral-related features on D1 but itis very hard to learn from D3 and D4. (2) Thenumbers of neutral examples in the test sets ofD3 and D4 are very small. Thus, the precisionand recall on neutral class will be largely affectedby even a small prediction difference (e.g., with 5more neutral examples correctly identiﬁed, recallis increased by more than 10% on both datasets).As a result, the macro-F1 scores on D3 and D4 areaffected more.4.3Ablation TestsTable 2 indicates that a large percentage of the per-formance gain comes from PRET. To better un-derstand the transfer effects of different layers –embedding layer (E), LSTM layer (θlstm), andoutput layer (Wo, bo) – we conduct ablation testson PRET with different layers transfered from thedocument-level model to the aspect-level model.Results are presented in Table 3. “LSTM only”denotes the setting where only the LSTM layer istransferred, and “Without LSTM” denotes the set-ting where only the embedding and output layersare transferred (excluding the LSTM layer). Thekey observations are: (1) Transfer is helpful inall settings. Improvements over LSTM+ATT areobserved even when only one layer is transferred.(2) Overall, transfers of the LSTM and embeddinglayer are more useful than the output layer. Thisis what we expect, since the output layer is nor-mally more task-speciﬁc. (3) Transfer of the em-bedding layer is more helpful on D3 and D4. Onepossible explanation is that the label distribution isextremely unbalanced on these two datasets. Sen-timent information is not adequately captured byGloVe word embeddings. Therefore, with a smallnumber of training examples in the negative andneutral classes, the embeddings trained by aspect-level classiﬁcation still do not effectively capturethe true semantics of the relevant opinion words.Transfer of the embedding layer can greatly helpin this case.4.4AnalysisTo show that aspect-level classiﬁcation indeedbeneﬁts from document-level knowledge,weconduct experiments to vary the percentage ofdocument-level training examples from 0.0 to 1.0for PRET+MULT. The changes of accuracies andmacro-F1 scores on the four datasets are shown inFigure 1. The improvements on accuracies withincreasing number of document examples are sta-ble across all datasets. For macro-F1 scores, theimprovements on D1 and D2 are stable. We ob-serve sharp increases in the macro-F1 scores ofD3 and D4 when changing the percentage from0 to 0.4. This may be related to their extremely\f58300.20.40.60.816570758085D1D2D3D4Percentage of document-level training examplesAccuracy (%)00.20.40.60.81606264666870D1D2D3D4Percentage of document-level training examplesMacro-F1 (%)Figure 1: Results of PRET+MULT vs. percentageof document-level training data.unbalanced label distribution. In such cases, withthe knowledge gained from a small number of bal-anced document-level examples, aspect-level pre-dictions on neutral examples can be signiﬁcantlyimproved.To better understand in which conditions theproposed method is helpful, we analyze a sub-set of test examples that are correctly classi-ﬁed by PRET+MULT but are misclassiﬁed byLSTM+ATT. We ﬁnd that the beneﬁts brought bydocument-level knowledge are typically shown infour ways.First of all, to our surprise, LSTM+ATT madeobvious mistakes on some instances with commonopinion words. Below are two examples where thetarget is enclosed in [] with its true sentiment indi-cated in the subscript:1. “I was highly disappointed in the [food]neg.”2. “This particular location certainly uses sub-standard [meats]neg.”In the above examples, LSTM+ATT does attendto the right opinion words, but makes the wrongpredictions. One possible reason is that the wordembeddings from GloVe without PRET do noteffectively capture sentiment information, whilethe aspect-level training samples are not sufﬁcientto capture that for certain words. PRET+MULTeliminates this kind of errors.Another ﬁnding is that our method helps tobetter capture domain-speciﬁc opinion words dueto additional knowledge from documents that arefrom a similar domain:1. “The smaller [size]pos was a bonus becauseof space restrictions.”2. “The [price]pos is 200 dollars down.”LSTM+ATT attends on smaller correctly for theﬁrst example but makes the wrong prediction assmaller can be negative in many cases. It does noteven capture down in the second example.Thirdly, we ﬁnd that LSTM+ATT made a num-ber of errors on sentences with negation words:1. I have experienced no problems, [works]posas anticipated.2. [Service]neg not the friendliest to our party!LSTMs typically only show their potential onlarge datasets. Without sufﬁcient training exam-ples, it may not be able to effectively capturevarious sequential patterns. Pretraining the net-work on larger document-level corpus addressesthis problem.Lastly, PRET+MULT makes fewer errors onrecognizing neutral instances. This can also be ob-served from the macro-F1 scores in Table 2. Thelack of training examples makes the predictionof neutral instances very difﬁcult for all previousmethods. Knowledge from document-level exam-ples with balanced labels compensates for this dis-advantage.5ConclusionThe effectiveness of existing aspect-level neuralmodels is limited due to the difﬁculties in obtain-ing training data in practice. Our work is the ﬁrstattempt to incorporate knowledge from document-level corpus for training aspect-level sentimentclassiﬁers. We have demonstrated the effective-ness of our proposed approaches and analyzed themajor beneﬁts brought by the knowledge transfer.The proposed approaches can be potentially in-tegrated with other aspect-level neural models tofurther boost their performance.ReferencesPeng Chen, Zhongqian Sun, Lidong Bing, and WeiYang. 2017.

To capture common sensebeyond associations, we extract from CON-CEPTNET (Speer et al., 2017) multiple targetconcepts that have the same semantic relationto a single source concept.Crowd-workersare asked to author multiple-choice questionsthat mention the source concept and discrim-inate in turn between each of the target con-cepts. This encourages workers to create ques-tions with complex semantics that often re-quire prior knowledge. We create 12,247 ques-tions through this procedure and demonstratethe difﬁculty of our task with a large numberof strong baselines. Our best baseline is basedon BERT-large (Devlin et al., 2018) and ob-tains 56% accuracy, well below human perfor-mance, which is 89%.1IntroductionWhen humans answer questions, they capitalizeon their common sense and background knowl-edge about spatial relations, causes and effects,scientiﬁc facts and social conventions.For in-stance, given the question “Where was Simonwhen he heard the lawn mower?”, one can inferthat the lawn mower is close to Simon, and thatit is probably outdoors and situated at street level.This type of knowledge seems trivial for humans,but is still out of the reach of current natural lan-guage understanding (NLU) systems.∗The authors contributed equallyriverwaterfallbridgevalleya) Sample ConceptNet for speciﬁc subgraphsb) Crowd source corresponding natural language questions and two additional distractorsWhere on a river can you hold a cup upright to catch water on a sunny day?✔‍ waterfall,   ✘bridge,   ✘valley,✘pebble,✘mountainWhere can I stand on a river to see water falling without getting wet? ✘waterfall,   ✔bridge,   ✘valley,✘stream,✘bottomAtLocationI’m crossing the river, my feet are wet but my body is dry, where am I? ✘waterfall,   ✘bridge,   ✔valley,✘bank,✘islandpebblestreambankAtLocationAtLocationcanyonAtLocationAtLocationAtLocationAtLocation…Figure 1: (a) A source concept (‘river’) and three tar-get concepts (dashed) are sampled from CONCEPT-NET (b) Crowd-workers generate three questions, eachhaving one of the target concepts for its answer (\u0013),while the other two targets are not (\u0017). Then, for eachquestion, workers choose an additional distractor fromCONCEPTNET (in italics), and author one themselves(in bold).Work on Question Answering (QA) has mostlyfocused on answering factoid questions, where theanswer can be found in a given context with lit-tle need for commonsense knowledge (Hermannet al., 2015; Rajpurkar et al., 2016; Nguyen et al.,2016; Joshi et al., 2017). Small benchmarks suchas the Winograd Scheme Challenge (Levesque,2011) and COPA (Roemmele et al., 2011), tar-geted common sense more directly, but have beendifﬁcult to collect at scale.Recently, efforts have been invested in devel-oping large-scale datasets for commonsense rea-soning. In SWAG (Zellers et al., 2018b), givena textual description of an event, a probable sub-sequent event needs to be inferred. However, it\f4150has been quickly realized that models trained onlarge amounts of unlabeled data (Devlin et al.,2018) capture well this type of information andperformance on SWAG is already at human level.VCR (Zellers et al., 2018a) is another very re-cent attempt that focuses on the visual aspects ofcommon sense. Such new attempts highlight thebreadth of commonsense phenomena, and make itevident that research on common sense has onlyscratched the surface.Thus, there is need fordatasets and models that will further our under-standing of what is captured by current NLU mod-els, and what are the main lacunae.In this work, we present COMMONSENSEQA,a new dataset focusing on commonsense ques-tion answering, based on knowledge encoded inCONCEPTNET (Speer et al., 2017). We propose amethod for generating commonsense questions atscale by asking crowd workers to author questionsthat describe the relation between concepts fromCONCEPTNET (Figure 1). A crowd worker ob-serves a source concept (‘River’ in Figure 1) andthree target concepts (‘Waterfall’, ‘Bridge’, ‘Val-ley’) that are all related by the same CONCEPT-NET relation (AtLocation). The worker thenauthors three questions, one per target concept,such that only that particular target concept is theanswer, while the other two distractor concepts arenot. This primes the workers to add commonsenseknowledge to the question, that separates the tar-get concept from the distractors. Finally, for eachquestion, the worker chooses one additional dis-tractor from CONCEPTNET, and authors anotherdistractor manually. Thus, in total, ﬁve candidateanswers accompany each question.Because questions are generated freely byworkers, they often require background knowl-edge that is trivial to humans but is seldom explic-itly reported on the web due to reporting bias (Gor-don and Van Durme, 2013). Thus, questions inCOMMONSENSEQA have a different nature com-pared to prior QA benchmarks, where questionsare authored given an input text.Using our method, we collected 12,247 com-monsense questions. We present an analysis thatillustrates the uniqueness of the gathered ques-tions compared to prior work, and the types ofcommonsense skills that are required for tacklingit. We extensively evaluate models on COMMON-SENSEQA, experimenting with pre-trained mod-els, ﬁne-tuned models, and reading comprehen-sion (RC) models that utilize web snippets ex-tracted from Google search on top of the ques-tion itself. We ﬁnd that ﬁne-tuning BERT-LARGE(Devlin et al., 2018) on COMMONSENSEQA ob-tains the best performance, reaching an accuracyof 55.9%. This is substantially lower than humanperformance, which is 88.9%.To summarize, our contributions are:1. A new QA dataset centered around commonsense, containing 12,247 examples.2. A new method for generating commonsensequestions at scale from CONCEPTNET.3. An empirical evaluation of state-of-the-artNLU models on COMMONSENSEQA, show-ing that humans substantially outperform cur-rent models.The dataset can be downloaded from www.tau-nlp.org/commonsenseqa.The codefor all our baselines is available at github.com/jonathanherzig/commonsenseqa.2Related WorkMachine common sense, or the knowledge of andability to reason about an open ended world, haslong been acknowledged as a critical componentfor natural language understanding. Early worksought programs that could reason about an envi-ronment in natural language (McCarthy, 1959), orleverage a world-model for deeper language un-derstanding (Winograd, 1972).Many common-sense representations and inference procedureshave been explored (McCarthy and Hayes, 1969;Kowalski and Sergot, 1986) and large-scale com-monsense knowledge-bases have been developed(Lenat, 1995; Speer et al., 2017). However, evalu-ating the degree of common sense possessed by amachine remains difﬁcult.Oneimportantbenchmark,theWinogradSchema Challenge (Levesque, 2011), asks mod-els to correctly solve paired instances of coref-erence resolution. While the Winograd SchemaChallenge remains a tough dataset, the difﬁcultyof generating examples has led to only a smallavailable collection of 150 examples. The Choiceof Plausible Alternatives (COPA) is a similarly im-portant but small dataset consisting of 500 devel-opment and 500 test questions (Roemmele et al.,2011). Each question asks which of two alterna-tives best reﬂects a cause or effect relation to thepremise. For both datasets, scalability is an issuewhen evaluating modern modeling approaches.\f4151With the recent adoption of crowdsourcing, sev-eral larger datasets have emerged, focusing on pre-dicting relations between situations or events innatural language. JHU Ordinal Commonsense In-ference requests a label from 1-5 for the plau-sibility that one situation entails another (Zhanget al., 2017). The Story Cloze Test (also referred toas ROC Stories) pits ground-truth endings to sto-ries against implausible false ones (Mostafazadehet al., 2016). Interpolating these approaches, Sit-uations with Adversarial Generations (SWAG),asks models to choose the correct description ofwhat happens next after an initial event (Zellerset al., 2018b). LM-based techniques achieve veryhigh performance on the Story Cloze Test andSWAG by ﬁne-tuning a pre-trained LM on the tar-get task (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).Investigations of commonsense datasets, and ofnatural language datasets more generally, have re-vealed the difﬁculty in creating benchmarks thatmeasure the understanding of a program ratherthan its ability to take advantage of distributionalbiases, and to model the annotation process (Gu-rurangan et al., 2018; Poliak et al., 2018). Annota-tion artifacts in the Story Cloze Test, for example,allow models to achieve high performance whileonly looking at the proposed endings and ignor-ing the stories (Schwartz et al., 2017; Cai et al.,2017). Thus, the development of benchmarks forcommon sense remains a difﬁcult challenge.Researchers have also investigated question an-swering that utilizes common sense. Science ques-tions often require common sense, and have re-cently received attention (Clark et al., 2018; Mi-haylov et al., 2018; Ostermann et al., 2018); how-ever, they also need specialized scientiﬁc knowl-edge. In contrast to these efforts, our work stud-ies common sense without requiring additionalinformation.SQUABU created a small hand-curated test of common sense and science ques-tions (Davis, 2016), which are difﬁcult for currenttechniques to solve. In this work, we create simi-larly well-crafted questions but at a larger scale.3Dataset GenerationOur goal is to develop a method for generatingquestions that can be easily answered by humanswithout context, and require commonsense knowl-edge. We generate multiple-choice questions in aprocess that comprises the following steps.1. We extract subgraphs from CONCEPTNET,Dust in house? (attic, yard, street)Find glass outside? (bar, fork, car)Makes you happy? (laugh, sad, fall)Filter edges from ConceptNet with rulesExtract subgraphs from ConceptNetCrowdworkers author questionsCrowdworkers filter questions by qualityCollect relevant snippets via search engineXdustatticyardstreetDust in house?

We ask crowdsourcing workers to authorthree questions per subgraph (one per targetconcept), to add two additional distractors perquestion, and to verify questions’ quality.3. We add textual context to each question byquerying a search engine and retrieving websnippets.The entire data generation process is summarizedin Figure 2. We now elaborate on each of the steps:Extraction fromCONCEPTNETCONCEPT-NET is a graph knowledge-base G ⊆C × R × C,where the nodes C represent natural language con-cepts, and edges R represent commonsense re-lations.Triplets (c1, r, c2) carry commonsenseknowledge such as ‘(gambler, CapableOf, losemoney)’.CONCEPTNET contains 32 milliontriplets. To select a subset of triplets for crowd-sourcing we take the following steps:1. We ﬁlter triplets with general relations (e.g.,RelatedTo) or relations that are alreadywell-explored in NLP (e.g., IsA). In total weuse 22 relations.2. We ﬁlter triplets where one of the concepts ismore than four words or not in English.3. We ﬁlter triplets where the edit distance be-tween c1 and c2 is too low.This results in a set of 236,208 triplets (q, r, a),where we call the ﬁrst concept the question con-cept and the second concept the answer concept.We aim to generate questions that contain the\f4152question concept and where the answer is the an-swer concept. To create multiple-choice questionswe need to choose distractors for each question.Sampling distractors at random from CONCEPT-NET is a bad solution, as such distractors are easyto eliminate using simple surface clues.To remedy this, we propose to create ques-tion sets:for each question concept q andrelation rwe group three different triplets{(q, r, a1), (q, r, a2), (q, r, a3)} (see Figure 1).This generates three answer concepts that are se-mantically similar and have a similar relation tothe question concept q. This primes crowd work-ers to formulate questions that require backgroundknowledge about the concepts in order to answerthe question.The above procedure generates approximately130,000 triplets (43,000 question sets), for whichwe can potentially generate questions.Crowdsourcing questionsWe used AmazonMechanical Turk (AMT) workers to generate andvalidate commonsense questions.AMT workers saw, for every question set, thequestion concept and three answer concepts. Theywere asked to formulate three questions, whereall questions contain the question concept. Eachquestion should have as an answer one of the an-swer concepts, but not the other two. To discour-age workers from providing simple surface cluesfor the answer, they were instructed to avoid us-ing words that have a strong relation to the answerconcept, for example, not to use the word ‘open’when the answer is ‘door’.Formulating questions for our task is non-trivial. Thus, we only accept annotators for whichat least 75% of the questions they formulate passthe veriﬁcation process described below.Adding additional distractorsTo make thetask more difﬁcult, we ask crowd-workers to addtwo additional incorrect answers to each formu-lated question. One distractor is selected from aset of answer concepts with the same relation tothe question concept in CONCEPTNET (Figure 1,in red). The second distractor is formulated man-ually by the workers themselves (Figure 1, in pur-ple). Workers were encouraged to formulate a dis-tractor that would seem plausible or related to thequestion but easy for humans to dismiss as incor-rect. In total, each formulated question is accom-panied with ﬁve candidate answers, including oneMeasurementValue# CONCEPTNET distinct question nodes2,254# CONCEPTNET distinct answer nodes12,094# CONCEPTNET distinct nodes12,107# CONCEPTNET distinct relation lables22average question length (tokens)13.41long questions (more than 20 tokens)10.3%average answer length (tokens)1.5# answers with more than 1 token44%# of distinct words in questions14,754# of distinct words in answers4,911Table 1: Key statistics for COMMONSENSEQAcorrect answer and four distractors.Verifying questions qualityWe train a disjointgroup of workers to verify the generated questions.Veriﬁers annotate a question as unanswerable, orchoose the right answer. Each question is veri-ﬁed by 2 workers, and only questions veriﬁed by atleast one worker that answered correctly are used.This processes ﬁlters out 15% of the questions.Adding textual contextTo examine whetherweb text is useful for answering commonsensequestions, we add textual information to eachquestion in the following way: We issue a webquery to Google search for every question andcandidate answer, concatenating the answer to thequestion, e.g., ‘What does a parent tell their childto do after they’ve played with a lot of toys? +“clean room”’. We take the ﬁrst 100 result snip-pets for each of the ﬁve answer candidates, yield-ing a context of 500 snippets per question. Usingthis context, we can investigate the performanceof reading comprehension (RC) models on COM-MONSENSEQA.Overall, we generated 12,247 ﬁnal examples,from a total of 16,242 that were formulated. Thetotal cost per question is $0.33. Table 1 describesthe key statistics of COMMONSENSEQA.4Dataset AnalysisCONCEPTNET concepts and relationsCOM-MONSENSEQA builds on CONCEPTNET, whichcontains concepts such as dog, house, or rowboat, connected by relations such as Causes,CapableOf, or Antonym.The top-5 ques-tion concepts in COMMONSENSEQA are ‘Person’(3.1%), ‘People’ (2.0%), ‘Human’ (0.7%), ‘Water’(0.5%) and ‘Cat’ (0.5%).

Skills are labeled edges, and concepts arenodes.worth noting that since question formulators werenot shown the CONCEPTNET relation, they oftenasked questions that probe other relationships be-tween the concepts.For example, the question“What do audiences clap for?” was generatedfrom the AtLocation relation, but focuses onsocial conventions instead.QuestionformulationQuestionformulatorswere instructed to create questions with highlanguage variation. 122 formulators contributedto question generation.However, 10 workersformulated more than 85% of the questions.We analyzed the distribution of ﬁrst and secondwords in the formulated questions along with ex-ample questions. Figure 4 presents the breakdown.Interestingly, only 44% of the ﬁrst words are WH-words. In about 5% of the questions, formulatorsused ﬁrst names to create a context story, and in7% they used the word “if” to present a hypothet-ical question. This suggests high variability in thequestion language.Commonsense SkillsTo analyze the types ofcommonsense knowledge needed to correctly an-CategoryDeﬁnition%SpatialConcept A appears near Concept B41Cause & EffectConcept A causes Concept B23Has partsConcept A contains Concept B as one of its parts23Is member ofConcept A belongs to the larger class of Concept B17PurposeConcept A is the purpose of Concept B18SocialIt is a social convention that Concept A15correlates with Concept BActivityConcept A is an activity performed in the context8of Concept BDeﬁnitionConcept A is a deﬁnition of Concept B6PreconditionsConcept A must hold true in order for Concept B to3take placeTable 3: Skills and their frequency in the sampled data.As each example can be annotated with multiple skills,the total frequency does not sum to 100%.swer questions in COMMONSENSEQA, we ran-domly sampled 100 examples from the develop-ment set and performed the following analysis.For each question, we explicitly annotated thetypes of commonsense skills that a human usesto answer the question. We allow multiple com-monsense skills per questions, with an average of1.75 skills per question. Figure 3 provides threeexample annotations. Each annotation contains anode for the answer concept, and other nodes forconcepts that appear in the question or latent con-cepts. Labeled edges describe the commonsenseskill that relates the two nodes. We deﬁned com-monsense skills based on the analysis of LoBueand Yates (2011), with slight modiﬁcations to ac-commodate the phenomena in our data. Table 3presents the skill categories we used, their deﬁni-tion and their frequency in the analyzed examples.5Baseline ModelsOur goal is to collect a dataset of commonsensequestions that are easy for humans, but hard forcurrent NLU models. To evaluate this, we experi-ment with multiple baselines.

Training states whether the model was trainedon COMMONSENSEQA, or was only trained a differ-ent dataset. Context states whether the model uses extracontext as input.and (b) whether context (web snippets) is used.We now elaborate on the different baselines.a VECSIM A model that chooses the answer withhighest cosine similarity to the question, where thequestion and answers are represented by an aver-age of pre-trained word embeddings.b LM1B Inspired by Trinh and Le (2018), weemploy a large language model (LM) from Joze-fowicz et al. (2016), which was pre-trained onthe One Billion Words Benchmark (Chelba et al.,2013). We use this model in two variations. Inthe ﬁrst (LM1B-CONCAT), we simply concate-nate each answer to the question. In the second(LM1B-REP), we ﬁrst cluster questions accordingto their ﬁrst two words. Then, we recognize ﬁvehigh-frequency preﬁxes that cover 35% of the de-velopment set (e.g., “what is”). We rephrase ques-tions that ﬁt into one of these preﬁxes as a declar-ative sentence that contains the answer. E.g., werephrase “What is usually next to a door?” and thecandidate answer “wall” to “Wall is usually nextto a door”. For questions that do not start withthe above preﬁxes, we concatenate the answer asin LM1B-CONCAT. In both variations we returnthe answer with highest LM probability.c QABILINEAR This model, propsed by Yu et al.(2014) for QA, scores an answer ai with a bilinearmodel: qWa⊤i , where the question q and answersai are the average pre-trained word embeddingsand W is a learned parameter matrix. A softmaxlayer over the candidate answers is used to trainthe model with cross-entropy loss.d QACOMPARE This model is similar to an NLImodel from Liu et al. (2016). The model repre-sents the interaction between the question q and acandidate answer ai as: h = relu([q; ai; q⊙ai; q−ai]W1 + b1), where ’;’ denotes concatenation and⊙is element-wise product. Then, the model pre-dicts an answer score using a feed forward layer:hW2 + b2. Average pre-trained embeddings andsoftmax are used to train the model.e ESIM We use ESIM, a strong NLI model(Chen et al., 2016).Similar to Zellers et al.(2018b), we change the output layer size to thenumber of candidate answers, and apply softmaxto train with cross-entropy loss.f BIDAF++ A state-of-the-art RC model, thatuses the retrieved Google web snippets (Section 3)as context. We augment BIDAF (Seo et al., 2016)with a self-attention layer and ELMo representa-\f4155tions (Peters et al., 2018; Huang et al., 2018). Toadapt to the multiple-choice setting, we choose theanswer with highest model probability.g GENERATIVEPRE-TRAINEDTRANS-FORMER (GPT) Radford et al. (2018) proposeda method for adapting pre-trained LMs to performa wide range of tasks. We applied their model toCOMMONSENSEQA by encoding each questionand its candidate answers as a series of delimiter-separated sequences. For example, the question“If you needed a lamp to do your work, wherewould you put it?”, and the candidate answer“bedroom” would become “[start] If ...?[sep] bedroom [end]”.The hidden repre-sentations over each [end] token are convertedto logits by a linear transformation and passedthrough a softmax to produce ﬁnal probabilitiesfor the answers. We used the same pre-trained LMand hyper-parameters for ﬁne-tuning as Radfordet al. (2018) on ROC Stories, except with a batchsize of 10.h BERT Similarly to the GPT, BERT ﬁne-tunesa language model and currently holds state-of-the-art across a broad range of tasks (Devlin et al.,2018).BERT uses a masked language mod-eling objective, which predicts missing wordsmasked from unlabeled text. To apply BERT toCOMMONSENSEQA, we linearize each question-answer pair into a delimiter-separated sequence(i.e., “[CLS] If ... ? [SEP] bedroom [SEP]”)then ﬁne-tune the pre-trained weights from un-cased BERT-LARGE.1 Similarly to the GPT, thehidden representations over each [CLS] token arerun through a softmax layer to create the predic-tions. We used the same hyper-parameters as De-vlin et al. (2018) for SWAG.6ExperimentsExperimental SetupWe split the data into atraining/development/test set with an 80/10/10split. We perform two types of splits: (a) ran-dom split – where questions are split uniformlyat random, and (b) question concept split – whereeach of the three sets have disjoint question con-cepts. We empirically ﬁnd (see below) that a ran-dom split is harder for models that learn fromCOMMONSENSEQA, because the same questionconcept appears in the training set and develop-ment/test set with different answer concepts, and1The original weights and code released by Google maybe found here: https://github.com/google-research/bertnetworks that memorize might fail in such a sce-nario. Since the random split is harder, we con-sider it the primary split of COMMONSENSEQA.We evaluate all models on the test set using ac-curacy (proportion of examples for which predic-tion is correct), and tune hyper-parameters for alltrained models on the development set. To under-stand the difﬁculty of the task, we add a SANITYmode, where we replace the hard distractors (thatshare a relation with the question concept and oneformulated by a worker) with random CONCEPT-NET distractors. We expect a reasonable baselineto perform much better in this mode.For pre-trained word embeddings we consider300d GloVe embeddings (Pennington et al., 2014)and 300d Numberbatch CONCEPTNET node em-beddings (Speer et al., 2017), which are kept ﬁxedat training time.We also combine ESIM with1024d ELMo contextual representations, whichare also ﬁxed during training.Human EvaluationTo test human accuracy, wecreated a separate task for which we did not use aqualiﬁcation test, nor used AMT master workers.We sampled 100 random questions and for eachquestion gathered answers from ﬁve workers thatwere not involved in question generation. Humansobtain 88.9% accuracy, taking a majority vote foreach question.ResultsTable 5 presents test set results for allmodels and setups.The best baselines are BERT-LARGE and GPTwith an accuracy of 55.9% and 45.5%, respec-tively, on the random split (63.6% and 55.5%, re-spectively, on the question concept split). This iswell below human accuracy, demonstrating thatthe benchmark is much easier for humans. Nev-ertheless, this result is much higher than random(20%), showing the ability of language models tostore large amounts of information related to com-monsense knowledge.The top part of Table 5 describes untrainedmodels. We observe that performance is higherthan random, but still quite low. The middle partdescribes models that were trained on COMMON-SENSEQA, where BERT-LARGE obtains best per-formance, as mentioned above.ESIM modelsfollow BERT-LARGE and GPT, and obtain muchlower performance.

Welabeled examples with categories (possibly morethan one per example) and then computed the av-erage accuracy of the model for each category.We found that the model does well (77.7% ac-curacy) on examples where surface clues hint tothe correct answer. Examples that involve nega-tion or understanding antonyms have lower accu-racy (42.8%), similarly to examples that requirefactoid knowledge (38.4%). Accuracy is partic-ularly low in questions where the correct answerhas ﬁner granularity compared to one of the dis-tractors (35.4%), and in cases where the correctanswer needs to meet a conjunction of conditions,and the distractor meets only one of them (23.8%).Learning CurvesTo extrapolate how currentmodels might perform with more data, we evalu-ated BERT-large on the development set, trainingwith varying amounts of data. The resulting learn-ing curves are plotted in ﬁgure 5. For each trainingset size, hyper-parameters were identical to sec-tion 5, except the number of epochs was varied tokeep the number of mini-batches during trainingconstant. To deal with learning instabilities, eachdata point is the best of 3 runs.

We describe a pro-cess for generating difﬁcult questions at scale us-ing CONCEPTNET, perform a detailed analysis ofthe dataset, which elucidates the unique propertiesof our dataset, and extensively evaluate on a strongsuite of baselines. We ﬁnd that the best model isa pre-trained LM tuned for our task and obtains55.9% accuracy, dozens of points lower than hu-man accuracy. We hope that this dataset facili-tates future work in incorporating commonsenseknowledge into NLU systems.AcknowledgmentsWe thank the anonymous reviewers for their con-structive feedback.

The report explores the definition of unaccompanied minors in each jurisdiction covered and the issues of protection, restrictions on claiming asylum, and detention of unaccompanied minors as well as refugee resettlement and family reunification.  I.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  Unaccompanied minors are defined differently depending on the jurisdiction. For the most part, unaccompanied minors are defined as asylum seekers under the age of 18 who are not accompanied by an adult when entering the state’s territory. Some countries, such as Canada and Brazil, have definitions in policy or in guidance documents. Others, such as Chile, draw on the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, with elaborations through jurisprudence. In the EU, the definition is codified in the directly applicable Dublin III Regulation and the EU Qualification Directive, which must be implemented into the law of the member states. National legislation defining unaccompanied minors in the EU member states Greece, Germany, Italy, and France, draws on the EU definition. In Israel, procedures from the Population and Immigration Authority form the definition. Malta provides a definition in legislation, which is further defined in regulation. The UK sets out its rules in regulation. Russia, on the other hand, does not distinguish between minor and adult asylum seekers. Some countries, such as Italy, make distinctions between minors over 14 years of age and those younger than 14 years of age.  II.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  Some countries have restrictions on the ability for migrants to claim asylum, whether adults or unaccompanied minors. In Canada, the United States is designated as a safe third country, and asylum seekers crossing the land border from the United States are generally inadmissible for refugee status in Canada, with exceptions, including unaccompanied minors. In the EU, the Dublin III Regulation provides that the member state where the minor has family present is responsible for providing asylum to the child. Germany, Malta, and the UK have safe country of origin policies, where asylum requests from certain countries are presumed to be without merit. Finland does not maintain a safe country list, but assumes that all EU member states are safe countries. In all EU states, the law provides that asylum seekers can only make an asylum claim in one EU country. It also deems Turkey to be a safe third country. Israel makes it a criminal offense to cross outside of an official border crossing, precluding an asylum claim. Greece and Turkey, however, provide minors with an exemption from the expedited removal procedure, without exempting them from the overall inadmissibility policy. In Russia, minors can be returned to their country of origin if they are from member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 2 III.  Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  Many countries offer residency to unaccompanied minors, and decisions must consider the best interests of the child. In Brazil, unaccompanied minors are eligible for resident visas. In countries such as Germany and Canada, child protection agencies are contacted to care for the unaccompanied minor, and the children are entitled to a legal representative who must take into account the views of the minor. Minors have the right to seek and receive asylum following international treaties currently in force in Chile. In the EU, unaccompanied minors are entitled to a legal representative, with fees paid for by the state. In Greece, unaccompanied minors who are victims of human trafficking activity and who are cooperating with the authorities for the prosecution of this activity may be given visas on a discretionary basis. In Finland, a legal representative is appointed by the district court, but the relationship is severed once the minor turns 18 years of age. In France, minors are generally exempt from removal proceedings. In Israel, minors must be interviewed in a way that is sensitive to the potential trauma they may have experienced. Israel also distinguishes between asylum seekers eligible for citizenship under the Law of Return and those who are ineligible, with some exceptions for Ukrainian citizens. Russia does not provide for the appointment of a legal representative, nor are children eligible for any specific visa programs.  Services provided to unaccompanied minors in the jurisdictions covered by this report, including housing, education, vocational training, and healthcare, are set out in Figure 1.   \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 3  IV.  Detention of Unaccompanied Minors  Jurisdictions take varying approaches to the detention of unaccompanied minors. EU law requires that children not be housed in prison facilities or co-mingled with adult detainees. Furthermore, detention must be as short as possible and only used as a last resort. Brazil bans the collective detention of classes of migrants and will not repatriate minors, a policy also implemented in France. In Germany, minors and families with minors should only be detained in exceptional circumstances and without endangering the well-being of the child. Greece similarly severely limits the detention of minors, restricting it to less than 25 days. Israel allows detention for up to 60 days with an extension permissible if release would harm public health or the security of the state. Italy places children in foster families as an alternative to detention. In Malta, unaccompanied minors are not to be held in detention, although, in practice, many are held under the authority of health regulations. In Finland, minors over the age of 15 can be detained, and the state also provides financial assistance to a minor who wishes to return to their country of origin. In the UK, minors can only be held in immigration detention facilities for a maximum of 24 hours. In Canada, minors can only be held in immigration detention as a last resort and must attend school if required by provincial law for persons of their age.  V.  Resettlement and Integration Programs  Unaccompanied minors are sometimes eligible for resettlement or integration programs. In Brazil, the migration policy provides for such programs and social benefits, public goods, education, comprehensive public legal assistance, work, housing, banking services, and social security. According to EU law, once their application has been approved, asylum seekers must be granted access to employment, education, procedures for recognition of qualifications, social welfare, healthcare, and accommodation under the same conditions as nationals. Some states in Germany have established special education programs geared toward migrant communities to aid in their integration. In Greece, some migrants are resettled elsewhere in Europe under an EU resettlement program. In France, the law and jurisprudence grant unaccompanied minors access to the same programs and services as French citizens. Malta recently launched an integration program that leads to the issuance of a certificate after 230 hours of instruction. Turkey provides child asylum seekers with basic educational programming, but does not envisage the permanent settlement of refugees on its territory, instead working with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) toward the resettlement of asylum seekers. In the UK, local authorities continue to have a duty to support the integration of asylum seekers between 18 and 21 years of age. Canada restricts the resettlement of unaccompanied minors to those who apply in-country rather than from abroad through the UNHCR, unless they have family already present in Canada.  VI.  Family Reunification  Some jurisdictions provide for family reunification as a right, while others restrict family reunification in scope, geography, or at the discretion of the decision maker. In Chile, the possibility of family reunification with the minor’s parents will be evaluated, except when the children’s best interests require prolonging the separation. EU legislation provides \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 4 unaccompanied minors with the right to be reunited with family members in any of the EU member states. Family reunification must be requested within three months of arrival and is restricted to first-degree relatives in an ascending line unless there are no such relatives available. In Germany, parents of unaccompanied minors who have been granted certain residence titles must be issued a temporary residence permit to move to that country. Greece restricts family reunification to legal residents and refugee status holders. In France, unmarried children may generally request to be joined by their parents and their minor unmarried siblings who are still dependent on the parents. UK law places a duty on the government to trace the family of the unaccompanied minor with the best interests of the child as a primary, but not sole, priority, but suggests that reunification does not necessarily have to occur in the UK. In Canada, minors cannot apply for family reunification, but the minor’s parents can apply to the minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 5 Brazil Eduardo Soares Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Brazil has approved the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child, the UN Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, and the UN Convention for the Reduction of Statelessness. A constitutional principle provides for the granting of asylum to aliens, and states that everyone is equal before the law with no distinction between aliens and Brazilian citizens.   A new migration law and its regulation were enacted based on principles of non-criminalization, nondiscrimination, equal opportunity, and protection of children. They also provide for the regulation of unaccompanied children and adolescents who arrive in the country and the granting of a residence permit.    The Child and Adolescent Statute provides for the full protection of children and adolescents, reiterates the constitutional principle of nondiscrimination, and, among other things, defines the ages of children and adolescents.   Two resolutions and an ordinance address the issue of unaccompanied, separated or undocumented minors entering the country and the necessary procedures and bodies responsible for their migratory regularization.   I.  Introduction  A.

The interview’s purpose is to assess the juvenile’s vulnerability and to record the personal details, including, when possible, identification of the juvenile’s affiliation and that of any siblings, as well as the juvenile’s citizenship and that of the father, mother, and siblings.92   The interview must be carried out within the parameters established in the Annex to CONANDA Resolution No. 232, limiting the report strictly to what is necessary for the fulfillment of its purpose.93   The DPU, or another protection body, represents children and adolescents who are in Brazilian territory in presenting requests for migratory regularization, requests for documents, and other acts for the protection and guarantee of their rights, including interviewing and filling out the FAP, in accordance with the applicable terms of CONANDA Resolution No. 232.94  The bodies listed in article 10 of CONANDA Resolution No. 232 are responsible for requests for migratory regularization or requests for recognition of refugee status, requests for documents, and other acts of protection, such as filling out a FAP as well as accompanying the unaccompanied, separated or undocumented child or adolescent in the procedures subsequent  88 Id. art. 9 § 2. 89 Id. art. 9 § 3. 90 Id. art. 9 § 4. 91 Id. art. 9 § 8. 92 Id. art. 10. 93 Id. art. 10 § 1. 94 Id. art. 10 § 2. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 17 to the minor’s preliminary identification, with the cooperation and awareness of the members of the Sistema de Garantia dos Direitos da Criança e do Adolescente (Guarantee System for the Rights of Children and Adolescents),95 such as the Tutelary Council, Municipal Council for the Rights of Children and Adolescents, the Juvenile Court, the public prosecutor’s office, and the public defender’s office of the local state.96   If necessary, and based on cooperation mechanisms, the DPU may call on a representative of the state public defender’s office to act in cases whose treatment is governed by CONANDA Resolution No. 232.97 The request for migratory regularization or for recognition of refugee status, accompanied or not by the FAP, may be presented to the Federal Police unit through the guardian, provisional or not, or a special curator appointed by the court. In these cases, the state must provide free legal assistance to children and adolescents.98   Under article 10, after the DPU or another protection body conducts the interview and fills out the FAP, it will carry out the request for migratory regularization or recognition of refugee status, also indicating the possibility of:   I - reintegration into living with the family of origin, natural or extended, according to legal parameters and attention to the best interests of the child and adolescent, for their full protection;   II - measures to facilitate family reunification, current or future;   III - permanence with the guardian who accompanies the child or adolescent;   IV - need to be referred to a shelter service for children and adolescents, upon application of a protective measure by the competent authority, pursuant to Law No. 8,069/1990;   V - protection as a victim of human trafficking;   VI - another measure of migratory regularization, or protection as a refugee or stateless person, according to the legislation in force;    95 The Guarantee System for the Rights of Children and Adolescents represents the interaction and integration between the various members of the state and civil society in the promotion, defense, and control of the realization of the rights of children and adolescents provided for in the Child and Adolescent Statute. This means that, although civil society, the family, public bodies and federal, state, and municipal authorities have specific responsibilities to perform, so that children and adolescents have their rights fully guaranteed, these members have equal responsibility to prevent, investigate, and solve the existing problems for the effectiveness of these guarantees. The public bodies of the judiciary system are part of the Guarantee System along with the military, civil, and federal police; the tutelary councils; human rights organizations; the councils for the rights of children and adolescents; and the various other councils that work in the discussion, formulation, and control of public policies.

A juvenile’s opinion must be considered by the competent authority, ensuring that the juvenile is being heard and participating.100 Where any measure is indicated that implies the return of a child or adolescent to the country of origin or residence, a specific analysis on protection risks must be carried out, considering, in addition, the reasons that motivated the juvenile’s displacement.101  Under the provisions of article 14, paragraph 1, of CONANDA Resolution No. 232, if there is enough information to lead to the search and location of the parents or guardians without risk to the protection of the child or adolescent, the competent official body or international body must be notified to adopt the necessary measures with the country of origin or residence, in conjunction with the protection network of the place where the child or adolescent is located in Brazil, aimed at family reunification.102  The Juvenile Court may, at any time, after hearing the Public Prosecutor’s Office:   I - Appoint a special curator for the protocol of the request for residence or refuge authorization, according to the sole paragraph of article 142 of the Child and Adolescent Statute;   II - Appreciate the request for migratory regularization;   III - Activate the DPU for the purposes of article 10, items II and III of CONANDA Resolution No. 232, if it has not been done at a previous moment, observing the provisions of CONANDA Resolution No. 232 by the DPU.103   In cases of children or adolescents from native peoples and traditional communities, an interpreter or cultural mediator and anthropologist must accompany them.104    99 Id. art. 14. 100 Id. art. 14 § 1. 101 Id. art. 14 § 2. 102 Id. art. 14 § 4. 103 Id. art. 17. 104 Id. art. 17 (sole para.). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 19 V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Law No. 13,445 of May 24, 2017  As discussed in Part I.B.1, above, the migratory policy of Brazil is governed by, inter alia, non-criminalization of migration,105 integral protection and attention to the superior interest of the migrant child and adolescent,106 and repudiation of collective deportation or deportation practices.107 Article 49 of Law No. 13,445 defines repatriation as an administrative measure to return a person to the country of origin or nationality where there is an impediment to the person remaining in Brazil.108 Repatriation must not be applied to a person in a situation of refuge or statelessness, in fact or in law; to a minor under 18 years of age who is unaccompanied or separated from his family, except in cases where it proves to be favorable to the guarantee of the minor’s rights or for the reintegration of the family of origin; or to those who need humanitarian aid. Additionally, in no case will a person be repatriated to a country or region that may pose a risk to the life, personal integrity, or freedom of the person.109  B.  Decree No. 9,199 of November 20, 2017  Decree No. 9,199 states that the beneficiary of stateless protection, refuge, or political asylum will not be repatriated, deported, or expelled while there is a pending process of recognition of the beneficiary’s condition in Brazil.110   Immigrants or visitors who have not reached the age of majority and are unaccompanied or separated from their family will not be repatriated or deported unless compulsory removal would be more favorable for the guarantee of their rights or for their reintegration into their family or community of origin.111   The DPU must be notified, preferably by electronic means, when immigrants who have not reached the age of civil majority are unaccompanied or separated from their family and when their immediate repatriation is not possible.112  C.

Resettlement and Integration Programs  A.  Federal Constitution  According to the Brazilian Constitution, everyone is equal before the law with no distinction whatsoever, guaranteeing to Brazilians and foreigners residing in the country the inviolability of the rights to life, liberty, equality, security, and property, according to the terms defined in article 5 of the Constitution.117  Article 227 establishes that it is the duty and highest priority of the family, the society, and the government to protect the rights to life, health, nourishment, education, leisure, professional training, culture, dignity, respect, liberty, and family and community harmony of children, adolescents, and jovens (youths), in addition to safeguarding them against all forms of negligence, discrimination, exploitation, violence, cruelty, and oppression.118 The government must promote full health assistance programs for children, adolescents, and youths, permitting participation by nongovernmental entities. 119    113 Resolução Conjunta No. 1, de 9 de Agosto de 2017, art. 4. 114 Id. art. 5. 115 Resolução CONANDA No. 232, de 28 de Dezembro de 2022, art. 4. 116 Id. art. 4 (sole para.). 117 C.F. art. 5. 118 Id. art. 227.

However, the provisions of the Child and Adolescent Statute are applicable to adolescents aged between 15 and 18 years, and, exceptionally, the Youth Statute, when it does not conflict with the norms of full protection of adolescents set forth by the Child and Adolescent Statute (art. 1 § 2). 119 C.F. art. 227 § 1. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 21 B.  Law No. 8,069 of July 13, 1990  As discussed in Part I.B.3, above, the Child and Adolescent Statute states that children and adolescents enjoy all the fundamental rights inherent to the human person.120 Furthermore, the rights set forth in the statute apply to all children and adolescents, without discrimination.121  C.  Law No. 13,445 of May 24, 2017  Law No. 13,445 establishes that migrants must be guaranteed the inviolable right to life, liberty, equality, security, and property in the national territory on an equal basis with Brazilian nationals.122 Furthermore, the migratory policy of Brazil is governed by equal and free access of migrants to services, programs, and social benefits, bens públicos (public goods), education, comprehensive public legal assistance, work, housing, banking services, and social security.123  As explained, Brazilian laws do not make any distinction between migrants and Brazilian citizens, and the researched federal legislation did provide any specific provision regarding resettlement or integration programs other than the access to public services as indicated in Law No. 13,445.   VII.  Family Reunification  A.  Law No. 13,445 of May 24, 2017  The legislation provides several provisions that favor family reunification. As discussed in Part I.B.1, above, a guarantee of the right to family reunion is one of the principles that guide the migratory policy of Brazil, as stated in article 3 of Law No. 13,445.124 In addition, family reunion with their spouses or partners and children, relatives, and dependents must be ensured to migrants.125  The possibility of family reunion is also provided for in article 49 of Law No. 13,445, which states, as an exception, that repatriation may be applied to a person in a situation of refuge or statelessness, who is a minor under 18 years of age, unaccompanied or separated from the minor’s family, where it proves to be favorable to the guarantee of the minor’s rights or for the reintegration of the family of origin, provided that there is no risk to the minor.126    120 Estatuto da Criança e do Adolescente, Lei No. 8,069, de 13 de Julho de 1990, art. 3. 121 Id. art. 3 (sole para.). 122 Lei No. 13.445, de 24 de Maio de 2017, art. 4. 123 Id. art. 3 XI. 124 Lei No. 13.445, de 24 de Maio de 2017, art. 3 VIII. 125 Id. art. 4 III. 126 Id. art. 49 § 4. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 22 B.

Joint Resolution No. 1 of August 9, 2017  During migratory regularization procedures for a child or adolescent, the public defender responsible for the regularization must take into account in the analysis, among other things, the possibility of the minor’s return to family life, according to the parameters of full protection and attention to the best interests of the child or adolescent, and a measure of protection by family reunion.129  D.  CONANDA Resolution No. 232 of December 28, 2022  Article 14 of CONANDA Resolution No. 232 also states that, during the request for migratory regularization, the possibility of reintegration in the natural or extended family of origin, according to legal parameters and with attention to the best interests of the child or adolescent, for the minor’s full protection, and measures to facilitate current or future family reunification, inter alia, must also be indicated.130   The resolution states that where any measure is applied that implies the return of the child or adolescent to the country of origin or residence, a specific analysis of protection risks must be carried out, considering, in addition, the reasons that motivated the minor’s displacement.131 Furthermore, if it is possible to locate the parents or guardians and there is no risk to the child or adolescent, the competent national or international authorities must be contacted to adopt the necessary measures with the country of origin or residence for family reunification.132   127 Decreto No. 9.199, de 20 de Novembro de 2017, art. 157. 128 Id. art. 157 § 1. 129 Id. art. 13 I, II. 130 Resolução CONANDA No. 232, de 28 de Dezembro de 2022, art. 14 I, II. 131 Id. art. 14 § 2. 132 Id. art. 14 § 4. \f The Law Library of Congress 23 Canada Michael Chalupovitsch Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY While there is no legislated definition of an unaccompanied minor in Canadian immigration and refugee law, definitions are set in policy documents. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act must be interpreted in line with the Convention on the Rights of the Child. While there is a Safe Third Country Agreement with the United States restricting asylum claims at the land border, unaccompanied minors are exempt. Unaccompanied minors generally follow the same refugee determination process as adults, but are entitled to a designated representative. Most unaccompanied minors are referred to provincial child protection services, and in most cases may not be held in detention. Resettlement and family reunification programs are limited, though the parents of unaccompanied minors can be allowed to enter Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds at the discretion of the minister of immigration, refugees and citizenship.   I.  Introduction  Canada’s refugee and immigration system is governed by the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).1 The responsible agencies for implementing Canada’s refugee and immigration system are Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). An arms-length tribunal, the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada (IRB), adjudicates in-country refugee claims. Provincial and territorial governments also play a role in delivering social services for refugees as well as selecting nominees for immigrants, but are not involved in admitting refugee claimants arriving in Canada.  It has been estimated that up to 3,000 unaccompanied children claim refugee status in Canada each year.2  II.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  While there is no legislated definition of unaccompanied minors in Canadian law, in 1996 the IRB issued guidelines for the adjudication of child refugee claims. One of the classes   consists of children who are alone in Canada without their parents or anyone who purports to be a family member. For example, an older child may be living on his or her own or a  1 Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), S.C. 2001, c. 27, https://perma.cc/KQ9N-XC8C. 2 Maya Reisdorf, ’Inhumane and Degrading’: How Canada’s Immigration Policies Fail Child Refugees, part 1.A, Canadian Bar Assn. (Nov. 17, 2021), https://perma.cc/49U2-RKWD. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Canada The Law Library of Congress 24 child may be in the care of a friend of the child's family. These children should be considered unaccompanied.3  According to the Canadian Encyclopedia,  groups such as the Canadian Council for Refugees argue that the definition of an unaccompanied minor should be broad enough to recognize that even in cases where the child may be accompanied by another relative, such as a 19-year-old sibling, they still require additional supports when settling in Canada without their parents as guardians. Unfortunately, while there are some protections in place, as of 2017, there is no integrated federal strategy on how to deal with separated and unaccompanied child migrants in Canada.4  In 2019, the Canadian Council for Refugees (CCR), a non-governmental organization, passed a resolution to  1. Call on the federal government, in collaboration with provincial and territorial governments and NGOs, to establish a national framework for unaccompanied and separated migrant, refugee claimant and refugee children. 2. Insist that Canada’s national framework for unaccompanied and separated migrant, refugee claimant and refugee children take into account the following: a. the development of appropriate legislation, policy, protocols and safeguards to ensure fair and compassionate treatment of unaccompanied and separated minors at all stages of their settlement in Canada; b. adequate access to services and supports in all areas critical to the minor’s settlement and wellbeing (including, but not limited to: access to safe housing, education, healthcare services, legal assistance, social welfare, basic needs supports and family reunification), and; c. that Canada’s national framework for unaccompanied and separated migrant, refugee claimant and refugee children is developed and implemented in accordance with the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child and the United Nations Guidelines for the Alternative Care of Children.5  Similar to child custody cases, the claims of unaccompanied children must be adjudicated with the best interests of the child as an important factor to be considered. According to the IRCC,  [t]he IRPA does not set out specific procedures or criteria for dealing with refugee claims from children. However, Paragraph 3(3)(f) requires that the IRPA be interpreted and applied in compliance with international human rights instruments, including the Convention on the Rights of the Child.  3 IRB, Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues, Introduction (Sept. 30, 1996), https://perma.cc/95FA-KBH3. 4 Petra Molnar, “Child Migration to Canada,” The Canadian Encyclopedia (Mar. 8, 2017), https://perma.cc/A5RZ-4QRA. 5 Canadian Council for Refugees, Res. 2 of June 1, 2019, Developing a National Framework for Unaccompanied Minors in Canada, https://perma.cc/JR6E-RNC7. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Canada The Law Library of Congress 25 The Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes the obligation of a government to take measures to ensure that a child seeking refugee protection receives appropriate protection. Canada has signed and ratified this Convention.  Article 3(1) of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, notes that the “best interest of the child” should be a primary consideration in all actions concerning children. This principle has been recognized by the international community as a fundamental human right of a child.  These guidelines take into account the 1999 Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) decision on Baker v. Canada, [1999], which noted that the principles that are reflected in international human rights law may serve as an aid in interpreting domestic law.  In Legault v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), the Federal Court of Appeal noted that the interests of children must be examined with care and weighed with other factors. The “best interests” principle is but one of many factors to be considered when making a decision. There is no presumption that the “best interest of the child” must prevail over other important considerations.6  III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  Generally, persons who cross the border from the United States are not eligible to make a refugee claim in Canada, due to the existence of a Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA).7 The STCA  provides that persons seeking asylum must make that claim in the first country they reach, and that once a claim is adjudicated, the claimant cannot go to the other country and make another claim there, with the claimant being returned to the country they entered from. There are certain exemptions — for example, unaccompanied minors. The agreement was first implemented in 2004 after being signed in 2002 as part of the U.S.-Canada Smart Border Action Plan. Under the agreement, the United States is designated as a “safe third country” under section 102 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), and is based on four factors:  1. The United States being a party to the 1951 Refugee Convention and the 1984 Convention Against Torture. 2. Policies and review processes with respect to claims under the conventions. 3. The human rights record and independent judiciary of the United States. 4. The existence of an STCA.  To date, the United States is the only country designated as a “safe third country” under IRPA.8    6 Processing In-Canada Claims for Refugee Protection of Minors and Vulnerable Persons, IRCC (Apr. 11, 2019) (choose “Legislation on minor children”), https://perma.cc/3FZ3-CVN3. 7 Final Text of the Safe Third Country Agreement, IRCC (Dec. 5, 2002), https://perma.cc/4LXD-KCV7. 8 Michael Chalupovitsch, Canada: Asylum Claims along Entire Canada-US Border Now Subject to Safe Third Country Agreement, Global Legal Monitor (Apr. 6, 2023), https://perma.cc/BGF5-88F8. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Canada The Law Library of Congress 26 The STCA initially only applied to refugee applications made at official ports of entry, but on March 24, 2023, its application was extended to the entirety of the land border and most of the water border between the United States and Canada. Unaccompanied minors continue to be excepted from the terms of the STCA.  The unaccompanied minor exemption in the STCA has drawn some criticism “for excluding children who have a parent in either the US or Canada and for not providing any provisions for reuniting an unaccompanied child claimant already in Canada with a parent who is applying at the border within” the exemption.9  As noted in a recent post in the Global Legal Monitor,  [t]he constitutionality of the STCA is currently before the Supreme Court of Canada, with the CCR arguing that Canada should have reviewed the inclusion of the United States as a “safe third country” because, in its view, “key aspects of US asylum law and practice are contrary to the Refugee Convention and other international human rights protections.” The appeal was heard in October 2022, with a decision forthcoming.10  IV. Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Visas  IRPA does not provide a specific procedure for the refugee application for minors. The Act provides that it must be interpreted in line with international human rights agreements, one of which is the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child.11 The IRPA regulations state that if a CBSA officer believes that a refugee application is well founded, the application must be referred to the IRB for adjudication.12 Successful refugee applicants can apply for permanent residence status.  B. Legal Representation  Unaccompanied minors making refugee claims in Canada are entitled to have a representative designated by the IRB, which can be any person who meets certain criteria. The criteria include  • the person must be over 18 years of age; • the person must have an appreciation of the nature of the proceedings; • the person must not be in a conflict of interest situation with the child claimant such that the person must not act at the expense of the child's best interests;  9 Edit Freyo, Unsafe at Any Angle: Vulnerability-Generation on the US-Canada Border, 11, 44 Laws  12-13 (2022), https://perma.cc/SPK5-88AQ. 10 Chalupovitsch, supra note 8. 11 IRPA s. 3(3)(f) (“This Act is to be construed and applied in a manner that . . . complies with international human rights instruments to which Canada is signatory.”). 12 Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, SOR/2002-227, s. 228, https://perma.cc/UB4A-HSZN. While this section deals with removal orders, it applies to refugee applications, because in-country claimants are prima facie inadmissible to enter Canada since they do not have a visa. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Canada The Law Library of Congress 27 • the person must be willing and able to fulfill the duties of a representative and to act in the best interests of the child.13  The duties of the designated representative include  • to retain counsel; • to instruct counsel or to assist the child in instructing counsel; • to make other decisions with respect to the proceedings or to help the child make those decisions; • to inform the child about the various stages and proceedings of the claim; • to assist in obtaining evidence in support of the claim; • to provide evidence and be a witness in the claim; • to act in the best interests of the child.14  UNICEF Canada called for the repeal of the rules providing for the IRB to designate a representative for minors and called for children to  be informed about the decision-making process which they will be subject to, provided with the information about possible solutions and services they are entitled to, and be supported to express their views on these issues, whether directly themselves or through a representative. Should they wish to express themselves through a representative, there must be a process in place allowing them to have input into the selection of a representative.15  C. Role of Child Protection Agencies  According to IRCC’s operational guideline on processing child refugee protection claims, “[a[ll children (under age 18) who are without a caregiver should be considered abandoned and must be referred to the appropriate child protection agency without delay.”16 Since child protection is under provincial jurisdiction however, some provinces may not be in a position to provide child protective services to minors over 16 years of age (for example in Ontario, Nova Scotia, and New Brunswick).17 It also falls to the child protection agencies to provide legal representation for refugee claimants in their care.     13 IRB, Chairperson Guideline 3: Child Refugee Claimants: Procedural and Evidentiary Issues, supra note 3, A.II, Designated Representative. 14 Id. 15 UNICEF Canada, Children’s Rights in the Context of Migration: A UNICEF Canada Submission to the Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship 8 (undated), https://perma.cc/GT89-EGSU. 16 Processing In-Canada Claims for Refugee Protection of Minors and Vulnerable Persons, supra note 6 (choose “Presence or absence of parents, other adults”). 17 Reisdorf, supra note 2. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Canada The Law Library of Congress 28 V.  Detention of Unaccompanied Minors  The CBSA’s National Directive for the Detention or Housing of Minors states that section 60 of IRPA “affirms the principle that the detention of a minor must be a measure of last resort.”18 The directive also states that  1. Unaccompanied minors shall never be detained or housed at an [Immigration Holding Center (IHC)] unless it is for an operational reason (e.g. [Port of Entry] arrival at 03:00, outside of normal business hours) and an [alternative to detention (ATD)] cannot be found. In the event that an unaccompanied minor is held at an IHC for more than 24 hours, a CBSA officer must conduct a [best interests of the child] assessment that includes a thorough ATD review for the purpose of release. Unaccompanied minors shall also have heightened supervision (IHC staff), and access to guards, NGO staff and/or other supports as necessary.  2. If the presence of smugglers or traffickers is a concern, the matter must be discussed with [child protection services (CPS)] to ensure that adequate protection is provided …  3. In most cases, unaccompanied minors are to be released in the care of a [community-based organization] or CPS (e.g. local Children's Aid Society where a MOU is established) if they do not have a relative or trusted community link. While in their custody, the organization will make every effort to ensure that the minor meets CBSA's reporting requirements. Contact information of the organization, relative, trusted community member charged with temporary care of the minor or an [Immigration and Refugee Board] Designated Representative or lawyer must be indicated in the minor's file.19  Unaccompanied minors may not be held in segregation, they should not be co-mingled with non-family members, and “should never” be held in detention for longer than 48 hours except where “danger to the public considerations have been raised.”20  Minors in detention must also attend school from age 5 or 6 until 16 or 18 depending on the province or territory, and qualified teachers provide instruction at IHCs.21 Minors must also have access to health care services, indoor and outdoor recreation, and proper nutrition.22  A briefing note prepared for the minister of public safety in 2020 noted that between April and December 2019, one unaccompanied minor was detained.23   18 Canada Border Services Agency, National Directive for the Detention or Housing of Minors, sec. 2. https://perma.cc/L2X7-N29K. 19Id. sec. 11.  20 Id. sec. 6.8(c). 21 Id. sec. 13.3. 22 Id. sec. 6.8(g).  23 Public Safety Canada, Minors in Canada’s Immigration Detention System (Sept. 10, 2020), https://perma.cc/64AU-5LNA. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Canada The Law Library of Congress 29 Minors have the same rights as adults in terms of challenging detention orders, which can be appealed to the IRB’s Refugee Appeal Division, or judicially reviewed by the Federal Court.  VI.  Resettlement and Integration Programs  According to a United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) handbook, the following options exist for the resettlement of unaccompanied minors who are applying for refugee protection in Canada from abroad.  If an unaccompanied has family in Canada, they could be eligible for consideration as a Government-assisted refugee, private sponsored or sponsored under Canada’s Family Class Program.  Referrals of unaccompanied minors should always be sent to the Resettlement Operations Division at Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship headquarters in Ottawa. In coordination with the appropriate local office, the minor’s relatives in Canada will then be contacted to determine their willingness and ability to provide support and act as guardians for the minor.  If an unaccompanied minor abroad has no family in Canada willing to act as the minor’s guardian, the current policy is not to accept them for resettlement.24  VII.  Family Reunification  As noted, a successful refugee applicant can apply for permanent residence in Canada. Family members can be included in the application for permanent residence, whether they are in Canada or abroad. However, the definition of family member in the IRPA does not include parents or siblings:  Child refugees cannot sponsor their parents. To sponsor a parent, the child refugee must wait until they have turned 18 years old, and must have been earning the necessary minimum income for the three years previous to their application. In 2019, the minimum necessary income to sponsor two people was [C]$41,007 [approx. US$30,300]).25  The minister of IRCC has the discretion to grant a parent’s application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds, which “must take ’into account the best interests of a child directly affected.’”26 The Supreme Court of Canada, in the case of Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), further defined how to interpret the best interests of a child in the context of a humanitarian and compassionate residence application:  Where, as here, the legislation specifically directs that the best interests of a child who is “directly affected” be considered, those interests are a singularly significant focus and perspective. The Minister’s Guidelines set out relevant considerations for this inquiry:   24 UNHCR, UNHCR Resettlement Handbook, Country Ch.: Canada 10-11 (2017), https://perma.cc/W5J2-3E4F. 25 Reisdorf, supra note 2, part 2. 26 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Canada The Law Library of Congress 30 Generally, factors relating to a child’s emotional, social, cultural and physical welfare should be taken into account when raised. Some examples of factors that applicants may raise include but are not limited to:   •         the age of the child;  •         the level of dependency between the child and the [humanitarian and compassionate] applicant or the child and their sponsor;  •         the degree of the child’s establishment in Canada;  •         the child’s links to the country in relation to which the [humanitarian and compassionate] assessment is being considered;  •         the conditions of that country and the potential impact on the child;  •         medical issues or special needs the child may have;  •         the impact to the child’s education; and  •         matters related to the child’s gender.27  27 Kanthasamy v.

This document, drafted and signed by the Supreme Court, government agencies, and international organizations, is currently in force. It guides the first foster program, further judicial measures, and follow-up obligations adopted to protect unaccompanied and separated minors by applying domestic legislation and international human rights treaties.   I.  Definition of Unaccompanied and Separated Minor  Although there is no domestic legislation in Chile that defines an unaccompanied minor, the Protocol for the Protection of Unaccompanied and Separated Children and Adolescents in the Context of Migration and/or in Need of International Protection of 2021 (Protocol) explicitly includes the definition provided by the Committee on the Rights of the Child in 2005.1   Thus, an unaccompanied migrant minor is understood to be one who “is separated from both parents and other relatives and is not in the care of an adult who, by law or custom, has such responsibility.”2   The Protocol also recognizes the concept of accompanied but separated minors, consisting of those separated from both parents or their legal or habitual guardians, but not necessarily from other relatives. Therefore, they may be minors accompanied by other adult members of the extended family. 3 The Committee on the Rights of the Child also defines this concept.4    1 Committee on the Rights of the Child, General Comment No. 6, para. 7 (2005), https://perma.cc/VUB8-LYJD (in Spanish).  2 Corte Suprema (Supreme Court), Protocolo para la protección de niños, niñas y adolescentes no acompañados y separados en el contexto de la migración y/o en necesidad de protección internacional (Dec. 13, 2021), p. 9, https://perma.cc/2NNC-ESGA. 3 Id. 4 General Comment No. 6, supra note 1, at para. 8. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Chile The Law Library of Congress 32 II.  Principles Applicable in the Protection of Unaccompanied or Separated Minors in Chile  A. No Discrimination  Treatment of an unaccompanied or separated minor should be aimed at ensuring the enjoyment of their rights, irrespective of age, gender, gender identity or sexual orientation, ethnic or national origin, disability, religion, economic status, residence or documentation status, migration status or that of their parent, mother or caregiver, statelessness, race, color, marital or family status, health or other social status, activities, expressed opinions or beliefs, or those of their parents, guardians or relatives.5  B. Comprehensive Protection of Children  The unaccompanied or separated child or adolescent who has entered the country must receive special care and help from a logic of comprehensive protection. The latter means ensuring the promotion of well-being and its development through:   • the satisfaction of basic material, physical and educational needs;  • emotional care; and  • security as adequate protection against any abuse, exploitation, or form of violence.6  C. Best Interests of the Child  Any official making a decision that impacts the life of an unaccompanied or separated child must assess, determine, consider, and protect the best interests of the child. In other words, more importance should be given to what is best for the child in order to ensure the full and effective enjoyment of their rights and holistic development.7  Determining best interests is important to assess and weigh all the elements necessary to decide in a given situation. It is a unique activity that must be carried out in each case and each review of the specific circumstances of each child. These include identity, age, sex or gender, degree of maturity, social and cultural context, nationality, ethnic background, vulnerabilities, and special protection needs.8  D. Right of the Child to be Heard and to Have Their Views Duly Taken into Account  The unaccompanied or separated minors must be heard to resolve issues according to their best interests. It is impossible to adequately determine the child's best interests unless the child's right  5 Supreme Court, supra note 2, at p. 11. 6 Id. 7 Id. at 12. 8 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Chile The Law Library of Congress 33 to be heard is realized. In addition, it must be guaranteed that these opinions are duly taken into account, depending on the age, maturity, and evolution of the child's or adolescent's faculties when making decisions and determining the best interests of each child.9  E. Reunification of the Child with Their Family  The comprehensive protection provided under the Protocol has, among its purposes, to reunite the unaccompanied or separated minors with their family, either in their country of origin, Chile, or a third country.10  When this is not possible, or the child's best interests require prolonging the separation, other durable solutions aimed at the social integration of the child shall be adopted. However, the obligations arising from articles 9 and 10 of the Convention on the Rights of the Child are binding. They should govern Chile's decisions on family reunification. Measures should be taken to ensure that parents are reunited with their children and/or to regularize their situation on the basis of the best interests of the child. 11  F. Identification of International Protection Needs and Ensuring the Principle of Non-Refoulment  The principle of non-refoulment and immediate reference to the Refugee Protection System12 must be safeguarded in cases where there is a need for international protection under the terms of article 2 of Law 20,430 regulating the Protection of Refugees, 13 as well as complementary protection under article 10 of Law 21,325 regulating Migration and Foreigners in Chile.14  Chile has the international obligation to identify foreign children who require international protection within its jurisdictions,15 whether as refugees or otherwise, through an initial assessment with guarantees of security and privacy. These guarantees exist to provide them with the appropriate and individualized treatment necessary by the adoption of special protection measures.16   9 Id. at 20. 10 Id.  11 Id. 12 Ley No. 20.430, Establece Disposiciones sobre Protección de Refugiados, Apr. 15, 2010, https://perma.cc/4785-XMBS. 13 Id. arts. 38-40. 14 Ley No. 21.325, de Migracion y Extranjeria , Apr. 20, 2021, https://perma.cc/SY5X-2LYM. 15 Supreme Court, supra note 2, p. 21. 16 Inter-American Court of Human Rights, Opinion Advisory OC-21/14, para. 82, https://perma.cc/YX9W-H3XN (in Spanish).  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Chile The Law Library of Congress 34 Minors have the right to seek and receive asylum following international treaties currently in force in Chile17 as well as Chilean domestic legislation.18 In addition, children may submit applications for refugee status in their own capacity, whether accompanied or unaccompanied.19  III.  Steps Adopted in the Protection of Unaccompanied or Separated Minors  A. First Foster  The Protocol establishes that police officers in charge of the first encounter must ensure that this meeting is carried out in an appropriate space, that communication with the minor is conducted using clear and simple language, and that a translator is provided if necessary.20  It is also a priority to determine whether the minor is accompanied or separated, and to determine their nationality or stateless status. This must be done immediately once the minor enters Chile.21  Immediate protection measures must be taken, including all necessary actions to protect the minor’s life, health, physical and mental integrity, and safety. In addition, police officers must report evidence of trafficking in persons, sexual exploitation, drug trafficking, or drug use to protect the minor's safety, privacy, and identity.22  Finally, police officers must inform the minors of the steps to be followed, the process that will be carried out, the participants, and the rights of the unaccompanied or separated minor.23 Finally, once a structured interview has been carried out with the minor, the first reception stage will culminate with the referral of the minor to the corresponding family court judge. Further, the police officers must send all the information they have to the family court.24  B. Judicial Stage  Once the case is received by the corresponding family court, it will adopt all the necessary protection measures for the unaccompanied or separated minor.25  A guardian ad litem will be appointed,26 that is, a lawyer to defend the interests of the minor during the judicial proceedings. An immediate hearing must be held to adopt preventive measures and  17 Supreme Court, supra note 2, p. 21. 18 Id. 19 Id. 20 Id. at 22. 21 Id. 22 Id. 23 Id. at 24. 24 Id. at 32. 25 Id. at 33. 26 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Chile The Law Library of Congress 35 protect the minor, who must also be interviewed personally by the family court judge.27 The family court judge shall determine whether, in addition to the other protection measures that he may decree, international protection is necessary28 and order the issuance of personal identity documents to the minor.29  Finally, the possibility of family reunification with the minor’s parents will be evaluated,30 except when the children's best interests require prolonging the separation.31 To expedite this measure regarding family reunification outside Chile, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs must have available information regarding the Memoranda of Understanding –  if any – with the minor's country of origin.32 If reunification is not possible, the judge must determine the form of alternative care to the family environment,33 always considering the child's best interests.34   C. The Follow-Up to the Protection Measures Adopted  To ensure effective compliance with the protection measures adopted by the family judge, the Protocol establishes Observation and Compliance Centers, which, in coordination with the Supreme Court, are responsible for monitoring measures to protect the rights of unaccompanied or separated minors,35 according to the guidelines established in Act 37-2014,36 and the resolution of the Supreme Court of March 29, 2019, in AD-1251-2018.37  27 Id. at 34. 28 Id. at 37. 29 Id. at 40. 30 Id. 31 Id. 32 Id. 33 Id. at 41. 34 Id. 35 Id. at 43. 36 Corte Suprema, Acta 37-2014, Mar. 14, 2014, https://perma.cc/A6M3-PAYK. 37 Corte Suprema, Tribunal Pleno, AD-1251-2018, Mar. 29, 2019, https://perma.cc/3PEA-8P3D. \fThe Law Library of Congress 36 European Union Jenny Gesley Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY The European Union’s (EU) asylum legislation contains special provisions for minors and unaccompanied minors to protect the best interests of the child. Protecting the best interests of the child, which includes in particular respecting the principle of family unity, must be a primary consideration of the EU Member States when applying and implementing the legislation. This principle is derived from the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union and is reiterated in the EU asylum legislation. Unaccompanied minors are generally considered a vulnerable group and are therefore entitled to special safeguards. Member States are encouraged to prioritize asylum applications of unaccompanied minors.    While their application is pending, unaccompanied minors must have access to education, employment, vocational training, and healthcare. As soon as possible, Member States must appoint a legal representative for unaccompanied minors to navigate the process. Likewise, once their application has been approved, Member States must appoint a legal guardian, and the minor must have access to employment, education, procedures for recognition of qualifications, social welfare, healthcare, and accommodation under the same conditions as nationals.    The detention of unaccompanied minors must be reserved to exceptional circumstances, and they must be released as soon as possible. Return decisions must take due account of the best interests of the child. Practices with regard to returning unaccompanied minors vary from Member State to Member State, with some granting them a legal right to stay and others not returning them in practice.    Family reunification must be taken into account with regard to which Member State is responsible for processing an asylum application of an unaccompanied minor. If an unaccompanied minor is returned, Member States must ensure that he or she will be returned to a member of his or her family, a guardian, or an adequate reception facility in the country of return. If an unaccompanied minor is granted a right to stay, Member States must authorize the entry and residence of first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line.   I. Introduction  The European Union (EU) is tasked with establishing a Common European Asylum System (CEAS).1 To that end, several legislative instruments have been adopted that establish, among other things, common procedures, a uniform status for refugees and people who have been awarded subsidiary and temporary protection, criteria and mechanisms for determining which  1 Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), art. 67, para. 2, art. 78, 2016 O.J.

Statistics  According to Eurostat, 166,760 out of 535,000 first-time asylum applicants in the EU and European Free Trade Association (EFTA)3 countries in 2021 were under the age of 18, representing 31.2% of the total number of first-time asylum applicants. On average, between 2011 and 2021, 15.3% of the total number of first-time asylum applicant children were unaccompanied minors. In 2021, the number was 13.9%. The majority of children in 2021 came from Syria (26.1.%), Afghanistan (21.5%), and Iraq (6.1.%), whereas most unaccompanied minors came from Afghanistan (53%), Syria (16.3%), and Bangladesh (5.8%). In general, the approval rate for children is 1.3 times higher than for adults for first instance decisions.4   B. Overview of the Legal Framework  The EU’s asylum legislation contains special provisions for minors and unaccompanied minors to protect the best interests of the child. Protecting the best interests of the child, which includes in particular respecting the principle of family unity, must be a primary consideration of the EU Member States when applying and implementing the legislation. EU legislation either applies directly in the EU Member States in the case of regulations or must be implemented by the Member States in the case of directives.5   • The Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter) explicitly mentions the rights of the child in article 24, in particular that the child’s best interests must be a primary consideration.6 The EU Charter generally binds the institutions, bodies, offices, and agencies of the EU and applies to the Member States only when they are implementing EU law.7 It has the same legal status as the EU Treaties.8 As such, it has to be taken into account when applying and interpreting the EU asylum legislation. • The Dublin III Regulation of the EU, which establishes the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application, applies  2 TFEU, art. 78, para. 2. 3 EFTA is an intergovernmental organization made up of Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland.

It contains an exception for unaccompanied minors with regard to which Member State is in charge of processing the application.9  • The 2001 Temporary Protection Directive sets up special procedures to deal with mass influxes of displaced persons.10 It was triggered for the first time on March 4, 2022, due to the mass inflow of persons fleeing Ukraine as a result of Russia’s invasion.11 The directive provides specific rules for unaccompanied minors in article 13, paragraph 4, and article 16. • The Qualification Directive provides common grounds to grant international protection in the EU.12 It mentions unaccompanied minors in section 20, paragraph 3 as a vulnerable group. Article 31 specifically deals with unaccompanied minors. • The Asylum Procedures Directive creates a common asylum system in the EU.13 Article 25 deals with procedural guarantees for unaccompanied minors. • The Reception Conditions Directive establishes common standards of conditions of living for asylum seekers.14 It addresses unaccompanied minors in articles 11, 21, 22, 23, and 24. • The Return Directive lays down common standards and procedures for returning illegal immigrants.15 Article 10 focuses on the return and removal of unaccompanied minors, whereas article 17 deals with detention of minors and families.  In 2016, the European Commission published several proposals to reform the CEAS to address the problem of unequal burden sharing and to promote solidarity among the Member States. However, the reforms did not receive the necessary support and are currently on hold.16 In 2020, the European Commission therefore proposed a “New Pact on Migration and Asylum,” which, among other things, contains several provisions that address the situation of unaccompanied minors, such as strengthening the guardianship system.17   II. Defining Unaccompanied Minors  The Dublin III Regulation of the EU establishes the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an asylum application and is directly applicable in the EU Member States without any implementing national legislation needed. It defines “minor” as  9 Consolidated Version of Dublin III Regulation, 2013 O.J. (L 180) 31, https://perma.cc/93EW-G63Q.  10 Temporary Protection Directive, 2001 O.J.

III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  A.  Dublin III Regulation  In general, the Dublin III Regulation states that the criteria for establishing responsibility to process an asylum application are, in hierarchical order, family considerations, recent possession of a visa or residence permit in a Member State, and whether the applicant has entered the EU irregularly or regularly.19 For irregular entries, the Member State where the applicant first enters is responsible and not the one where the application was lodged.20 Article 8 describes the special procedure that has to be followed to determine which Member State is responsible for the asylum application of an unaccompanied minor. It states that, as an exception, in the case of unaccompanied minors, the Member State responsible is the one where a family member or a sibling of the unaccompanied minor is legally present, or in the absence of a family member or sibling, where a relative, meaning an aunt, uncle, or grandparent, is legally present. If they are present in more than one Member State, the best interests of the child must be the guiding principle in making a decision.21 In the absence of a family member, a sibling, or a relative, the Member State responsible is the one where the unaccompanied minor has lodged an asylum application.22  B.  The Concept of Safe Country of Origin and Safe Third Country  The Asylum Procedures Directive deals with the concept of safe country of origin and safe third country and how it influences an asylum application. Member States are authorized to designate certain countries as safe countries of origin.23 Such a designation must be based “on a range of sources of information, including in particular information from other Member States, EASO [European Asylum Support Office], UNHCR [United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees], the Council of Europe and other relevant international organisations.”24 According to the annex of the Asylum Procedures Directive, “a country is considered as a safe country of origin where, on the basis of the legal situation, the application of the law within a democratic system and the general political circumstances, it can be shown that there is generally and consistently no  18 Dublin III Regulation, art. 2(i) & (j). 19 Id. arts. 7-15. 20 Id. art. 13. 21 Id. art. 8, para. 3. 22 Id. art. 8, para. 4. 23 Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 37. 24 Id. art. 37, para. 3. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: European Union The Law Library of Congress 40 persecution as defined in Article 9 of Directive 2011/95/EU [Qualification Directive], no torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment and no threat by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or internal armed conflict.”  Article 36 of the Asylum Procedures Directive provides that the application of the concept of safe country of origin to an individual applicant may only take place if the applicant is a national of that country or is stateless and was formerly habitually resident in that country. Furthermore, the safe third country concept may only be applied if in the third country concerned  (a) life and liberty are not threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion; (b) there is no risk of serious harm as defined in Directive 2011/95/EU; (c) the principle of non-refoulement in accordance with the Geneva Convention is respected; (d) the prohibition of removal, in violation of the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as laid down in international law, is respected; and (e) the possibility exists to request refugee status and, if found to be a refugee, to receive protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention.25  Member States must lay down national rules on the application of this concept.26 They may provide that no or no full examination of the asylum application and of the safety of the applicant will take place in cases where a competent authority has established that the applicant is seeking to enter or has entered illegally from a European safe third country.27  With regard to unaccompanied minors, the Asylum Procedures Directive provides that the guiding principle in applying the directive must be the best interests of the child.28 In particular, using an accelerated procedure or an asylum procedure at the border or in transit zones is only possible if the unaccompanied minor comes from a safe country of origin, among other reasons.29 Furthermore, the Member State may only consider the application of an unaccompanied minor to be inadmissible if a country that is not an EU Member State is a safe third country for the minor.30  C. Other Restrictions  In addition, authorities may use an accelerated procedure or an asylum procedure at the border or in transit zones for unaccompanied minors if the applicant has introduced a subsequent inadmissible application for international protection, may for serious reasons be considered a danger to the national security or public order of the Member State, has been forcibly expelled for serious reasons of public security or public order under national law, has misled the  25 Id. art. 38, para. 1. 26 Id. art. 38, para. 2. 27 Id. art. 39. 28 Id. art. 25, para. 6. 29 Id. 30 Id. art. 25, para. 6(c). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: European Union The Law Library of Congress 41 authorities by presenting false documents, or, in bad faith, has destroyed or disposed of an identity or travel document that would have helped establish his or her identity or nationality.31  IV.  Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  The Reception Conditions Directive defines an “applicant with special reception needs” as a vulnerable person, who is in need of special guarantees in order to benefit from the rights and comply with the obligations provided for in the directive.32 Article 21 contains a non-enumerative list of vulnerable persons, among them, minors and unaccompanied minors. Special provisions to protect this group are therefore in place, and a determination must be made within a reasonable period of time after an application has been lodged.33 Member States are encouraged to prioritize asylum applications of unaccompanied minors.34 In general, the best interests of the minor must be the primary consideration when implementing the law.35 Member States must “ensure a standard of living adequate for the minor’s physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development.”36 The Asylum Procedure Directive also sets out special procedural guarantees for unaccompanied minors.37   A. Visas  In general, while an asylum application is pending, applicants are allowed to remain in the Member State until a decision is made. That right does not constitute an entitlement to a residence permit.38 However, Member States may grant temporary residence permits, certificates, or registration cards to unaccompanied minors while their application is pending. The practice varies from Member State to Member State. A 2015 report by the European Migration Network found that 15 Member States granted temporary residence permits, certificates, or registration cards to unaccompanied minors during the assessment of their applications.39 In addition, if the 2001 Temporary Protection Directive is triggered, unaccompanied minors are granted an EU harmonized protection status for a period of one year and must be provided with the necessary residence permits and visas, including transit visas, for the period of their stay.40  31 Id. art. 25, para. 6(a),(b). 32 Reception Conditions Directive, art. 2(k). 33 Id. art. 22, para. 1. 34 Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 31, para. 7(b). 35 Reception Conditions Directive, art. 23, para. 1. 36 Id. 37 Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 25. 38 Id. art. 9, para. 1. 39 European Migration Network, Policies, Practices and Data on Unaccompanied Minors in the EU Member States and Norway 21 (May 2015), https://perma.cc/6SNJ-AUAK.

In addition, the United Kingdom, an EU Member State at the time, granted temporary permissions to unaccompanied minors to enter the country. 40 Temporary Protection Directive, arts. 4, 8. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: European Union The Law Library of Congress 42 Once an application is approved, a residence permit based on refugee status or subsidiary protection is issued, or, depending on national law, based on humanitarian grounds.41   B. Legal Representation  As soon as possible, Member States must appoint a legal representative for unaccompanied minors and inform them immediately of such an appointment.42 Again, the leading principle must be the best interests of the minor. The legal representative should generally remain the same during the asylum process to ensure the minor’s well-being and social development.43 The legal representative must inform and prepare the unaccompanied minor for the personal asylum interview and be present at the interview to ask questions and comments.44 However, if the unaccompanied minor will be 18 years old before an asylum decision at first instance is taken, the Member States are allowed to refrain from appointing a legal representative.45 Legal and procedural information must be provided free of charge to the unaccompanied minors and their legal representatives, in particular information on the procedure in the light of the applicant’s particular circumstances.46  C. Role of Child Protection Agencies  In general, unaccompanied minors who apply for asylum should be placed with adult relatives, a foster family, in accommodation centers with special provisions for minors, or in other suitable accommodations.47 Member States, with the assistance of international or other relevant organizations, must start tracing the members of the unaccompanied minor’s family as soon as possible after the application is lodged.48 Staff working with unaccompanied minors must receive continuous training concerning their needs.49  Furthermore, as mentioned, a representative must be appointed for an unaccompanied minor, who may be “a person or an organisation appointed by the competent bodies in order to assist and represent an unaccompanied minor in procedures provided for in this Directive with a view to ensuring the best interests of the child and exercising legal capacity for the minor where necessary.”50 In addition, once an asylum application of an unaccompanied minor has been approved, Member States must appoint a legal guardian or, where necessary, an organization  41 Qualification Directive, art. 24. 42 Reception Conditions Directive, art. 24, para. 1; Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 25, para. 1(a). 43 Id.  44 Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 25, para. 1(b). 45 Id. art. 25, para. 2. 46 Id. art. 25, para. 4. 47 Reception Conditions Directive, art. 24, para. 2. 48 Id. art. 24, para. 3. 49 Id. art. 24, para. 4. 50 Id. art. 2(j), 24; Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 2(n), 25. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: European Union The Law Library of Congress 43 responsible for the care and well-being of minors to represent the unaccompanied children.51 Such a legal guardian or representative must ensure that the minor’s needs are duly met.52  The national laws of the EU Member States can provide that a child protection agency is appointed as guardian for the unaccompanied minor, such as the local youth welfare office in Germany.53 The European Commission also recommends that appointed guardians and/or competent child protection authorities be involved in the assessment of the best interests of the child with regard to adopting a return decision.54  V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  A. Detention  The Reception Conditions Directive provides that the detention of unaccompanied minors must be reserved to exceptional circumstances and that they must be released as soon as possible.55 It is prohibited to detain them in a prison and together with adults. Instead, they should be housed in an institution with personnel and facilities that take into account the needs of persons their age.56 Detained minors in general must be able to engage in leisure activities, including play and recreational activities appropriate to their age.57  In addition, article 17 of the Return Directive deals with detention of unaccompanied minors and families with minors. Like the Reception Conditions Directive, it states that detention must be as short as possible and only used as a last resort.58 Member States must ensure that minors have access to basic education for the duration of their stay and can engage in leisure activities.59 If possible, unaccompanied minors must be held in institutions with personnel and facilities that take into account the needs of persons their age.60 Guiding principle for the detention of minors is again the best interests of the child.61     51 Qualification Directive, art. 31. 52 Id. art. 31, para. 2. 53 Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch [BGB], Jan. 2, 2002, Bundesgesetzblatt [BGBl.] I at 42, 2909; corrected in BGBl. 2003 I at 738, as amended, § 1774, https://perma.cc/UMW2-3AZR.  54 Eur.

Return  With regard to the return of minors, the CJEU has opined that when issuing a return decision, Member States “must . . . take due account of the best interests of the child.”62 Practices with regard to returning unaccompanied minors vary from Member State to Member State. A 2019 study from the European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights (FRA) found that some Member States, such as France and Italy, provide unaccompanied minors with a legal right to stay. Others do not provide them with such a legal right but do not enforce returns in practice.63  Before a return decision is issued, minors have a right to be heard. This right stems from the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) and the EU Charter and must be part of the assessment of the best interests of the child.64 The European Commission states in its non-legally binding Return Handbook that the measures adopted by Member States to ensure the right to be heard should be guided by the following key principles:  • expressing views is a choice and not an obligation;  • the right to be heard should not be subject to any age limits or other arbitrary restrictions, either in law or in practice;  • a minor should be heard in an environment that is appropriate to his/her needs;  • the means used to give effect to the right to be heard should be adapted to the level of understanding and ability to communicate and should take into account the circumstances of the case;  • in full consideration of the need to protect minors from harm, a minor should not be interviewed more often than necessary;  • facilitating the expression of views may require special measures for a minor in particularly vulnerable situations, including the provision of interpretation and translation services.65   The EU Return Directive lays down common standards and procedures for returning illegal immigrants.66 It reiterates the obligation of the Member States to take due account of the best interests of the child when implementing the directive.67 Article 10 focuses on the return and removal of unaccompanied minors. Member States must ensure that an unaccompanied minor will be returned to a member of his or her family, a guardian, or an adequate reception facility in the country of return. Furthermore, before issuing a return decision, assistance by “appropriate bodies” must be sought, such as legal or medical assistance from a governmental or non- 62 CJEU, C-82/16, K.A. and Others, ECLI:EU:C:2018:308, paras. 102, 103, 107, https://perma.cc/2LVZ-HD44.  63 European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights [FRA], Returning Unaccompanied Children: Fundamental Rights Considerations.

Joint return operations through charter flights, regardless of whether they are organised at a national level or coordinated by the European Coast and Border Guard Agency, should not include unaccompanied children. These operations are not suitable for this category of vulnerable persons. They can be traumatising for the children, who may have to witness the use of force and means of restraint against adult returnees, without having the support of their parents to deal with such experiences.70  VI.  Resettlement and Integration Programs  A. Relocation and Resettlement  There are three main types of relocation arrangements within the EU, which mainly concerned the transfer of asylum seekers from France, Greece, Italy, and Malta to other EU Member States during the height of the refugee crisis in 2015 and in the following years. These are the European Emergency Relocation Mechanism, bilateral arrangements for unaccompanied children, and voluntary relocation for people rescued at sea.71  The European Emergency Relocation Mechanism was set up in 2015 as a temporary relocation scheme under article 78, paragraph 3 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU).72 It applied to 40,000 refugees that arrived either in Italy (24,000) or Greece (16,000) from September 16, 2015, until September 17, 2017, as well as to applicants having arrived on the territory of those Member States from August 15, 2015, onwards.73 These applicants were relocated from Italy and Greece to other Member States. The Member State of relocation received a lump sum of 6,000 euros (about US$6,573) per person.74 Priority was to be given to vulnerable applicants, such as unaccompanied minors, and the best interests of the child had to be a primary  68 Id. art. 10, para. 1; Return Handbook, supra note 54, at 46. 69 Return Handbook, supra note 54, at 47. 70 FRA, supra note 63, at 30. 71 FRA, Relocating Unaccompanied Children: Applying Good Practices to Future Schemes 7 (2020), https://perma.cc/4MBU-VBBV.  72 Council Decision (EU) 2015/1523, 215 O.J. (L 239) 146, https://perma.cc/XV79-5HZU. On September 22, 2015, the Council adopted a second emergency relocation decision to relocate a further 120,000 people seeking international protection from Italy and Greece to other Member States.

The United Kingdom, an EU Member State at the time, amended its Immigration Act to allow for the relocation of 480 unaccompanied minors.78   Lastly, between 2018 and 2019, some Member States voluntarily relocated refugees rescued at sea from Italy and Malta, including 46 unaccompanied minors.79  However, the FRA reported that the number of relocation pledges were low, because Member States found   complying with their [unaccompanied minors’] protection safeguards and special reception needs was one of the obstacles to relocation. Notably, Member States’ authorities, and other parties involved, did not have enough facilities and staff to provide children with appropriate care and accommodation and to ensure that safeguards were in place on time, such as guardianship, best interests’ assessment, providing legal advice and child-friendly information. Although important for the individual children who were protected, the schemes adopted so far are not sufficient to respond to the protection needs of unaccompanied children.80  B. Integration  Unaccompanied minors that have applied for international protection in an EU Member State must have access to education, employment, vocational training, and healthcare.81 Likewise, once their application has been approved, they must be granted access to employment, education, procedures for recognition of qualifications, social welfare, healthcare, and accommodation under the same conditions as nationals.82 Primary consideration must be the best interests of the child.83   75 Id. art. 5, para. 3, art. 6, para. 1, recital 27. 76 FRA, supra note 71, at 6. 77 Dublin III Regulation, art. 17, para. 2. 78 FRA, supra note 71, at 6. 79 Id.; Joint Declaration of Intent on a Controlled Emergency Procedure—Voluntary Commitments by Member States for a Predictable Temporary Solidarity Mechanism (Malta Declaration) (Sept. 23, 2019), StateWatch.org, https://perma.cc/5RCW-KYVK.  80 FRA, supra note 71, at 6. 81 Reception Conditions Directive, arts. 14-16, 19. 82 Qualification Directive, arts. 26-30, 32. 83 Id. art. 20, para. 5. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: European Union The Law Library of Congress 47 VII.  Family Reunification  Article 6, paragraph 3(a) of the Dublin III Regulation obligates EU Member States to take family reunification possibilities into account with respect to all procedures provided for in the regulation. As mentioned, in the case of unaccompanied minors, the Member State primarily responsible for processing the asylum application is the one where a family member or a sibling of the unaccompanied minor is legally present, or, in the absence of a family member or sibling, where a relative, meaning an aunt, uncle, or grandparent, is legally present.84   Likewise, the Return Directive obligates Member States to ensure that an unaccompanied minor will be returned to a member of his or her family, a guardian, or an adequate reception facility in the country of return.85 Member States must, therefore, in a first step determine the identity and nationality of the unaccompanied minor and trace family members.86 Family tracing must start as soon as possible. Consular services, liaison officers, such as those working under the EU Return Liaison Officers program, child protection bodies, international organizations, and NGOs operating within the European Reintegration Network program in the country of return should be involved, among others, to facilitate the efforts.87   Lastly, for unaccompanied minors whose asylum application has been approved, the Family Reunification Directive sets out the conditions for family reunification of third country nationals legally residing in an EU Member State.88 The objective of family reunification is to “preserve the family unit” and “facilitat[e] the integration of third country nationals in the Member State.”89 With regard to unaccompanied minors, it provides that the Member States must authorize the entry and residence of first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line,90 and they may authorize the entry and residence of a minor’s legal guardian or any other member of the family, where the minor has no relatives in the direct ascending line or such relatives cannot be traced.91  84 Dublin III Regulation, art. 8. 85 Return Directive, art. 10, para. 2. 86 Return Handbook, supra note 54, at 47. 87 Id.; FRA, supra note 63, at 24. 88 Family Reunification Directive, 2003 O.J.

Finland has ratified the Convention on the Rights of the Child, and all decisions pertaining to unaccompanied minors must be made with the best interest of the child.     Finland may dismiss an unaccompanied minor’s application under the Dublin III regulation for processing in a different member state when the applicant has family members in a different member state or when he or she has received protection in a different member state. Finland does not have a set list of safe counties but will determine whether the unaccompanied minor is arriving from a safe country in each individual instance.   While applications are pending, unaccompanied minors have a right to housing, funding, health care, education (including vocational training), and language training. If the minor is above 15 years old, he or she also has a right to work. Unaccompanied minors also have a right to court appointed legal representative that protects their interests throughout the application process.   Unaccompanied minors are eligible for repatriation funding provided a legal guardian or parent meet them upon their return to their home country. Finland cannot detain a person less than 15 years old. Detaining a minor who is 15 years old or older must be absolutely necessary and less invasive alternatives, such as requiring that the minor report to its housing unit several times a day, must be considered.    When an application is granted, a special integration plan is drawn up for unaccompanied minors by their local municipality.     Unaccompanied minors can sponsor their parents and siblings for family reunification without meeting a financial obligation requirement (after they have turned 18), provided the application for family unification is made within three months of the applicant receiving his or her residency permit.      \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Finland The Law Library of Congress 49 I.  Introduction  Finland is a European Union (EU) member state bound by EU regulations and required to implement EU Directives into national law.1 This includes the Dublin III Regulation2 and the Asylum Procedures Directive,3 the Return Directive,4 and the Temporary Protection Directive.5  A. Statistics  Finland, like most of the EU member countries, saw a spike in asylum applications from unaccompanied minors in 2015.6 In 2015, Finland received applications from 3,014 applicants; up from 196 in 2014.7 In 2022, Finland received 246 applications from unaccompanied minors, which was an increase from 136 in 2021.8 According to a Nordic Council survey, more than 90% of unaccompanied minors were granted international protection in 2016.9  Between December 2021 and April 2023, the top five most common countries of citizenship among unaccompanied minors were Somalia, Afghanistan, Ukraine, Syrian Arab Republic, and Ethiopia.10  B.

Defining Unaccompanied Minors  Finnish law defines a minor as a person who has not yet turned 18 years old.16 An unaccompanied minor is a minor who arrives without a parent or legal guardian.17  In Finland, determining the age of the asylum seeker is based on the documents presented by the applicant, or through a medical examination when there are obvious reasons to suspect that the applicant may be above 18 years old.18 The medical examination is carried out by the Institute for Health and Welfare, at the request of the Finnish Immigration Service, by examining the person’s teeth and wrist bones.19 While the examination must be preceded by a written consent from the minor or the party representing him or her, a result of refusing to undergo the examination is that the person is considered above 18 years old.20      12 Laki kansainvälistä suojelua hakevan vastaanotosta sekä ihmiskaupan uhrin tunnistamisesta ja auttamisesta (Act on the Reception of Persons Seeking International Protection and Identification of and Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking) (2011/746), https://perma.cc/J44K-R86F (in Finnish), Lag om mottagande av personer som söker internationellt skydd och om identifiering av och hjälp till offer för människohandel (FFS 2011/746), https://perma.cc/T53B-6FHS (in Swedish). 13  Laki kotoutumisen edistämisestä (Act on Promotion of Integration) (2010/386), https://perma.cc/LRN9-CZWA (in Finnish), Lagen om främjande av integration (FFS 2010/1386), https://perma.cc/4AB2-VYUA (in Swedish).

Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  A. Dublin III Regulation   As a member of the EU, Finland is bound by the Dublin III Regulation, which determines where an application for asylum should be processed.21 The Finnish Immigration Service may dismiss an application for asylum in the following cases:   • You have arrived from a safe country where you have been granted asylum or subsidiary protection or otherwise sufficient protection, and you may be returned to this country (safe country of asylum). • You have arrived from a safe country where you could have been granted asylum or subsidiary protection or otherwise sufficient protection, you have sufficient ties to that country and you may be returned there (safe third country). • You can be sent to another country that is responsible for examining your asylum application according to the Dublin Regulation (the Dublin procedure). • You have received international protection in another EU Member State (the Dublin procedure). • You have made a subsequent application that does not contain any new grounds that would influence our decision on your matter.22  B. Safe Countries List   Finland does not provide a safe country list, but the Finnish Migration Service typically considers all EU member states to be safe countries.23 In addition, Finland considers a third country a safe country when “there is no risk of persecution or serious violations of human rights” and will assess and determine third countries to be safe countries by examining the following questions:24  • Does the state have a stable and democratic social system? • Does the state have an independent and impartial judicial system and does the administration of justice meet the requirements for a fair trial? • Has the state signed the main international conventions on human rights and does the state adhere to them? • Have there been serious violations of human rights in the state?25  The EU Asylum Procedures Directive does not prohibit Finland from using expedited processing for unaccompanied minors.      21 Consolidated Version of Dublin III Regulation, 2013 O.J.

Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A. Travel Documents  While the application process is pending, unaccompanied minors have a right to travel documents, including alien passports.26   B. Legal Representation  Upon arrival in Finland, all unaccompanied minors have a right to a legal representative that protect the minor’s interests.27 The legal representative is assigned by the local district court.28 When the minor turns 18 years old and gains legal capacity, the legal representative relationship is automatically severed.29   C. Role of Child Protection Agencies  In addition to the individual legal representative, the Ombudsman for Children in Finland, an independent authority under the Ministry of Justice, is responsible for protecting the interest of the child, including ensuring that Finland adopts legislation that considers the best interest of the child.30  D. Housing  Upon arriving in Finland, unaccompanied minors will be housed in special group homes, separate from general arrival centers and adult asylum seekers.31   When the minor is granted protected status, he or she is eligible for special housing.32 These special measures may continue until the minor is 25 years old.33 Unaccompanied minors who are  26 134 § Alien Act. 27 39 § Act on the Reception of Persons Seeking International Protection and Identification of and Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking.

While Application is Being Processed  While the application for being processed, the unaccompanied minor has a right to go to school, work if she or he is above 15 years old, receive language training, receive health care, and receive a daily grant for his or her expenses.35   V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  There are two detention centers in Finland, one in Helsinki and one in Joutseno.36 Deportation of unaccompanied minors whose applications are denied is carried out on a voluntary basis, where the minor voluntarily leaves. Deportation against a minor’s wishes will typically not take place.37  A. Detention of Minors   Minors who are 15 years or older can be detained.38 Minors who are not yet 15 years old cannot be detained.39 In lieu of detaining a minor who is 15 years old, he or she can be required to report to his or her group home up to four times a day.40 The decision must be based on the needs of the child and not exceed what is required.41  B. Repatriation of Minors  Finland provides financial assistance for unaccompanied minors who wish to return to their home countries.42 Repatriation requires that the parent(s) or legal guardian(s) of the minor can meet the child upon arrival.43     34 Accommodation of an Unaccompanied Minor Asylum Seeker, Migri, https://perma.cc/ZLG4-CFHF.  35 20, 21, 26, 29 §§ Act on the Reception of Persons Seeking International Protection and Identification of and Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking. 36 Förvarstagande, Migri, https://perma.cc/S3NS-C8BS.  37 Id. 38 122 § Alien Act. 39 Id. 40 120 § Alien Act.  41 Id.  42 31 § Act on the Reception of Persons Seeking International Protection and Identification of and Assistance to Victims of Human Trafficking.

Resettlement and Integration Programs  A. Resettlement   Finland participates in resettlement programs for refugees.44 In 2023, Finland has committed to receive 1,050 quota refugees through the UN resettlement scheme.45  Finland committed to receive about 3,000 persons as part of the European Emergency Resettlement Scheme.46 In 2020, 49 unaccompanied minors arrived in Finland from Greece as part of the voluntary resettlement program.47 In total, 126 unaccompanied minors arrived from Greece in 2020 and 2021.48   B. Integration Program  For unaccompanied children who receive a residency permit, an integration plan is always developed by the municipality where he or she lives.49 The plan is developed together with the minor and his or her legal representation.50 The best interest of the child must always be considered, and the child should be heard in all matters relevant to the child.51  VII.  Family Reunification  Unaccompanied minors who have received residency based on international protection in Finland are eligible for family reunification without needing to prove that they can financially support their family members.52 The definition of a family member is found in section 37 of the Alien Act, and defines a parent as a family member when a child who is not yet 18 sponsors the parent.53 As a result, historically an unaccompanied minor could only sponsor his or her parents if awarded a residency permit before turning 18 years old. A new provision, section 38 of the Alien Act, was introduced in 2022, which also allows persons who have turned 18 to sponsor  44 Resettlement of Quota Refugees is One Way of Helping the Most Vulnerable, Ministry of the Interior, https://perma.cc/L8QB-EWRU.  45 Asylum in Finland - Quota Refugees, Migri, https://perma.cc/R45B-865F.

An unaccompanied minor is a foreign child under the age of 18, who has arrived in France unaccompanied by one of the persons entrusted with legal custody or by a legal representative. The child protection services are responsible for welcoming the minor and taking him or her into their care.    The deportation of unaccompanied minors is prohibited under French law.     I.  Introduction  In 2021, 11,315 persons were placed under the status of unaccompanied minor, and 94.8% of them were boys.1 As shown in the graph below, the Covid-19 crisis led to a significant decrease in the number of unaccompanied minors in France. The slow rebound in 2021 is related to the gradual lifting of border restrictions.2   Number of persons placed under the status of unaccompanied minor in France from 2016 to 20213   1 Ministère de la Justice, Direction de la Projection Judiciaire de la Jeunesse, Mission Mineurs Non-Accompagnés, Rapport Annuel d’Activité 2021, at 7, https://perma.cc/487C-E2A7.  2 Id. 3 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: France The Law Library of Congress 57 The age of unaccompanied minors varies, with the majority being over 16, as shown on the following chart.

These regulations will be cited in this report. In the same way, several actors are involved in the care of unaccompanied minors. This report will present them.   II.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  France has ratified the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which requires states to grant special protection and assistance to children temporarily or permanently deprived of their family environment.6   Under the European Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of Europe, an unaccompanied minor is   a minor who arrives on the territory of the Member States unaccompanied by an adult responsible for him or her whether by law or by the practice of the Member State concerned, and for as long as he or she is not effectively taken into the care of such a person; it includes a minor who is left unaccompanied after he or she has entered the territory of the Member States.7   The Member States of the European Union have the responsibility to protect any child in a situation of minority and isolation.   In France, minors are individuals of either sex under the age of 18.8 Regarding the notion of isolation, a 2016 Government order states that the person is considered to be isolated when no adult is legally responsible for him or her on the national territory or effectively takes charge of him or her and shows his or her willingness to be entrusted with the child on a long-term basis, in particular by referring the matter to the competent judge.9  Before 2016, French law used the terminology mineurs isolés (isolated minors). However, the notion of isolation was too restrictive and only referred to the exercise of legal custody over a minor.10 Since 2016, French law uses the expression “unaccompanied minors.” The notion of accompaniment is broader and refers to the fact that the minor is not accompanied by an adult who cares for him or her.11   6 United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, art. 20, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3, https://perma.cc/EE3T-BB2R.  7 Directive 2011/95/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 13 December 2011 on standards for the qualification of third-country nationals or stateless persons as beneficiaries of international protection, for a uniform status for refugees or for persons eligible for subsidiary protection, and for the content of the protection granted (recast), art 2, https://perma.cc/L2RN-SCE3.  8 Code civil (Civil Code), art. 388, https://perma.cc/CK7R-YFWP. 9 Arrêté du 17 novembre 2016 pris en application du décret n° 2016-840 du 24 juin 2016 relatif aux modalités de l’évaluation des mineurs privés temporairement ou définitivement de la protection de leur famille, art. 1, https://perma.cc/U8XM-3JA6.  10 Défenseur des Droits de la République Française, Rapport – Les Mineurs Non Accompagnés au Regard du Droit 6 (2022), https://perma.cc/P9KP-SPZR.  11 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: France The Law Library of Congress 59  Unaccompanied minors do not have their own legal status. They are at the crossroads of the law on foreigners and the child protection system, which does not impose any nationality requirement.12  III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  Unaccompanied minors may apply for asylum. The country in which they may do so varies.  A. Unaccompanied Minors with Family Members in one of the EU Member States  Under the Dublin III EU Regulation, the Member State responsible for the asylum application of the minor is the one in which his or her family members (father, mother, siblings, uncles, aunts), or an adult responsible for the minor, are legally present, provided that this is in his or her best interests.13 States must take the necessary measures to identify family members.14  Such family reunification must always be in the child’s best interests. Thus, a child cannot be transferred if the identified parent cannot take care of him or her, or if there is a risk of the minor being a victim of human trafficking.15   B. Unaccompanied Minors with no Family Members or Relatives in one of the Member States  If the minor has no family members or close relatives in the territory of a Member State of the European Union, the state responsible is the last state in which he or she applied for international protection, i.e., the state in which he or she is located, provided that this protects his or her best interests.16 In the case of multiple applications in several Member States, the Court of Justice of the European Union has ruled that the Member State responsible for the asylum case is the last country where an application was submitted.17  If the minor applies for asylum in France, the Office Français de Protection des Réfugiés et Apatrides (French Office for the Protection of Refugees and Stateless Persons), or Ofpra, will be responsible for reviewing his or her file. Ofpra is an établissement public administratif (French government  12 France Terre d’Asile, L’accueil et la prise en charge des mineurs isolés étrangers en France (2017), https://perma.cc/Q9NZ-FLB7. 13 Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013, establishing the criteria and mechanisms for determining the Member State responsible for examining an application for international protection lodged in one of the Member States by a third-country national or a stateless person (recast), art. 8(1), https://perma.cc/4W2P-FZG8.  14 Directive 2013/33/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013, laying down standards for the reception of applicants for international protection (recast), art. 24(3), https://perma.cc/BB6R-AWSW.  15 Id. art. 23(2)(c).  16 See Regulation No. 604/2013, art. 8(4). 17 CJEU, 6 June 2013, MA, BT, DA v.

Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A. Visas  French law only requires persons over the age of 18 to have a valid residence permit.20 Minors are therefore not subject to any requirement regarding the legality of their entry or residence and cannot personally be subject to a removal order in principle.21  B. Role of Child Protection Agencies  Upon their arrival in France, unaccompanied minors are placed under the care of the Aide Sociale à l’Enfance (ASE) (French child protection agency). This institution’s mission is to prevent the difficulties that minors temporarily or permanently deprived of the protection of their families may encounter and to ensure their care.22  The process starts with a first interview to assess the minor’s situation.23 If the person is recognized as an unaccompanied minor within five days, or if the assessment has not been completed within five days, the ASE must report the presence of the young person to the procureur de la République (public prosecutor), who may issue an order to extend the delay and put the minor under the of protection of the ASE.24  If the identity documents do not make it possible to establish minority, or if the young person has no documents, a social assessment will be initiated.25 The evaluation must be carried out by trained professionals and by a multidisciplinary team, in a language understood by the foreigner, or with the assistance of an interpreter.26 The assessor must be neutral and benevolent and conduct the assessment in conditions that guarantee the interests of the child.27 The assessor must analyze the coherence of the story collected during several interviews and compare the young  18 Loi n° 52-893 du 25 juillet 1952 relative au droit d'asile, art. 1, https://perma.cc/8SM3-YW9W.   19 Code de l'entrée et du séjour des étrangers et du droit d'asile (CESEDA) (Code of Entry and Residence of Foreigners and of the Right of Asylum), art.

Otherwise, he or she may challenge the decision refusing to recognize him or her as an unaccompanied minor in court.   C. Legal Representation  French law provides for two types of legal representation.   First, guardianship, which has two forms, as follows:  • guardianship referred to the childhood protection agency: this guardianship is delegated to the ASE for unaccompanied minors, French or foreign, with no family network; and • guardianship with a family council may be implemented when the minor has family members in France. In fact, this measure only concerns a small proportion of unaccompanied foreign minors. 31  Then, the delegation of parental authority where the persons who have legal custody rights over the minor delegate these rights. 32 Again, this measure may only apply in a limited number of instances.   V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  Unaccompanied minors cannot be deported and sent back to their country of origin.33      28 Id. 29 Loi n° 2016-297 relative à la protection de l’enfant, art. 43 (Mar. 14, 2016), https://perma.cc/9V8Z-62ND.  30 Ministère de la Justice, Note du 5 septembre 2018 relative á la situation des mineurs non accompagnés faisant l’objet de poursuites pénales, at 11, https://perma.cc/CG66-R6BS. 31 Civil Code, arts. 398 and 411.  32 Id. art. 377. 33 CESEDA, art. L. 631-4.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: France The Law Library of Congress 62 VI.  Resettlement and Integration Programs  Unaccompanied minors are granted several rights.  A. Health Care  The UN Convention on the Rights of the Child recognizes “the right of the child to the enjoyment of the highest attainable standard of health and to facilities for the treatment of illness and rehabilitation of health.”34 To have access to healthcare, minors must have health coverage. In France, minors are covered by the universal health protection (called PUma), managed by the Caisse Primaire d’Assurance Maladie (CPAM), the French system of social security.35  The performance of medical acts on a minor usually requires the consent of the persons having legal custody of the child. These persons must make the medical decisions concerning the minor, except in cases of emergency or express refusal on the part of the minor.36 In the case of unaccompanied minors, if the ASE has obtained guardianship or a delegation of parental authority for the minor, they will make these decisions. In the absence of guardianship or delegation of parental authority, the judge may also authorize, exceptionally and in the child's interest, the ASE to perform an act of parental authority, particularly in health-related matters.37  B. Education  The additional protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights states in article 2 that “no one shall be denied the right to education.”38 The right to education for all is enshrined in the French Constitution. Indeed, the 13th paragraph of the Preamble of the Constitution of 1946 provides that the Nation guarantees equal access of children and adults to education, professional training, and culture. The organization of free and secular public education at all levels is a duty of the State.39   The Ministry of Education reminded the public in a note that school is a right for all children residing on national territory, regardless of their nationality, their migratory status, or their previous background.40 The judge ensures compliance with these provisions. For instance, the  34 See Convention on the Rights of the Child, art. 24(1). 35 Ministère du travail, de l’emploi et de la santé, Circulaire ministérielle n° DSS/2A/2011/351 (Sept. 8, 2011), https://perma.cc/E5KH-QNPA.  36 Code de la santé publique (Public Health Code), arts.

VII.  Family Reunification  A. Family Members Eligible for Family Reunification  A minor who has obtained refugee status or the benefit of subsidiary protection, and on the condition that he or she is not married, may request to be joined by his or her parents, and other minor, unmarried children still dependent on their parents (i.e., brothers and sisters).42   To initiate this procedure, the identity of family members must first be declared to Ofpra when applying for asylum by entering their name, date, and place of birth on the Ofpra form.43 Family members who have not been declared at the time of filing the asylum application with Ofpra cannot benefit from family reunification. However, omissions or inaccuracies can be corrected later, provided they can be justified.44  Family reunion may be refused if:  • the presence of the family members in France would constitute a threat to public order; • it is established that they have committed serious offenses which justified the granting of asylum protection.45  B. Procedure  The parents of the unaccompanied minor refugee must apply for a long-stay visa with the French consular authorities in their country.46 The visa application must be filed for each family member who wishes to join the refugee. They must provide proof of the existence of a family link with the minor.47 They must present the foreign civil status documents, the civil status documents of the minor established by Ofpra, or, in the absence of these documents, elements establishing the  41 Conseil d’Etat, Decision n° 407355 (Feb. 15, 2017), https://perma.cc/B54C-7TCP.  42 CESEDA, art.

The parents of a minor who has been granted refugee status obtain a 10-year residence permit.51 If the child benefits from subsidiary protection, his or her parents will obtain a multiannual residence permit for a period of four years.52 This visa allows them to enter France legally.  If the visa application is denied, it is mandatory to file a prior administrative appeal to challenge the decision. This appeal must be made within thirty days following the notification of the visa refusal before the Commission de recours contre les décisions de refus de visa d’entrée en France (Commission of appeal against the decisions of refusal of entry visa in France) (CRRV).53 The CRRV may reject the appeal or recommend granting a visa, but the decision is taken by the Ministère de l’Intérieur (French equivalent of the State Department), which is not obliged to follow its opinion.54 If the CRRV rejects the appeal, it is possible to file an appeal with the Administrative Court of Nantes within two months of the notification of this decision.55  48 Id. 49 Id. art.

The best interests of the child must be the primary consideration for all matters regarding children. The German Asylum Act and the Residence Act provide rules for the admission of refugees and the handling of refugee claims in general. The Asylum Seeker Benefits Act provides that people with special needs, such as unaccompanied minors, are eligible to receive appropriate health care and related care, and the Eighth Book of the German Social Security Code contains a specific chapter on unaccompanied minors.    Once an unaccompanied minor arrives in Germany and is identified as such, he or she is taken into preliminary care by a youth welfare office. Once the appropriate youth welfare office has received him or her, the office has the power to place the minor with a suitable person, a suitable institution, or other suitable accommodation on a temporary basis. The office has the right and the duty to represent the unaccompanied minor while he or she is in preliminary care or regular care. A legal guardian, which can be the youth welfare office, must be appointed immediately after the unaccompanied minor has been taken into regular care.    Minors and families with minors should only be detained in exceptional circumstances and only for as long as necessary without endangering the well-being of the child. If unaccompanied minors are returned, the competent authority must ensure that they are returned to a family member, to a person having the right of care and custody, or to an appropriate reception center.    Unaccompanied minors of school age have a duty and a right to attend school in Germany. States offer various support measures, in particular language classes or special preparatory classes for migrant children.    The youth welfare office in charge of preliminary care of the unaccompanied minor must ascertain whether he or she has relatives in Germany or abroad and must work towards uniting the minor with a relative if this is in his or her best interests. If the unaccompanied minor applies for asylum, the application is to be processed by the EU Member State in which a family member or a sibling of the unaccompanied minor is legally present, or in the absence of such family member, where a relative is legally present. Furthermore, parents of unaccompanied minors who have been granted a residence title must be issued a residence permit to move to Germany.    \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Germany The Law Library of Congress 66 I. Introduction  As a Member State of the European Union (EU), the Dublin III Regulation, which establishes the criteria and mechanisms for determining the EU Member State responsible for examining an asylum application, is directly applicable in Germany.1 In addition, Germany is required to implement the EU asylum directives into national law. Directives are binding with regard to the result they set out to achieve; the means are up to the member states.2 The guarantees for minors codified in the EU asylum legislation must be respected by German authorities.3   A. Statistics  According to the German Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (Bundesamt für Migration und Flüchtlinge, BAMF), in 2022, Germany received a total of 244,132 asylum applications, made up of 217,774 first-time applications and 26,358 subsequent applications.4 Minors under 18 years made up 37.3% (81,232) of the total number of first-time asylum applicants.5 7,277 were unaccompanied minors.6 The majority of unaccompanied minors in 2022 came from Afghanistan (39.1%), Syria (38.1%), Turkey (5.1%), and Somalia (4.3%).7  B. Overview of the Legal Framework  Germany has ratified the Geneva Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees of 1951 (Refugee Convention) and the Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC), and has implemented certain EU asylum law requirements into German law.8 The CRC as well as the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter) provide that the best interests of the child must be the primary consideration for all matters regarding children.9 The 2013 EU Asylum Procedures Directive has not yet been transposed into German law, but has direct effect since the deadline for transposition passed on July 20, 2015.10 The EU’s Dublin III Regulation, which contains an exception for unaccompanied minors with regard to which Member State is in charge of  1 Consolidated Version of Dublin III Regulation, 2013 O.J.

Additionally, rules on asylum can be found in the Asylum Seeker Benefits Act (Asylbewerberleistungsgesetz, AsylbLG) and the Eighth Book of the German Social Security Code (Sozialgesetzbuch - Achtes Buch, SGB 8).14 The Asylum Seeker Benefits Act provides that people with special needs, such as unaccompanied minors, are eligible to receive appropriate health care and related care.15 The Eighth Book of the German Social Security Code contains a specific chapter on unaccompanied minors.16  II.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  German law defines a child as someone who has not reached the age of 14 and a juvenile as someone who is 14 but not yet 18 years old.17 They are considered unaccompanied minors when they arrive in Germany unaccompanied by a person responsible for their care or a legal guardian; this also applies in the event that they are married.18  III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  A. Dublin III Regulation  As mentioned, the EU Dublin III Regulation applies directly in Germany. Article 8 describes the special procedure that has to be followed to determine which Member State is responsible for the asylum application of an unaccompanied minor. It states that, as an exception to the general rule,  11 Consolidated Version of Dublin III Regulation, art. 8, 2013 O.J.

If they are present in more than one Member State, the best interests of the child must be the guiding principle in making a decision.19 In the absence of a family member, a sibling, or a relative, the Member State responsible is the one where the unaccompanied minor has lodged an asylum application.20  B. The Concept of Safe Country of Origin and Safe Third Country  Safe countries of origin are the Member States of the EU and the countries contained in annex II of the German Asylum Act.21 The list is reviewed every two years and can be amended by the federal government without the consent of the German Bundesrat.22 It currently lists eight countries.23 The designation as a safe country of origin allows the accelerated processing of applications from asylum seekers from these countries, because there is a presumption that the application is manifestly without merit.24 In such a case, the applicant has only one week to leave the country instead of the usual thirty days.25 There are no specific provisions with regard to unaccompanied minors. The 2013 EU Asylum Procedures Directive, which has direct effect in Germany, does not prohibit using an accelerated procedure or an asylum procedure at the border or in transit zones if the unaccompanied minor comes from a safe third country.26  IV.  Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A. Visas  In general, while an asylum application or an application for a residence title is pending, applicants are allowed to remain in Germany until a decision is made.27 In addition, if the EU’s Temporary Protection Directive—which creates procedures to address a mass influx of displaced persons—is triggered, unaccompanied minors are granted an EU harmonized protection status for a period of one year and must be provided with the necessary residence permits and visas, including transit visas, for the period of their stay.28  19 Id. art. 8, para. 3. 20 Id. art. 8, para. 4. 21 AsylG, § 29a, para. 2, annex II. 22 Id. § 29a, paras. 3, 4. 23 The countries are Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Ghana, Kosovo, Macedonia, Montenegro, Senegal, and Serbia.  24 AsylG, § 29a, para. 1, § 30a, para. 1. 25 Id. § 36, para. 1, § 38, para. 1. 26 Asylum Procedures Directive, art. 25, para. 6.

Role of Child Protection Agencies   1. Preliminary Care of the Unaccompanied Minor  Once an unaccompanied minor arrives in Germany and is identified as such, he or she is taken into preliminary care by the youth welfare office.29 The youth welfare office together with the unaccompanied minor must ascertain   • whether conducting the national distribution procedure (discussed below) would endanger the best interests of the child; • whether the unaccompanied minor has relatives in Germany or abroad; • whether the best interests of the child require jointly taking of siblings or other unaccompanied minors into care; • whether the health of the unaccompanied minor prevents performing the national distribution procedure within 14 days of the start of the preliminary care, based on a medical examination that must be performed.30  Regarding the national distribution procedure, the youth welfare office within seven working days must inform the competent state authority in charge of distributing unaccompanied minors in Germany that the minor was taken into preliminary care and whether he or she will participate in the distribution process.31 Unaccompanied minors are distributed among the different German states according to a quota system, the Königsteiner Schlüssel, to distribute the burden evenly.32 The competent state authority must notify the German Federal Office of Administration (Bundesverwaltungsamt, BVA) within three working days of the participation or nonparticipation of the unaccompanied minor in the distribution process.33  If the youth welfare office determines the unaccompanied minor should participate in the distribution process, it must ensure that the minor is accompanied by a qualified person to the local welfare office in charge of caring for the minor and that the local office receives all of the minor’s personal data immediately.34  If there is doubt as to the identity of the unaccompanied minor, the youth welfare office must perform identity verification measures without undue delay, such as taking photographs and fingerprints.35 For foreigners under 14, only photographs are taken.36 In addition, an age  29 SGB 8, § 42a, para. 1. 30 Id. § 42a, para. 2. 31 Id. § 42a, para. 4. 32 Id. §§ 42b, 42c. 33 Id. 34 Id. § 42a, para. 5. 35 Id. § 42a, para. 3a; AufenthG, § 49, paras. 8, 9. 36 AufenthG, § 49, paras. 8, 9. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Germany The Law Library of Congress 70 verification must be performed.37 If a medical examination is necessary for such verification, the youth welfare office must provide full information to the unaccompanied minor regarding the procedure, the potential consequences of the age determination, and the consequences of a refusal to have the examination performed.38  2. Regular Care of the Unaccompanied Minor  Once the youth welfare office in charge of taking regular care of the unaccompanied minor has been determined and has received him or her, the office has the power to place the minor with a suitable person, a suitable institution, or other suitable accommodation on a temporary basis.39 In addition, the youth welfare office must ensure the best interests of the child are met, including healthcare and monetary support.40   C. Legal Representation  The youth welfare office has the right and the duty to represent the unaccompanied minor in legal matters while he or she is in preliminary care.41 The minor must be involved in making decisions, and the presumed wishes of the legal guardian or caretaker must also be taken into account.42 Likewise, the youth welfare office in charge of the regular care of the unaccompanied minor is authorized to represent him or her, taking into account the presumed wishes of the legal guardian or caretaker.43 This includes, in particular, immediately submitting an application for asylum if the minor needs international protection.44 The minor must be involved.45  A legal guardian for the unaccompanied minor must be appointed immediately after the regular care has started.46 The local youth welfare office may be appointed as legal guardian.47 In 2015, the age of legal capacity to act in asylum and residence procedures was raised from sixteen to eighteen years, meaning that every foreigner under the age of 18 must have a legal guardian to act on his or her behalf and to handle the complex asylum procedure.48     37 SGB 8, § 42f. 38 Id. § 42f, para. 2. 39 Id. § 42, para. 1, sentence 2. 40 Id. § 42, para. 2, sentence 3. 41 Id. § 42a, para. 3. 42 Id. 43 Id. § 42, para. 2, sentence 4. 44 Id. § 42, para. 2, sentence 5. 45 Id. 46 Id. § 42, para. 3, sentence 4. 47 Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch [BGB], Jan. 2, 2002, BGBl.

Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  A. Detention  The Residence Act provides that minors and families with minors should only be detained in exceptional circumstances and only for as long as necessary without endangering the well-being of the child.49 In addition, the needs of persons their age must be taken into account, in accordance with article 17 of the EU Return Directive.50  B. Return  Unaccompanied minors who are determined to be ineligible for protection can either return to their country of origin voluntarily or they can be removed by the authorities (forced return). There are two programs for the voluntary return of foreigners that are open to unaccompanied minors in Germany: the Reintegration and Emigration Program for Asylum Seekers in Germany (REAG) and the Government Assisted Repatriation Program (GARP). The programs are organized and managed by the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) and provide applicants with organizational and financial support.51 A 2018 study by the European Migration Network reported that 80 unaccompanied minors departed with the REAG/GARP program in 2017 and 170 in 2016.52 In addition, several German states offer support for voluntary returns through various return programs.53   The German Residence Act only deals with the removal (forced return) of unaccompanied minors.54 It provides that the competent authority must ensure that unaccompanied foreign minors are returned to a family member, to a person having the right of care and custody, or to an appropriate reception center.55 If this cannot be ensured, the removal must be suspended. In 2022, 2,141 unaccompanied minors were returned following unauthorized entry at the border.56 Between 2019 and 2022, the total number was 3,294.57 Furthermore, 2,196 minors total were deported; however, the statistics do not differentiate between accompanied and unaccompanied minors.58  49 AufenthG, § 62, para. 1. 50 Id. § 62a, para. 3; Return Directive, 2008 O.J.

Resettlement and Integration Programs  A. Relocation and Resettlement  Between 2012 and 2014 on a pilot basis and since 2015 on a permanent basis, Germany has participated in resettlement programs.59 The program initially offered 500 spots per year. Since 2016, it is conducted within the framework of the EU resettlement program. In 2023, Germany will provide 6,500 spots for resettled refugees and for humanitarian purposes.60 The level of special protection needed must be a consideration in selecting people for resettlement, meaning priority is given to children, women, and old or sick people.61  Resettlement refugees are granted temporary residence permits after they enter Germany and do not need to apply for asylum.62 The Federal Office for Migration and Refugees coordinates the program and distributes the resettlement refugees among the states.63 In 2017, children under the age of 18 made up 46% of resettlement refugees.64  B. Integration  The German Basic Law (Grundgesetz, GG) places education within the competency of the 16 German states.65 The Federal Constitutional Court (Bundesverfassungsgericht, BVerfG) has interpreted article 7 (school system) as a duty to attend school. Furthermore, in 2021, the court found, for the first time, that children have a constitutional right to education, which is derived from article 2, paragraph 1 (free development of one’s personality) in conjunction with article 7, paragraph 1 of the Basic Law.66 Articles 2 and 7 are not limited to German nationals and therefore also apply to foreign unaccompanied children. However, the different German states regulate access to education differently. For example, in some German states compulsory education only  59 Resettlement und humanitäre Aufnahmen, Bundesministeriums des Innern und für Heimat [BMI], https://perma.cc/EYA5-4EJF.  60 Id.; Anordnung des Bundesministeriums des Innern und für Heimat für das Resettlement-Verfahren 2023 gemäß § 23 Abs. 4 des Aufenthaltsgesetzes (AufenthG) zur Aufnahme besonders schutzbedürftiger Flüchtlinge unterschiedlicher Staatsangehörigkeit oder staatenloser Flüchtlinge aus Ägypten, Jordanien, Kenia, Libanon, Libyen, und Pakistan sowie bis zu 50 besonders schutzbedürftiger Flüchtlinge aus weiteren Staaten, Feb. 15, 2023, at 1, https://perma.cc/P2BJ-S3KV.  61 Anordnung des BMI, supra note 60, at 3. 62 AufenthG, § 23, para. 4. 63 Id. § 75, no. 8. 64 Tatjana Baraulina & Maria Bitterwolf, Resettlement in Germany – What is the Programme for Particularly Vulnerable Refugees Accomplishing?

The state of Saarland, for example, offers one-year long preparatory classes to students with a migration background “to facilitate and accelerate their integration into the school” before they can attend regular classes.70 The focus is on learning the German language. The preparatory class generally consists of around eight students who speak the same or a different language.71 Classes in their native language are possible.72  Once unaccompanied minors are no longer subject to compulsory education, they may apply for vocational training or enter the general job market. The Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) offers a 26-week long career orientation for young refugees to provide them with   detailed insights into training occupations in the craft trades sector. Throughout the whole of the scheme, they learn specialist terminology and knowledge for the training occupation they aspire to enter and receive individual assistance from a project support worker. The “Career Orientation for Refugees” Programme takes place in workshops and at companies.73   This is part of the “Routes into training for refugees” program, which includes other measures offered by the BMBF, the Federal Employment Agency, and the German Confederation of Skilled Crafts to facilitate the integration of young refugees in Germany.74     67 Schulgesetz für Baden-Württemberg [SchG], Aug. 1, 1983, Gesetzblatt für Baden-Württemberg [GBl.] 1983, at 397, as amended, § 72, para. 1, sentence 3, https://perma.cc/Z6EK-QF33.

Family ReunificationThere are two types of family reunifications, one according to welfare law and one according to asylum and residence law. As mentioned, once an unaccompanied minor arrives in Germany and is identified as such, he or she is taken into (preliminary) care by the youth welfare office.75 The youth welfare office must ascertain whether the unaccompanied minor has relatives in Germany or abroad.76 If this is the case, the youth welfare office must work towards uniting the unaccompanied minor with the relative if this is in his or her best interests.77 The child must be given an opportunity to participate in the transfer and the decision to reunite the family.78 As also mentioned, if the unaccompanied minor applies for asylum, the EU Member State in charge of processing the asylum application is the one in which a family member or a sibling of the unaccompanied minor is legally present, or in the absence of a family member, where a relative is legally presents.79 Tracing the family of the unaccompanied minor is therefore a first step in determining the responsible Member State. Furthermore, parents of unaccompanied minors who have been granted certain residence titles listed in section 36 of the Residence Act must be issued a temporary residence permit to move to Germany.80 Other family members may be granted a temporary residence permit if it would otherwise constitute extraordinary hardship.81 The Federal Administrative Court (Bundesverwaltungsgericht, BVerwG) has opined that extraordinary hardship means  exceptional cases in which a refusal of the right of residence and therefore of preservation of the family unit would contradict fundamental concepts of justice in the light of article 6 (1) and (2) of the Basic Law and article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights,and would therefore be simply indefensible. An extraordinary hardship in this sensefundamentally presupposes that the family member in need of protection is unable tosurvive independently, but must necessarily rely on the family’s assistance, and that suchassistance can reasonably be provided only in Germany.82However, if the unaccompanied minor has only been granted temporary protection status, granting a residence permit to the parents is discretionary.83 The law provides a non-exhaustive 75 SGB 8, § 42, para. 1, sentence 1, no. 3, § 42a. 76 Id. § 42a, para. 2, sentence 1, no. 2. 77 Id. § 42a, para. 5, sentence 2. 78 Id. § 42a, para. 5, sentence 3. 79 Dublin III Regulation, art. 8. 80 AufenthG, § 36, para. 1.

The Greek international protection legislation provides procedural protections to unaccompanied minors by adopting the best interest of the minor as a general principle in making decisions, and under certain circumstances exempting unaccompanied minors from disadvantageous fast-track procedures for the examination of asylum applications. The law establishes a centralized database of qualified legal entities that act as “guardianship service providers,” from which guardians are appointed to unaccompanied minors. The law designates the Special Secretariat for the Protection of Unaccompanied Minors under the Ministry of Migration and Asylum as the competent body responsible for administering the rules regarding the accommodation and care of unaccompanied minors, in cooperation with the minor’s appointed guardian and other immigration and social services authorities. While guardianship service providers remain the legal guardian of the unaccompanied minor, the law provides for various options for the physical custody and daily care of the minor, including placement with a foster family, accommodation in a full-service long-term accommodation center, or accommodation in semi-independent living facilities for older minors. General rules regarding repatriation are applicable to unaccompanied minors if and when their asylum applications are denied, or their status terminated. Unaccompanied minors have been resettled in other European countries through a voluntary resettlement program funded by the European Union.   I.  Introduction  The estimated number of migrants and asylum seekers who were unaccompanied minors (UAMs) and were first registered in Greece was around 2,220 in December 2021.1 Following the events that lead to the 2015 European refugee crisis, the European Union (EU) started allocating funds to Greece for the improvement of the country’s capacity to receive, accommodate, and process the influx of asylum seekers, with more than 3.3 billion euros being provided as of September 2021.2 Besides improving the country’s legal, administrative, and physical infrastructure for asylum management, a resettlement scheme was also created and funded by  1 See Maria Margarita Mentzelopoulou, Eur.

Nevertheless, its location as a neighbor of Turkey, which hosts the greatest number of asylum seekers globally, has put a strain on its legal, administrative, and physical capacity to receive and accommodate the arrival of asylum seekers in high numbers. Greece responded with a rapid evolution of its asylum laws in the period between 2015 and the present, an overview of which will be provided in this report to the extent it is applicable to UAMs.  A.  Legislative Framework  • The International Protection Code (IPC) provides the main legal framework establishing the rules and standards regarding the availability of asylum for third-country nationals or stateless persons in Greece.4 The provisions of the IPC concerning UAMs were recently reformed by Law 4960/2022.  • Law 4554/2018 on “guardianship of unaccompanied minors and other provisions” (LGUAM), which also amended Law 4960/2022, governs the process of the establishment of guardianship over UAMs and their placement with third parties, and creates the administrative framework for the appointment of guardians.5  • Ministerial Decision 9889/2020 issued by the Ministry of Migration and Asylum and the Ministry of Health governs the procedure for age determinations that are to be conducted in accordance with the IPC framework when there is doubt as to the age of an asylum seeker.6  B.  Jurisdictional Responsibilities  • The Asylum Service of the Ministry of Migration and Asylum is the main authority responsible for receiving applications for asylum and determining whether or not the third-country national or stateless person will be recognized as a beneficiary of international protection.  3 See Part V.A, infra. 4 Code of Legislation on the Reception, International Protection of Third Country Nationals and Stateless Persons and Temporary Protection in the Event of a Mass Influx of Displaced Foreigners (IPC), Law 4939/2022, E.K.E.D. 2022, A:111, https://perma.cc/K2R8-4J97 (in Greek), as amended by Law 4960/2022, E.K.E.D. 2022.

Defining Unaccompanied MinorsFor the purposes of Greek immigration and asylum law, an “unaccompanied minor” is defined as a minor who arrives in Greece without being accompanied by a person who exercises, in accordance with Greek law, his/her parental care or guardianship or by an adult relative who in practice exercises his/her care and for as long as the exercise of these duties has not been assigned to another person in accordance with the law. This definition also includes the minor who ceases to be accompanied after entering Greece.10 The law makes a distinction between an unaccompanied minor and a “minor separated from his/her family” (or “separated minor”). The latter is defined as a minor who arrives in Greece without being accompanied by a person exercising his/her parental care in accordance with Greek legislation or by another person to whom it has been assigned according to the law, but accompanied by an adult relative who in practice takes care of him/her.11 In this report, the term “UAM” will be used to include both categories of minors, unless otherwise indicated. III. Restrictions on Claiming AsylumArticle 89 of the IPC provides the grounds on which an application for international protection must be rejected as inadmissible. Rejection on the basis of inadmissibility precludes the application from being examined for its merits under articles 3-9 of the IPC, which provide the substantial requirements for a finding of a well-founded fear of prosecution. The existence of a “first country of asylum” in which the applicant has received international protection or in which 7 See Part III infra for an overview of the protections provided to UAMs under the law, including the role of the SSPUAM. 8 IPC arts. 66 ΙΑ; 64(2). 9 Id. art. 66Δ.10 IPC, art. 1(m). 11 Id. art. 1(n). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Greece The Law Library of Congress 79 asylum procedures must continue in accordance with EU law, or the existence of another country that would be considered safe for the applicant (“safe third country”) are considered bases for inadmissibility. The other two grounds of inadmissibility are the submission of a repeat application that does not show the existence of any new material elements, and the existence of a prior application that was made on the applicant’s behalf by a family member.12  A.  First Country of Asylum  The IPC provides that an application for international protection must be found inadmissible if the applicant was already granted international protection by an EU member state, or a third country that is considered a first country of asylum under the law. The application must be considered inadmissible also if another EU member state or state bound by EU law has assumed responsibility for examining the international protection application under Regulation (EU) 604/2013, which governs the allocation among EU member states and states bound by EU law of the responsibility for examining applicants for international protection.   The IPC defines a “first country of asylum” as follows:  A country shall be considered as the first country of asylum for the applicant on condition that he or she is readmitted to that country if he or she has been recognised as a refugee by it and still enjoys the relevant protection or enjoys other adequate protection in that country, including by benefiting from the principle of non-refoulement.13  While “first country of asylum” is provided as a discrete ground for inadmissibility, the Greek Council for Refugees (GCR) has reported on the basis of its communication with asylum authorities that it is not used as a stand-alone ground of inadmissibility in practice and that no applications were rejected solely on this ground in 2021.14   B.  Safe Third Country   The “safe third country” concept is an important restriction on the availability of international protection because  • it is a ground for inadmissibility and thus may lead to summary rejection of an application without an examination of specific merits of a claim to well-founded fear to return,  • the government may designate a country generally “safe” without needing to determine whether the country is specifically safe for the applicant (though the applicant has the right to object to the application of the determination to his specific case),15 and  12 IPC art. 89. 13 IPC art. 90. 14 Greek Council for Refugees (GCR), AIDA Asylum Information Database Country Report: Greece, 2021 Update  146-47 (2022), https://perma.cc/W8DJ-XRY3. 15 IPC art. 91(2), (3). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Greece The Law Library of Congress 80 • the law provides broad grounds for showing that the applicant has a personal connection to the safe third country, which must be shown for the concept to apply to the applicant.   The IPC provides the following detailed definition of “safe third country” and the applicant’s personal connections to the country that must be shown for the application to be found inadmissible on safe third country grounds:    Article 91 Safe third countries  1. A country shall be considered as a safe third country for a particular applicant, when the following criteria are cumulatively met:  a) his life and freedom are not threatened because of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political beliefs,  b) that country observes the principle of non-refoulement, in accordance with the Geneva Convention,  c) there is no risk of serious harm to the applicant according to article 14 of this Code,  d) that country prohibits the removal of someone to a country where he or she would be at risk of being subjected to torture or cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment, as defined in international law;  e) there is the possibility to request refugee status, and in the event that the applicant is recognized as a refugee, to be granted protection in accordance with the Geneva Convention and  f) the applicant has a link with the third country in question, on the basis of which it would be reasonable for him to go there. The applicant’s passage through a third country may, in combination with specific circumstances concerning him, in particular i) the time of his stay there, ii) possible contact or objective and subjective possibility of contact with the authorities, for access to work or the granting of a right of residence, iii) possible, prior to transit, residence, such as indicative long-term visits or studies, iv) existence of any even distant family ties, v) existence of social or professional or cultural relations, vi) existence of property, vii) connection with a wider community, viii) knowledge of the relevant language, ix) geographical proximity of the country of origin, to be considered as a link of the applicant with the third country,  2. The fulfillment of the above criteria is examined on a case-by-case basis and for each applicant separately, unless the third country has been characterized as generally safe and is included in the national list of safe third countries. . . .16  Article 91(2) of the IPC further provides that, if the safe third country is determined to be generally safe by a governmental decision, the applicant may object to the application of that determination to his or her specific case; however, the applicant has the burden to cite the reasons why the determination should not be applicable.  16 IPC art. 91(1)-(2). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Greece The Law Library of Congress 81 An important development was the Greek government’s decision in 2021 to consider Turkey a safe third country for asylum seekers originating from Syria, Afghanistan, Pakistan, Bangladesh, and Somalia, leading to a great increase of inadmissibility decisions being issued for such asylum seekers on the grounds of the safe third country concept.17  C. Exceptions for Unaccompanied MinorsUAMs are not excepted from the application of the grounds of inadmissibility to their applications. UAMs, however, do enjoy certain procedural protections in the form of being exempted in some circumstances from being processed under the three special fast-track examination procedures which are, primarily due to abbreviated timeframes, generally disadvantageous for applicants. The three special procedures are  •the “accelerated” procedure, which is applicable when the application or the applicantdemonstrates certain features that prima facie indicate the weakness or frivolity of theapplication,18•the “border” procedure, which is applicable where the application was lodged at the borderor in transit zones of ports of entry and the applicant is held in reception centers or closedfacilities while his application is examined on both its admissibility and its merits in anexpedited timeline not exceeding 28 days (the applicant is released if a decision cannot berendered in 28 days and the application transfers to the regular procedure) and the lawprovides that asylum seekers in the “border” procedure enjoy the same guarantees as thosewho have applied in the mainland and to which the regular procedure applies,19 and•the “fast-track border” procedure, whereby the registration and related paperwork, includingnotifications of decisions and receipt of appeals, may be conducted by the Hellenic Police orthe Armed Forces, and the asylum is conducted in practice by personnel deployed by theEuropean Union Agency for Asylum (but may be conducted, if needed, by the police ormembers of the armed forces with the necessary training).20 The “fast-track border” procedurealso has a severely expedited timeline, with the Asylum Service having to issue a first instancedecision in seven days, which must be appealed within 10 days; and the appeal must beexamined within four days of filing and a decision must be issued within seven days of theappeal hearing.21The “fast-track border” procedure appears to apply to asylum seekers arriving in the Greek Eastern Aegean Islands after the adoption of the EU-Turkey Statement of March 18, 2016, whereby Turkey agreed to accept rapid return of irregular migrants not in need of international protection (including those whose asylum application was denied) who have crossed from Turkey into Greece or in Turkish waters, in exchange for EU funds for refugee management in 17 GCR, supra note 14, at 137. 18 IPC art. 88(9). 19 Id. art. 95(1)-(2). 20 Id. art. 95(3)(b); GCR, supra note 14, at 94. 21 IPC art. 95(3)(c); GCR, supra note 14, at 94-95. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Greece The Law Library of Congress 82 Turkey and a 1-to-1 relocation scheme whereby the EU agreed to take one Syrian migrant for each Syrian migrant returned to Turkey.22 According to the GCR, the fast track border procedure  may result—and it often has—in compromising the procedural guarantees provided by the international, European and national legal framework, including the right to be assisted by a lawyer. As these extremely brief time limits undoubtedly affect the procedural guarantees available to asylum seekers subject to an accelerated procedure, as such, there should be an assessment of their conformity with Article 43 of the recast [EU] Asylum Procedures Directive, which does not permit restrictions on the procedural rights available in a border procedure for reasons related to large numbers of arrivals.23  UAMs under 15 years of age, or those UAMs who are victims of human trafficking, torture, rape or other serious forms of psychological, physical or sexual violence are exempted from all special procedures; their applications must be always examined under the regular procedure.24 UAMs who do not fall under this category are not categorically exempted from the three types of special procedures that exist in the IPC, and may have their applications examined under the special procedures mentioned above.  The IPC does not exempt UAMs from the application of these special procedures when they are applied on the grounds of the existence of a safe third country, while UAMs are exempted when the procedures are applied on the basis of various other grounds.25 Nevertheless, the IPC provides that the special procedures on this basis may be applied to a UAM only when they are in the best interest of the minor.26   IV.  Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Visas  A special visa regime exists for persons, including UAMs, who are considered to be victims of human trafficking or actions facilitating illegal immigration and who cooperate with competent authorities for the prosecution of such actions.27 The application of this regime is discretionary.28  22 GCR, supra note 14, at 93; Press Release, Eur.

Legal Representation  The system for the legal representation of UAMs was recently reformed by Law 4960/2022.  The SSPUAM is the competent authority responsible for ensuring that the UAM is put under guardianship and for supervising the implementation of the guardianship.29  Law 4960/2022 creates a National Guardianship System for Unaccompanied Minors (System) from which a registered guardian is appointed to the UAM, taking into account the best interests of the minor in light of the personal characteristics and circumstances of the minor and respecting his or her personal social, religious, and intercultural needs.30 Guardians are appointed by the public prosecutor, in principle from among guardianship service providers (GSPs) that are registered in the System.31 The IPC provides a list of legal persons that can be registered in the System as a GSP, which includes legal entities under public law, local government organizations, state legal persons governed by private law, civil nonprofit associations, public benefit foundations, civil nonprofit companies, civil society organizations, foreign nongovernmental organizations with branches in Greece, and international organizations.32 The IPC provides rules regarding the selection of GSPs by the Ministry of Migration and Asylum for inclusion in the System, the applicable tendering and contracting procedures, and the funding of the System.33 Guardian entities perform their duties of representation through guardianship officers, who must be qualified employees of the guardian entities.34 The Guardianship Board for Unaccompanied Minors established within the Ministry of Migration and Asylum has the power to review complaints concerning the guardianship services and decide on disagreements arising between a guardian and a UAM or between a guardian and the staff of the accommodation facility or other persons to whom the UAM was entrusted for daily care, such as foster parents, adult relatives, or close acquaintances.35  The appointed guardian holds the custody of the UAM, and is responsible for the UAM’s representation in matters of civil status and in assisting the UAM in matters relating to property.36   In fulfilling its duties as holder of custody, the guardian must seek and determine a place of safe and appropriate accommodation for the UAM in cooperation with the SSPUAM, ensure the UAM’s access to medical care and the obtaining of necessary health care and social security registration numbers for the UAM, take any action necessary for the enrollment of the UAM in education and training (including formal, nonformal, and vocational), and make the necessary  29 IPC art. 65(1), 65(2)(b). 30 Id. art. 66B. 31 Id. art. 66ΙΑ(1)-(2). 32 Id. art. 66H(1). 33 Id. arts. 66H(3)-(5); 66Θ. 34 Id. art. 66ΙΔ. 35 Id. art. 66S(4). 36 Id. art. 66Γ. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Greece The Law Library of Congress 84 arrangements for the daily care and supervision of the UAM, including arranging the placement of the UAM with a foster family or an adult relative for this purpose.37  The guardian has the power and duty to represent the UAM in any legal transaction where direct legal representation is allowed, in procedures related to international protection, immigration, and social integration, and in any other administrative and judicial procedure, including in the obtaining of a lawyer’s representation or free legal aid.38 The guardian also must assist the UAM in accessing social protection benefits, participating in economic life and employment and registration with the social security system and the tax system, and accessing banking services.39 The guardian must also, if authorized by the public prosecutor, take care and administer the property of the UAM, including bringing actions in the name of the minor if necessary.40 C. Role of Child Protection AgenciesAny competent authority that detects the entry into the territory of a UAM must immediately inform the SSPUAM, or the nearest public prosecutor’s office.41 Following the identification and registry of the UAM by the Reception and Identification Service or the police, the UAM must be placed by the SSPUAM in a special accommodation center that is appropriate for the age and circumstances of the UAM, or the SSPUAM and the public prosecutor may decide to immediately assign the UAM to an adult blood relative up to the third degree or to a person in the UAM’s friendly environment for day-to-day care, if this serves the best interest of the minor.42  The SSPUAM ensures that special accommodation centers and accompanying services are available for UAMs. The IPC provides for two main types of special accommodation centers, namely, long-term and emergency accommodation facilities. Long-term accommodation facilities consist of Accommodation Centers for Unaccompanied Minors (for ages 6-18), which are integrated care centers that offer a wide range of services such as accommodation, food, psychosocial support, healthcare, legal aid, educational activities and vocational training, interpretation, financial support under a funded program, clothing, and personal hygiene; and Supervised Semi-Independent Living Apartments where UAMs who are at least 16 years old and do not have circumstances that require close supervision may be placed and receive services such as accommodation, certain material benefits, financial assistance, psychosocial support, interpretation, assistance in access to education, vocational training and the labor market, legal aid, and access to healthcare.43 Long-term special accommodation facilities may be operated by 37 Id. art. 66Δ. 38 Id. art. 66E. 39 Id. art. 66ΣΤ. 40 Id. 41 Id. art. 64(1).  42 Id. art. 64(2). 43 Id. arts. 66ΚΣΤ; 66ΚΖ. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Greece The Law Library of Congress 85 the same types of noncommercial legal entities that can be registered in the System as a GSP.44 SSPUAM is responsible for the supervision of long-term accommodation facilities, and examining and deciding accommodation requests that are filed by GSPs for the placement of UAMs under their guardianship in appropriate accommodation facilities.45   SSPUAM is also responsible for identifying and immediately placing in emergency accommodation facilities UAMs who are homeless or are living in precarious circumstances.46  V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Administrative Detention During Application Process  Article 52 of the IPC provides that UAMs should be detained only in exceptional circumstances and never in correctional facilities. The detention, if necessary because alternative and less restrictive measures cannot be applied, must be kept as short as possible, and every effort should be made to refer the minor to accommodation centers that are suitable for minors. The minor must always be held separately from adults. The law limits the allowable detention period to 25 days, after which the UAM must be transferred to an accommodation center. All decisions regarding detention must be made considering the best interest of the minor. While in detention, minors must be provided with opportunities to engage in leisure activities, including games and educational and recreational activities appropriate to their age.47  B.  Removal Detention  The law provides for removal detention as a last resort. According to the generally applicable rules, an asylum seeker whose application is denied is generally given from seven to 30 days for his or her voluntary departure after the removal decision is finalized.48 This period may be extended to a maximum of one year, depending on the specific circumstances of the case.49 Removal detention and coerced removal apply only after the prescribed period for voluntary departure expires.50  The law nevertheless provides certain protections for UAMs. Accordingly, before a removal decision is rendered, the bodies responsible for the care of the UAM must be given an opportunity  44 Id. art. 66ΚΗ. For example, according to its 2022 report, METAdrasi operated 14 supervised semi-independent living apartments by 2021 that had hosted 173 beneficiaries since 2018.

Resettlement and Integration Programs  A.  Resettlement Programs  According to a press release issued by the European Commission, 1,274 UAMs who had arrived in Greece had been resettled in other European countries under the European Union’s “voluntary relocation scheme” by October 2022.53 Thirteen EU member-states and Switzerland, Norway, and Iceland participate in the relocation scheme that is managed by the EU Agency for Migration and the International Organization for Migration (IOM) in cooperation with the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, United Nations Children’s Fund, and the Greek government.54 EU funding is provided for the preparation for relocation, pre-relocation accommodation, and transfer costs through the EU Asylum Migration and Integration Fund.55 A reform of the intra-EU resettlement framework appears to be part of the negotiations on the EU’s proposal for a “New Pact on Migration and Asylum.”56   B.  Integration  Article 51 of the IPC mandates the integration of international protection applicants who are minors into the public education system for primary and secondary education no later than three months from the date of the completion of the identification of the minor by competent authorities.57 The law provides that nonformal education programs may be available in accommodation centers to facilitate integration, however these programs may not replace formal education in the public education system.58 It has been reported by METAdrasi that in certain  51 Id. art. 25(1). 52 Id. art. 25(2). 53 European Solidarity in Action: Over 5000 Relocations from Greece, Eur.

Family ReunificationGreek immigration law allows only legal residents, including refugee status holders, to apply for family reunification.64 There appears to be no advantageous special regime for family reunification that is available to UAMs, regardless of the status of their application for international protection.65 Nevertheless, the law requires authorities to consider possibilities for family reunification in the light of the best interest of the minor “when implementing” the IPC with regard to minors in general, and the IPC provides, as a general principle applicable to the processing of UAMs, that all authorities must, within their area of competence “swiftly seek a 59 METAdrasi, supra note 1, at 19. 60 Id. 61 Id. at 21.

Migrants may apply for asylum in Israel in accordance with a special procedure issued by the Ministry of Interior. Those qualifying for immigration under the Law of Return (olim) do not need to apply for asylum and are entitled to a variety of benefits including financial aid and participation in integration programs. Non-olim Ukrainian citizens are not required to file individual applications for asylum and are not subject to deportation procedures at this time.   The processing of asylum applications by unaccompanied minors requires handling with sensitivity to the minors’ specific circumstances. The state provides interpreters’ services during interviews. A number of NGOs and pro-bono lawyers provide applicants legal assistance and representation. There are procedures in place that facilitate the arrival of children based on the ground of family reunification. Israel has a well-established child protection system.   Israel has implemented repatriation programs for Africans who illegally crossed into Israel via Egypt through unrecognized border crossings. There do not appear to be repatriation programs currently available for Ukrainian refugees.   I.  Introduction  Israel is a signatory to the Convention of the Rights of the Child.1 It is also a signatory to the 1951 UN Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees,2 the Final Act of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Stateless Persons, 1954,3 and the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness.4 Israel has traditionally maintained restrictive immigration policies, however.5   1 Convention on the Rights of the Child, Nov. 20, 1989, 1577 U.N.T.S. 3, https://perma.cc/5BVH-XSCR. 2 Convention and Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees, July 28, 1951, 19 U.S.T. 6259, 189 U.N.T.S. 137 (Convention) & Jan. 31, 1967, 19 U.S.T. 6223, 606 U.N.T.S. 267 (Protocol), http://perma.cc/V86S-GU6S; Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees: Status of Signatories and Parties, United Nations Treaty Collection (U.N.T.C.), https://perma.cc/63FJ-VBR3; Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees: Status of Parties, U.N.T.C., https://perma.cc/C5HT-GKGM. 3 Final Act of the United Nations Conference on the Status of Stateless Persons, Sept. 28, 1954, 5158 U.N.T.S. 118–24, https://perma.cc/5STD-FDRM. 4 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness, Aug. 30, 1961, 989 U.N.T.S. 175, https://perma.cc/PS5N-BPMD. 5 Ruth Levush, Israel, Refugee Law and Policy in Selected Countries 165, Law Library of Congress (Mar. 2016), https://perma.cc/FHF5-R8RD. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Israel The Law Library of Congress 90 The processing of asylum requests is regulated under a procedure6 issued by Israel’s Ministry of Interior Population and Immigration Authority (PIA), based on authorities prescribed in the Entry into Israel Law, 5712-1952.7   Refugees who qualify for immigration under Law of Return, 5710-1950 (hereafter aliyah) are processed differently and are eligible for a variety of programs that are not extended to those who do not.8   In accordance with the Law of Return, every Jew, child and grandchild of a Jew, spouse of a Jew, and spouse of a child or a grandchild of a Jew, has a right to immigrate to Israel as an oleh. 9 The law authorizes the Minister of the Interior and the Minister of Foreign Affairs “to issue regulations regarding its implementation, as well as the granting of immigrant visas and residence certificates to minors up to the age of 18 subject to the approval of the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) Constitution, Law and Justice Committee.10   The Ministry of Aliyah and Integration (MAI) is responsible for implementation of government policies regarding immigration of olim (plural of oleh).11 The Ministry of the Interior is responsible for the implementation of laws and procedures regarding the entry and exit of non-olim.  II.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  In 2003, the PIA issued a special procedure for handling the entry and exit of unaccompanied minors at recognized border crossings (Procedure 6.4.0003). The procedure was updated periodically with the latest update adopted in 2015.12 The procedure applies to the “handling of the entry and exit of at Israel's air, land and sea border crossings of minors who are not accompanied by one of their parents or a guardian, and not as part of a delegation from a public authority in Israel.”13 The procedure regulates documentation and verification of documents proving the consent of the minor’s parents to the entry and exit of their unaccompanied minor.14   The handling of asylum requests is regulated under Procedure 5.2.0012. This procedure provides that “[t]he processing of an asylum application submitted by an unaccompanied minor, a person  6 Procedure for Dealing with Political Asylum Seekers in Israel (Procedure 5.2.0012), § 1(B) (updated Mar. 21, 2022), Ministry of Interior Population and Immigration Authority (PIA), https://perma.cc/4LUV-SW9F. 7 Entry into Israel Law, 5712-1952, SH 5712 No. 111 p. 354, as amended, Nevo Legal Database (Nevo), https://perma.cc/Q3LV-QM44 (in Hebrew, by subscription). 8 Law of Return, 5710-1950, No. 51 p. 159, as amended, Nevo, https://perma.cc/P5SG-ZAEJ (in Hebrew, by subscription). 9 Id. §§ 1, 4 & 4A. 10 Id. § 5. 11 Homepage, Ministry of Aliyah and Integration, https://perma.cc/2SHQ-LVZ6. 12 Experimental Procedure for Handling the Entry and Exit of Unaccompanied Minors at Border Crossings (Procedure 6.4.0003) (updated May 12, 2015), PIA, https://perma.cc/AW4M-27H5 (in Hebrew). 13 Id. § B. 14 Id. § D(8), form B & § E(f1). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Israel The Law Library of Congress 91 suffering from mental disorders or a torture victim will be done with special attention and sensitivity to their specific circumstances.”15   In the absence of a separate definition for unaccompanied minors under Procedure 5.2.0012, it is likely that the definition provided under Procedure 6.4.0003 would apply to the handling of asylum requests.  III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  A. African “Infiltrators”  Entry into Israel that does not occur through legally designated border crossings constitutes a criminal offense under the Prevention of Infiltration (Offenses and Jurisdiction) Law, 5714-1954, as amended. Those who cross into Israel without passing through designated borders (infiltrators) may be sentenced for five years imprisonment, a fine, or both. Infiltrators, however, may file asylum requests.16   According to a 2011 Knesset report, there were reportedly about 200 unaccompanied minors from third countries who entered Israel via undesignated border crossings from Egypt in 2010. 17 By July 2020, there were reportedly 37,288 persons who infiltrated into Israel from Egypt, 71% of whom were citizens of Eritrea (26,563), 21% citizens of Sudan (7,624), 7% citizens of other countries in Africa, and 1% citizens of the rest of the world.18   The number of infiltrators has drastically declined in recent years following the completion of the construction of a barrier between Egypt and Israel, which has almost completely prevented crossing from Egypt into Israel. Consequently, there has been a significant decline in the growth rate of some of the children’s populations.19 A similar barrier along the border with Jordan was reportedly built in 2016-17.20 By 2020, 613 infiltrators had left Israel.21  Israel has implemented a number of repatriation programs with regard to infiltrators. According to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), since 2009, Israel has resettled over 1,000 refugees, mostly to Australia, Canada, Denmark, Finland, France, the Netherlands,  15 Procedure 5.2.0012, supra note 6, § 1(B). 16 Prevention of Infiltration (Offenses and Jurisdiction) Law, 5714-1954, as amended, Nevo, https://perma.cc/Z3QF-2DY7 (in Hebrew, by subscription); see also, Ruth Levush, Israel, Refugee Law and Policy in Selected Countries, supra note 5. 17 Designated Travel Documents for Minors (Minor Visa)- Comparative Survey, KIRC (June 27, 2011), https://perma.cc/FER6-2PYE (in Hebrew). 18 Statistics on Foreigners in Israel, PIA (July 2020), https://perma.cc/82ZX-WFDQ (in Hebrew). 19 Alternatives to Imprisonment of Children of Immigrants in Israel, Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, https://perma.cc/7944-KUDR (in Hebrew). 20 Amir Buchbut, Watch: This is What the Fence Being Built on the Israel-Jordan Border Looks Like from a Bird's Eye View, Walla (July 28, 2016), https://perma.cc/H873-WXAH (in Hebrew). 21 Statistics on Foreigners in Israel, supra note 18. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Israel The Law Library of Congress 92 New Zealand, Norway, Spain, Switzerland, Sweden, and the United States. In 2019, there were 289 spots available for refugees to be resettled out of Israel.22  The repatriation of infiltrators to third countries is regulated under Procedure No. 10. 9.0005, issued on January 30, 2018.23 According to the procedure, the State of Israel has reached arrangements with two different African countries that enables Israel to offer infiltrators the opportunity to safely relocate to a third country and unsure that they would not be repatriated to their countries of origin.24 Israel further offered infiltrators who consented to be relocated within a specified three months period an amount of $3500 each.25  According to Procedure 10. 9.0005, the population slated for repatriation to third countries was that of infiltrators from Eritrea and Sudan who have not applied for asylum, those whose application for asylum has been denied, and those who applied for asylum after January 1, 2018.26 Third country repatriation procedures do not apply to women, minors, custodian parents of a minor child, and persons suspected of being victims of human trafficking.27  According to the UNHCR, [v]ery few Eritreans and Sudanese asylum-seekers in Israel have been granted refugeestatus. The authorities instead provide these individuals with temporary group protectionwith limited rights and entitlements, including protection from refoulement and informalaccess to the labour market. This form of protection does not lead to a long-term solutionfor them.Since the early 2000s, the temporary group protection scheme has also been used for nationals of the Democratic Republic of Congo, Sierra Leone, Liberia, Côte d’Ivoire, and South Sudan. Following political changes in some of these countries, most notably Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Côte d’Ivoire, most of the asylum-seekers (some 2,000) have repatriated. These nationals were given six months to one-year to prepare for their return. Some saved money to help them upon their return home or learned a new skill to ease their reintegration into their county’s recovering labour market. In the case of South Sudan, a newborn state that declared independence in July 2011, refugees were asked to return prematurely on short notice. An estimated 1,500 persons were returned to South Sudan. Few vulnerable families and people with special medical 22 Resettlement, UNHCR Israel, https://perma.cc/DMZ5-9LQB. 23 Removal for Third Countries (Procedure 10. 9.0005) (Jan. 30, 2018), PIA, https://perma.cc/ZV64-ZA7G (in Hebrew). 24 Id. § 2.3. 25 Id. § 2.4. 26 Id. § 3. 27 Id. § 3.2. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Israel The Law Library of Congress 93 and mental needs were allowed to stay in Israel, in the absence of proper facilities and services to cater to their special needs.28 According to a comprehensive comparative study issued by Israel’s PIA in October 2022, infiltrators from Darfur and the Nuba Mountains are not persecuted on the basis of their ethnic origin in Sudan, and as a rule, they can return to live safely in the capital city of Khartoum . . . . The completion of the study is an important step in advancing the ability to decide on individual asylum applications of immigrants from Darfur and the Nuba Mountains in Israel, and it can be assumed that in the absence of individual grounds, many asylum applications will be denied. The comprehensive study was recently transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for its assistance, following the receipt of an opinion from the National Security Council containing information that also supports the conclusions drawn from the study.29 B. Refugees from Ukraine, Russia and BelarusIn 2022, the Ministry of Interior authorized the entry of a limited number of persons ineligible for aliya from Ukraine and Russia. The number of those admitted, including unaccompanied minors, however, has not been identified.30 UNHCR has no resettlement quotas or places for Ukrainian refugees. 31  On February 27, 2022, the PIA announced that Ukrainian citizens staying in Israel would not be required to file individual applications for asylum and that they would not be subject to deportation procedures “until the situation in their home country clears up.”32  According to data received from PIA, from the outbreak of the war between Russia and Ukraine, until January 4, 2023, 57,223 aliya-eligible immigrants arrived in Israel:  41,813 from Russia, 13,420 from Ukraine, and 1,990 from Belarus. Initially, 61% of those arriving from Ukraine were women due to the restrictions imposed on the exit of men from Ukraine, but later on the gap has narrowed. Between October and November of 2022, a total of more than 10,000 immigrants 28 Voluntary Repatriation, UNHCR Israel, https://perma.cc/SET7-JLU5. 29 PIA Press Release, Minister Shaked toughens the policy towards Sudanese from Darfur and the Nubia Mountains, stating that they, too, are not in danger in Sudan (Oct. 18, 2022), https://perma.cc/59EW-EER9 (in Hebrew). 30 Ilia Eliyhu, Knesset Center of Information and Research (KIRC), Data on Aliyah to Israel from Ukraine and Russia During 2022 (Dec. 12, 2022), https://perma.cc/6YG9-CE4T (in Hebrew). 31 Information for Ukrainians in Israel, UNHCR Israel, https://perma.cc/T37D-NXMX. 32 PIA Press Release, The Population & Immigration Authority is honored to announce . . . that following the warfare in Ukraine . . . no enforcement and deportation activities will be conducted (Feb. 27, 2022), https://perma.cc/4ZA6-6SW4. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Israel The Law Library of Congress 94 arrived from Russia in parallel with the announcement of the military drafting of men in Russia at the end of September.33   In total, 138,231 non-aliyah eligible citizens of Ukraine, Russia and Belarus have reportedly entered Israel during the Russia-Ukraine war. They received a B/2 visa, which is a three-month tourist visa. Non-olim include 90, 221 from Russia (221,90), 41, 425 from Ukraine, and 6,585 from Belarus. As of January 4, 2023, 77% of the total number (106, 091 of them) were no longer in Israel.34  IV.  Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Processing Asylum Requests  Procedure 5.2.0012 requires interviews of asylum seekers to be conducted with sensitivity to gender considerations, with particular sensitivity to victims of gender-based violence, including sexual violence. For this purpose, employees of the Ministry’s unit dealing with asylum requests are required to undergo training that  will include contents that deal with gender sensitivity, such as: the psychological effects of trauma (unwillingness to provide full information, difficulties in giving a statement, memory disorders); cultural perceptions towards women in the country of origin and their effect on the asylum seeker).35  Interviews are done in the language of the asylum seeker or with the assistance of a translator. The asylum seeker may be represented by an attorney.36  According to the UNHCR,  [a]side from unaccompanied minors and victims of trafficking, asylum seekers do not enjoy access to State legal aid in their asylum adjudication or other non-criminal proceedings. To facilitate the legal process for asylum seekers, UNHCR cooperates with a number of NGOs and pro-bono lawyers providing legal assistance and representation. Interpreters are provided by the State during all interviews, although a recent amendment to the Procedure allows asylum seekers to bring their own interpreters if the State is unable to provide one in the relevant language.37    B.  Role of Child Protection Agencies  A UNHCR report states that Israel has a well-established child protection system. In August 2020, there were “approximately 8,500 children of asylum-seekers, the majority born in Israel.

Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  A. Detention of Migrants Arriving Through Recognized Legal Border Crossings  The Entry into Israel Law authorizes the detention of persons entering Israel without a valid visa for up to 60 days  with detention reviewed by the ‘Immigration Detention Review Tribunal’ within 96 hours and thereafter every 30 days. Detention beyond the 60-day period is permitted under this law if release would harm public health or the order or security of the State, or if the detainee fails to cooperate with his deportation from the country.39  Foreign nationals who are either refused entry into the country or who were unlawfully residing in the country may be detained prior to deportation at the Yahalom airport detention facility, which is run by the Ministry of Interior. According to the non-profit organization Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, in 2020, no families with children were held in Yahalon for long periods of time.40  A newspaper article, which was published in January 2023, claims that the facility processed 40,414 people between 2017 and 2022, the majority of whom stayed at Yahalom less than a week. During that period, 1,142 minors were detained there. The article claims that PIA had produced an internal audit report on its Yahalom detention facility but had refused to publish it because of concerns that doing so might “violate privacy and undermine proper functioning and [their] ability to do [their] jobs.”41  According to the article,  [o]ne of the criticisms presented in the report is the sparsity of toys and other equipment needed for a family making an extended stay in the facility. Authority officials note that they are pushing for purchases of toys for children being held in the facility. Likewise, the comptroller proposed that the authority consider allowing minors staying in the facility to use a cellphone. According to authority guidelines, every minor entering the facility must meet with a social worker within 24 hours of arrival, and that families may only be held up to 72 hours.42   38 UNHCR, Israel Factsheet 4 (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/7A6R-M732. 39 Detention of Asylum Seekers in Israel, UNHCR Israel, https://perma.cc/CZ28-YPEH; Entry into Israel Law, 5712-1952, § 13, SH 5712 No. 111 p. 354, supra note 7. 40 Hotline for Refugees and Migrants, Detention of Migrants and Asylum Seekers in Israel, Annual Monitoring Report 2020 13 (June 2021), https://perma.cc/G7FH-5V63. 41 Bar Peleg, Israel Refuses to Release Full Report on Negligence at Airport Detention Facility, Haaretz (Jan. 9, 2023), https://perma.cc/N7NU-3SEL. 42 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Israel The Law Library of Congress 96 B. Detention of Infiltrators  The Prevention of Infiltration (Offenses and Jurisdiction) Law, 5714-1954, as amended, authorizes the Minister of Defense to order the deportation from Israel of infiltrators.43 The law was designed to apply to illegal crossing into Israel from neighboring countries that had been in a state of war with Israel.   Following the influx in illegal crossings via Egypt by thousands of migrants from Africa, certain provisions of the law were amended with regard to detention procedures of infiltrators. As noted, since the construction of the Egypt-Israel border fence in June 2012, there has been a marked decrease in new arrivals, “from over 12,000 in mid-2012 to only 22 in 2014; 220 in 2015; 18 in 2016, and 0 since May 2016.”44 The temporary provisions regarding detention under this law have meanwhile expired.45  VI.  Resettlement and Integration Programs  A. Aliyah Eligible Immigrants  Israel has operated a number of programs to facilitate the entry and residence of unaccompanied minors who qualify as olim under the Law of Return for purpose of attending high school and developing their Jewish identity. In addition, private entities, such as the Young Members of the Chabad Association, have brought to Israel unaccompanied minors from Chernobyl and other places with government approval.46   According to information posted on the MAI website, olim may receive an absorption basket based on eligibility criteria, as follows:  [t]he Absorption Basket is financial assistance for new immigrants during the initial period in Israel, as they settle into their new lives. Assistance is provided to cover living expenses for the duration of ulpan [Hebrew classes] study (6 months). The financial assistance also includes rental assistance for the first 12 months in Israel. The absorption basket is provided to new immigrants from the world over. 47  The ministry’s website contains “absorption basket payment tables” arranged by marital and pre and post retirement age status.48 In addition to financial aid, the MAI maintains a variety of  43 Prevention of Infiltration (Offenses and Jurisdiction) Law, 5714-1954, supra note 16, § 30(a). 44 Detention of Asylum Seekers in Israel, UNHCR Israel, https://perma.cc/CZ28-YPEH. 45 The text of the Prevention of Infiltration (Offenses and Jurisdiction) Law, 5714-1954, effective under temporary amendment passed in 2014, containing provisions on detention, now expired, https://perma.cc/6TA7-UGDA. 46 State Comptroller Report, Bringing Children to Israel Not by Their Parents (2014), https://perma.cc/86Z2-UL2C (in Hebrew). 47 Absorption Basket – \"Sal Klita\" (updated to Feb. 2, 2023), MAI, https://perma.cc/T6Y2-LCVK. 48 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Israel The Law Library of Congress 97 programs designed to assist olim in regard to employment, business and entrepreneurship, integration of scientists, learning Hebrew, and other educational programs. 49  B. Immigrants who are Not Eligible for Aliyah  Persons not eligible for aliyah are subject to different procedures than olim with regard to conditions of stay in Israel (e.g., the possibility of working) and government assistance.   Various ministries and other bodies are engaged in providing assistance to non-olim citizens of Ukraine. These include the ministries of welfare, education, health, interior, MIA, and local authorities. According to a Knesset report, about 75% of non-olim Ukrainian citizens live in Israel with a host family, due to the difficulty of renting an apartment on their own, however. 50  VII.  Family Reunification  A child born in Israel to a parent who has authorization for permanent or temporary residence may be eligible for the same status as the parent under conditions enumerated in procedures issued by the population and immigration agency of the ministry of interior.51   In accordance with Procedure 5.2.0012, a person who has been recognized as a refugee by the Minister of Interior and who has received a A/5 temporary residence visa will be allowed to submit an application for a residency license for his or her spouse and minor children. The application will be examined by an advisory committee that will provide its assessment to the PIA’s Director General for a decision on eligibility.52      49 New Immigrants, MAI, https://perma.cc/8WVX-F5SR. 50 Ilia Eliyahu, Data on Aliyah to Israel from Ukraine and Russia in 2022, supra note 30. 51 Procedure for Handling the Filing of Applications for a Minor under Regulation 12 of the Entry into Israel Regulations, 5734-1974 (Procedure 5.2.0029) (Aug. 1, 2017), Hamoked, https://perma.cc/7QNQ-XJEN (in Hebrew); Procedure 5.2.0029 (updated May 7, 2019), https://perma.cc/L7NW-E5R2 (in Hebrew). 52 Procedure 5.2.0012, supra note 6, § 12(A). \fThe Law Library of Congress 98 Italy Dante Figueroa Senior Legal Information Analyst   SUMMARY As of December 2022, the number of unaccompanied foreign minors (Minori Stranieri Non Accompagnati, MSNA) registered in Italy was around twenty thousand. Italy is a party to the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989. Recent legislation on MSNA from 2017 overhauled the legal regime applying to MSNA. The core rule is that MSNA may never be rejected at the border, and refoulement and expulsion are prohibited. Once a MSNA is found in the Italian territory, they must be provided with a full array of health and social services and assistance aimed at their identification, determination of age, and wellbeing. The paramount rule is that all decisions must be made based on the best interest of the child. Once MSNA have been provided with basic services, the legislation grants them a roster of legal and social benefits first and foremost, and a residence permit allows them to pursue educational and social integration opportunities. Repatriation of MSNA is allowed under strict criteria and conditions, and family reunification is broadly permitted pursuant to European Union and domestic Italian legislation.     I.  Introduction  A. Statistics   The most recent report on statistics related to unaccompanied foreign minors in Italy was prepared by the Ministry of Labor and Social Policies, considering information available through December 31, 2022.1 The following are some highlights of this report:  • Unaccompanied foreign minors (Minori Stranieri Non Accompagnati, MSNA) registered in Italy through December 31, 2022, numbered 20,089, which shows a sharp increase since 2021 (+64%) and is mainly due to the humanitarian crisis taking place in Ukraine since February of 2022;2  • MSNA from Ukraine amount to 5,042 (25.1%), from Egypt, 4,899 (24.4%), Tunisia: 1,800, Albania: 1,347, and Pakistan: 1,082;3   • Of the total MSNA, 85.1% are males and 14.9% are females;  • Most MSNA are 17 years of age (44.4%), while those 16 years of age are 24% of the total and those between 7 and 14 years of age amount to 17.5%; and  1 Direzione Generale dell’Immigrazione e delle Politiche di Integrazione – Divisione II, Unaccompanied Foreign Minors in Italy, Semiannual Report Data as of December 31, 2022, https://perma.cc/B3WW-H73V. 2 Unaccompanied Foreign Minors: Rules and Data on the Presence, Protection and Reception of Unaccompanied Minors, Direzione Generale dell’Immigrazione e delle Politiche di Integrazione, https://perma.cc/3VYK-WG95. 3 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Italy The Law Library of Congress 99 • The Italian regions that receive MSNA in larger numbers are: Sicily (3,923, that is, 19.5% of the total), Lombardy (2,880, 14.3%), Calabria (2,068, 10.3%) and Emilia-Romagna (1,814, 9%).4  Further statistical information on the presence of MSNA in Italy can be found on the website of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policies.5   B. Jurisdictional Responsibilities  Per Regulation No. 535 of 1999, the General Directorate of Immigration and Integration Policies, part of the Ministry of  Labor and Social Policies, is the government agency in charge of recording MSNA information in the database created for that purpose.6 The Directorate prepares and publishes in-depth reports twice a year on the presence of MSNA in Italy, monitoring the presence, characteristics, and welcoming of MSNA, while also accounting for new arrivals and removals, requests for international protection, family surveys in the countries of origin, and opinions on the conversion of residence permits upon MSNA reaching the age of majority.7 The reports must also illustrate the Italian and international procedural and regulatory innovations and measures for the social and employment integration of MSNA.8  The Committee for Foreign Minors, under the Presidency of the Council of Ministers, has jurisdiction to oversee compliance with the legal requirements established to grant residence to MSNA temporarily admitted into the national territory.9  Juvenile courts (tribunale per i minorenni) have jurisdiction to order, in exceptional cases, the expulsion of a MSNA.10    4 Id. 5 Rapporti di Approfondimento sulla Presenza dei MSNA in Italia (2023), Ministero del Lavoro e delle Politiche Sociali, https://perma.cc/TL5Y-LKRD.

International Framework  Legislative Decree No. 286 of 1998 provides that in all administrative and judicial procedures that have been established to implement the right to family unity and concerning minors, priority must be given to the best interests of the child,20 as provided in the Convention on the Rights of the Child of 1989.21 This Convention was ratified by Italy by Law No. 176 of 1991, which further stated that priority consideration of the best interests of the child must be given in all administrative and judicial procedures concerning family reunification and separation matters.22  Current legislation declares the intention of the Italian Republic to join international cooperation efforts underway in order to protect MSNA who might enter the national territory.23  II.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  For legal purposes, a MSNA is defined as “a minor who is not an Italian or European Union citizen, who for whatever reason is found in Italian territory or is subject to Italian jurisdiction, and who lacks the assistance or representation of his parents or other adults who would be responsible for him according to Italian legislation.”24  III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  A. Limits on Consideration of Asylum Applications from Minors who Transited Through Third Countries  Border police are authorized to reject foreigners at border crossing points when such foreigners, irrespective of their age, lack the requisites established in the law for entry into the national territory.25 This authorization also applies to foreigners who were previously admitted temporarily to the territory based on their need for public assistance.26 Minors also fall into the category of foreigners who can be apprehended in the interior after having entered the national territory avoiding border controls, and must be accompanied to the border.27    20 D.L.

Safe Third Country Agreements  No information was found on this topic.  C. Exceptions for Unaccompanied Minors  In exceptional cases when the expulsion of a foreign minor is ordered by the juvenile court, such a measure may be adopted only if it does not cause a risk of serious damage to the minor.28  IV.  Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A. Humanitarian and Other Assistance  The law mandates the provision of immediately necessary humanitarian assistance, including first aid and specially-dedicated hospitality facilities, to MSNA found in the national territory.29 In effect, MSNA found in the Italian territory have a right to obtain healthcare and education opportunities, even before they receive a residence permit.30 The intervention of cultural mediators is required in all decisions concerning the minors’ health and education needs.31 B. Judicial and Administrative Assistance The law establishes a Committee for Foreign Minors under the Presidency of the Council of Ministers to oversee compliance with the legal requirements established to grant residence to MSNA temporarily admitted into the national territory.32 MSNA also have the right to be heard in all judicial and administrative proceedings affecting them.33 Their consent is necessary for the intervention of non-governmental organizations dedicated to the assistance of vulnerable persons in legal procedures concerning them.34 The minors have the right to appoint legal counsel of their confidence to handle judicial and administrative procedures involving them; starting in 2017, funds for the payment of legal fees incurred by MSNA are provided for under the Law.35   28 Law No. 47, arts. 3(1)(a) & 3(1)(b). 29 D.L.

Identification of the Minor   The procedure for the identification of an MSNA operates as follows: when an MSNA first comes into contact with an Italian government official or has been reported to the police authorities, social services employees, other representatives of the respective local authority, or delegates of the judicial authority, an inquiry must begin to determine the personal and family history of the MSNA in order to adopt the best protective measures.36  A “cultural mediator” must be present in the interviews with the minor.37  A “cultural mediator” is a person with a professional degree granted by an Italian institution of higher education, whose services are used in different contexts, including by juvenile courts, to assist in the proceedings involving foreign persons.38  Public security authorities, aided by cultural mediators and in the presence of the permanent or temporary guardian assigned to the minor, interview the minor to determine his or her identity, but, as already stated, only after any immediately necessary humanitarian assistance is provided to the minor.39 The MSNA must receive information —with the help of the cultural mediator, in a language that he or she can understand and in accordance with his or her degree of maturity and literacy—of the fact that his or her age can be determined with the aid of socio-health examinations, also about the type of examinations which he or she must undergo, the possible expected results and their possible consequences, including the consequences deriving from his or her possible refusal to undergo such examinations.40 This information must also be provided to the person who, even temporarily, exercises guardianship powers over the presumed minor.41 Social and health examinations that could compromise the psycho-physical state of the person are prohibited.42  The result of the socio-medical assessment is communicated to the minor, in a manner congruent with his or her age, maturity, and level of literacy, to the person in charge of parental responsibility and to the judicial authority that ordered the assessment.43 The margin of error must always be indicated in the final report.44  Local government agencies must provide first aid and hospitality facilities especially dedicated to MSNA.45   36 Id. art. 5(1), adding article 19-bis(1) to D.L.

Determination of the Age of MSNA  In cases of well-founded doubts relating to the age declared by the minor, such age must be ascertained through documents and also with the assistance of the respective diplomatic and consular authorities.46 The age of the minor must be established only if there is no risk that the establishment of age could result in persecution of the minor.47 If there are still well-founded doubts regarding the age declared by an unaccompanied foreign minor, at the request of the Attorney General of the Republic, the local juvenile court establishes the age of the minor.48  E. Human Trafficking   Per the Law, particular attention must be borne by the respective authorities so that MSNA do not fall victim to human trafficking.49 The MSNA also has a right to receive adequate assistance from the authorities when the minor has been the victim of human trafficking.50   F. Visas  The police chief (questore) issues a residence permit for minors in the following cases:  • To MSNA traced in the national territory and reported to the competent authorities, at the request of the minor, directly or through the person exercising parental authority over them. The permit is valid until the age of majority;51 and  • Based on family reasons, to minors younger than 14 years of age who are entrusted to public or private assistance institutions according to Law No. 184 of 1982,52 or are subjected to the guardianship of an Italian citizen with the same cohabitant, or minors aged 14 years of age or older who are subject to the protection of a foreigner legally residing in the national territory or of an Italian citizen with the same cohabitant.53  Based on their particular situation of vulnerability, the law protects MSNA who enter Italy without an adult by recognizing the same rights for the MSNA as those given to Italian and European Union minors.54  Outside of the aforementioned situations, unaccompanied foreign minors are subject to the general legislation on immigration and the status of foreigners in Italy.  46 Id. art. 5(3). 47 Id. art. 5(2). 48 Id. art. 5(4). 49 Id. art. 17(1). 50 Id. art. 17(2). 51 Id. art. 10(1)(a). 52 Legge 4 maggio 1983, n. 184 (Law No. 184), art. 9, para. 4, https://perma.cc/P2BP-QF7Y. 53 Law No. 47, art. 10(1)(b). 54 Id. art. 1(1). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Italy The Law Library of Congress 105 G. Legal Representation  The law recognizes the right of MSNA to be heard in all judicial and administrative proceedings affecting them,55 to appoint their own legal counsel, and to receive funds for the payment of their legal fees.56   H. Role of Child Protection Agencies  The Law creates the National Information System for Foreign Unaccompanied Minors, dependent of the Ministry of Labor and Social Policies.57 The System maintains a special archive with information for each unaccompanied foreign minor.58 Such registration is aimed at protecting the best interest of the minor.59   V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  A. Procedures (Special Courts or Tribunals, Appeals, Judicial Review)  The amendments introduced by Law No. 47 specify that foreign unaccompanied minors may never be rejected at the border, and refoulement and expulsion are prohibited.60    B. Alternatives to Detention  1. Placing with Foster Families  Several government agencies join in conducting an investigation to establish whether the minor has appropriate family members who may assume the care of the minor; only if there is no willing and able family member is the minor placed with a foster family.61 Local government entities may promote the designation of foster families to whom juvenile courts may entrust the care of foreign unaccompanied minors.62   2. Appointment of Tutors  Law No. 47 ordered the creation within 90 days from its entry into force of a roster of volunteer tutors at all juvenile courts throughout the country, composed by citizens selected and vetted by  55 Id. art. 15(1). 56 Id. art. 16(1). 57 Id. art. 9(1). 58 Id. art. 9(1)—(2). 59 Id. art. 9(3). 60 Id. art. 3(1)(a) & b). 61 Id. art. 6(2), adding art. 19(7-quater) to D.L.

Continued Assistance Beyond the Age of Maturity  In the case of MSNA who reach the age of majority and, despite having followed a path of social integration, still need support to achieve autonomy (for example, when the minor is pursuing formal educational opportunities), the respective juvenile court may order, at his or her request or that of the social welfare authorities, his or her placement under the care of the respective social services agency. This right to be placed with a social service agency expires upon the MSNA reaching the age of 21.64  C. Conditions of Detention  Facilities for the welcoming of MSNA must satisfy the minimum standards for services and assistance provided by residential facilities for minors and be authorized or accredited in accordance with national and regional legislation.65  D. Educational and Humanitarian Programs Offered in Detention  Besides what has been stated above on this report, no further information on this topic was found.  E. Repatriation (Financial Assistance, Conditions)  General immigration legislation provides that based on reasons of public order or state security, the Minister of the Interior may order the expulsion of a foreigner, even if not resident in the state, with prior notice to the President of the Council of Ministers and the Minister of Foreign Affairs.66 The respective questore may also order an administrative expulsion when the foreigner entered the national territory avoiding border controls and was not rejected, as mandated by the law.67 Similarly, the questore may order the expulsion of a foreigner who has been detained in the national territory without having previously requested a residence permit within the prescribed term (except in the case of force majeure), when the persons’ residence permit has been revoked or annulled, or when the permit expired more than 60 days prior and no renewal has been requested.68    63 Id. art. 11(1). 64 Id. art. 13(2). 65 Id. art. 12(1)(b), adding article 19(2-bis) to D.L.

Procedure  Implementing Regulation (UE) No. 118/2014 establishes the presence of a family member, relative of relation of the MSNA as a means of proof within the process of determining the State responsible for examining an application for international protection.77  Foreigners may request reunification for dependent minor children.78 For purposes of reunification, minor children are those younger than 18 years of age. Adopted or foster minors or minors subject to custody are included in the definition of children.79    Regardless of whether they are unmarried or legally separated, foreigners who are present in the national territory may request reunification with their family members, including dependent minor children and those of the spouse or born out of wedlock, on condition that the other parent has given his or her consent.80   75 Council Directive 2003/86/EC of 22 September 2003 on the Right to Family Reunification, art. 10(3), https://perma.cc/PB7F-YWHR. 76 Regulation (EU) No 604/2013 of the European Parliament and of the Council of June 26, 2013, Establishing the Criteria and Mechanisms for Determining the Member State Responsible for Examining an Application for International Protection Lodged in One of the Member States by a Third-Country National or a Stateless Person (Recast), article 6(4), https://perma.cc/37QV-863P. 77 Commission Implementing Regulation (EU) No 118/2014 of 30 January 2014 Amending Regulation (EC) No 1560/2003 laying down detailed Rules for the Application of Council Regulation (EC) No 343/2003 Establishing the Criteria and Mechanisms for Determining the Member State Responsible for Examining an Application for International Protection Lodged in One of the Member States by a Third-Country National, Annex II(I)(1), https://perma.cc/88MJ-FQ4F. 78 D.L.

It is not considered a desirable state by asylum seekers, but many have found themselves on its shores after encountering difficulties in the seas while trying to get to mainland Europe. Malta struggled with an influx of asylum seekers at the turn of this century, but numbers have drastically dropped in recent years. Malta is a signatory of the Refugee Convention and, as a Member State of the European Union (EU), it has transposed into its national laws a number of EU directives providing common standards that define who qualifies for international protection and set the procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection.   The International Protection Agency is responsible for all parts of the process for international protection, and the Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers is responsible for implementing laws and policy.    The laws of Malta provide special protections for unaccompanied minors seeking international protection. These individuals are provided with legal assistance and representatives to help them navigate the asylum procedure. Maltese law prohibits the use of detention for minors under the age of 16. Individuals claiming to be under the age of 18, or in cases where the age of an applicant is uncertain, undergo an age assessment to determine their age. During the time they are waiting for the assessment, these individuals are typically detained, and the conditions of their detention have been the subject of much criticism.   Once unaccompanied minors receive refugee status, they are eligible for family reunification with their first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line, or their guardian if these individuals cannot be located or are no longer alive, if it is in their best interests for this to occur. If it is, the family is traced, using the assistance of international organizations, and once documentation and examinations determine an individual is a member of the family member, a visa is issued to enable the individual to enter Malta.   I.  Introduction  The state of Malta consists of six small islands totaling 316 square kilometers located in the Mediterranean Sea between Sicily and Libya. It is one of the most densely populated countries in the world.1 Malta achieved independence from Britain in 1964 and adopted a constitution that  1 Home Aff., Strategy for the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Irregular Migrants 3, https://perma.cc/H8PE-YVXB.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Malta The Law Library of Congress 111 same year.2 It became a member of the European Union (EU) on May 1, 2004,3 and adopted the Euro as its currency on January 1, 2008.4   Malta has traditionally been a country of emigration.5 It is not considered a desirable state by asylum seekers and irregular migrants. However, these individuals often find themselves in Malta after encountering difficulties in the seas nearby while trying to get to mainland Europe, as it is a country of first arrival in the Central Mediterranean, which, up until recently, had a large search and rescue region.6   Taking into account Malta’s population of approximately 518,000 people,7 the ratio of asylum seekers to the population is one of the highest in Europe.8 This has caused “significant repercussions [in the country] in terms of resources and accommodation logistics, as well as in relation to other key aspects, including international protection, integration as well as the return of those found not to be deserving of international protection.”9   A.  Statistics   Malta struggled with large number of asylum seekers from 2002,10 although the number of applications received in recent years has dropped substantially. Malta received 4,021 applications for asylum in 2019. This dropped by almost half in 2020 to 2,419, by half again in 2021, when Malta received 1,281 applications,11 and to 913 in 2022.12 The drop in numbers can possibly be attributed to a “drastic[] decrease” in the Armed Forces of Malta’s sea patrols,13 along with a memorandum of understanding with Libya that aims to strengthen cooperation and combat human traffickers both on land and at sea.14   2 Constitution of Malta (Const.), https://perma.cc/XPM8-2DSG.  3 Malta in the EU, Eur.

Most of these children originated from Sudan (22%), Somalia (21%), Bangladesh (15%) and Eritrea (14%). In 2022, 17 individuals were assessed as unaccompanied minors and 10 as separated children. During the registration period for international protection, 33 individuals changed their date of birth, and nine of those were assessed as minors.17  B.  Legislative Framework   Malta is a signatory to the Refugee Convention of July 28, 1951, and its protocol. As an EU member, Malta has transposed into its national laws a number of EU directives providing common standards that define who qualifies for international protection and set the procedures for granting and withdrawing international protection.18  The International Protection Act (IPA) provides the framework for those seeking international protection and refugee status in Malta. Article 2 of the act defines the term refugee as  a third country national who, owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former habitual residence, as a result of such events is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it.19  Acts of persecution are defined as   (a) acts of physical or mental violence, including acts of sexual violence; (b) legal, administrative, police, and/or judicial measures  (c) prosecution or punishment which is disproportionate or discriminatory; (d) denial of judicial redress resulting in a disproportionate or discriminatory manner;  15 UNHCR, supra note 12. 16 Aditus Found., Aida Asylum Information Database Country Report: Malta, supra note 11, at 33. 17 UNHCR, supra note 12.  18 See, e.g., the Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations, SL 420.07, https://perma.cc/9JL9-BKGJ; Reception of Asylum Seekers Regulations, SL 420.06, https://perma.cc/JPE5-KGHB; Temporary Protection for Displaced Persons (Minimum Standards) Regulations, SL 420.05, https://perma.cc/2LWL-F7PC; and International Protection Appeals Tribunal (Procedures) Regulations, SL 420.01, https://perma.cc/U4C6-PA3Z. 19 International Protection Act (IPA) art. 2, https://perma.cc/XN2G-X4YW.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Malta The Law Library of Congress 113 (e) prosecution or punishment for refusal to perform military service in a conflict, where performing military service would include crimes or acts falling within the scope of the grounds for exclusion as set out in article 12(2); (f) acts of a gender-specific or child-specific nature.20  The events that cause the well-founded fear of persecution may arise after the applicant has left the country, or be based on acts the applicant has engaged in since they left the country of origin, unless this is “based on circumstances which the applicant has created by his own decision since leaving the country of origin.”21 Refugee status is granted to an individual in Malta “where it is established that he faces a well-founded fear of persecution in his country of origin or habitual residence in terms of the Convention.”22  The principle of non-refoulement, contained in article 33 of the UN Convention on Refugees, prohibits the return of refugees to a country where their lives or freedom would be threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion. Under Article 14 of the IPA, which incorporates the principle of non-refoulement into the national law of Malta, this prohibition does not apply to refugees when there are reasonable grounds to believe that they are a danger to the security of Malta or have been convicted of a serious crime and constitute a danger to the community.23   C.  Government Responsibilities  In Malta, the International Protection Agency (IPA) is responsible for all parts of the process for international protection, beginning with the registration, “examination and determination of eligibility for subsidiary protection being undertaken by the . . . IPA.”24 The Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS) is responsible for “the implementation of national legislation and policy concerning the welfare of refugees, persons enjoying international protection and asylum seekers.”25 It manages reception facilities and provides information for asylum seekers, facilitating services for these individuals from other public entities. It also works to promote government plans for resettlement and voluntary returns.26  All applications for asylum must be made at IPA premises.27 The IPA has three procedures under which an applicant for international protection may be processed: a regular procedure, an accelerated procedure,28 or the Dublin procedure. No time limit is specified during which an  20 Id. 21 Id. art 8. 22 Id.  23 Id. IPA art. 2.  24 IPA art. 4(3).

This procedure may be used for applications that are considered to be manifestly unfounded.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Malta The Law Library of Congress 114 asylum seeker must make or lodge an application. The law provides that the IPA cannot reject or exclude applications from examination because they were not made as soon as possible.29   II.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  The term “unaccompanied minor” is defined in article 2 of the IPA as   a person below the age of eighteen years who arrives in Malta unaccompanied by an adult responsible for him whether by law or by custom, for as long as he is not effectively taken into the care of such a person and includes any minor who is left unaccompanied after he has entered Malta.30  The term “minor” is defined in article 2 of the IPA as “a third country national or stateless person below the age of eighteen years.”31  The Reception of Asylum Seekers Regulation further defines unaccompanied minors as   persons below the age of eighteen who arrive in Malta unaccompanied by an adult responsible for them whether by law or by custom, and for as long as they are not effectively taken into the care of such a person; it includes minors who are left unaccompanied after they have entered Malta.32  III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  Article 24 of the IPA provides a number of grounds under which an application for international protection is considered inadmissible. In such cases, an accelerated examination procedure is used to determine whether the application is manifestly unfounded. Applicants are permitted to “present their views, with regard to the application, of the grounds referred to in this article before a decision on the admissibility of an application has been taken.”33   A.  First Country of Asylum   Article 24 of the IPA provides that applications for international protection are inadmissible if the applicant has been in a country that is considered to be a first country of asylum.34 The term “first country of asylum” is defined in article 2 of the IPA as a     29 Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations, reg. 8(1). 30 IPA art. 2. 31 Id. 32 Reception of Asylum Seekers Regulations, SL 420.06, reg. 2, https://perma.cc/4EWH-763V. This definition is also reflected in the Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations.  33 IPA art. 24. 34 Id. art. 24(b). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Malta The Law Library of Congress 115 country where an applicant for international protection:  (a) has been recognised in that country as a refugee and he can still avail himself of that protection; or   (b) he otherwise enjoys sufficient protection in that country including benefiting from the principle of non-refoulement and subject to re-admission to that country.35  Article 2(b) appears to cover countries that the asylum seeker has traveled through prior to arriving in Malta.   The IPA reported that it did not make any decisions on this basis in 2021; however, contrary reports were provided to the Asylum Information Database from non-governmental organizations (NGOs), which reported they had met applicants who had been granted protection in another country and later arrived in Malta, where applications for international protection were refused.36 According to the Asylum Information Database, the NGO’s concluded that the refusal of the IPA to accept such applications resulted in the lack of records regarding decisions taken under this article.37  B.  Safe Third Countries   The IPA contains the concept of a “safe third country.”38 Article 23 of the act provides that an application for international protection in Malta is inadmissible if the applicant has resided in a safe third country for a “meaningful period of time prior to his entry to Malta.”39 Article 2 of this act defines “safe third country” as   a country of which the applicant is not a national or citizen and where –  (a) life and liberty are not threatened on account of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion;  (b) the principle of non-refoulement in accordance with the Convention is respected; (c) the prohibition of removal, in violation of the right to freedom from torture and cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment as laid down in international law, is respected;  35 Id. art. 2.  36 Country Report: Malta, Safe Third Country, Asylum Info.

The latter confirmed that no decision has been taken on the basis of this concept in 2020 and 2021. NGOs and lawyers confirmed that, in their experience, the principle is never used.41   C.  Safe Country of Origin  Malta includes the safe country of origin principle in its laws. This provides that applications from those whose country of origin is designated as safe are considered to be manifestly unfounded, which results in an accelerated procedure, where applicants must show they have serious grounds for considering the country is not safe in their particular circumstances.42 There is no right of appeal to any decision made on these grounds.   The IPA is responsible for designating safe third countries, and those designated as such are listed in the schedule to the Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations.43   D.  Exceptions for Unaccompanied Minors  There do not appear to be any exceptions for unaccompanied minors under the above provisions. Article 24A of the IPA specifically provides that unaccompanied minors may be examined using the accelerated procedure when they   40 Id. art. 2. 41 Country Report: Malta, Safe Third Country, Asylum Info.

Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Arrival   Article 13 of the IPA provides that any person under the age of 18 “who is found under circumstances which clearly indicate that he is a child or young person in need of care, shall be allowed to apply for international protection.”45   The Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers (AWAS)46 is responsible for screening asylum seekers for vulnerability.47 At the point of disembarkation, “only persons who are manifestly and visibly vulnerable (e.g., families with young children) are identified and flagged by AWAS.”48 Others who may be flagged as vulnerable include unaccompanied minors, those with serious chronic illnesses, the mentally ill, individuals over 60 years of age, the physically disabled, and those with psychological problems.49 The policy is to process unaccompanied minors and other vulnerable individuals ahead of other asylum seekers upon their arrival at the examination area.50   Unaccompanied minors who declare they are below 18 years of age when they enter Malta, or provide this information on their application form, are automatically referred to AWAS. It assesses the age of those whose age is in question, and the assessment must be completed within six days of the child’s arrival.51 A report from the Council of Europe found there were no protocols and procedures in place to identify unaccompanied minors on arrival or during detention and that “identification remains ad hoc based on NGO or AWAS observation.”52    44 IPA art. 23A.  45 Id. art. 13. 46 Agency for the Welfare of Asylum Seekers Regulations, SL217.11, https://perma.cc/3R6U-4WUU.  47 Id.  48 Aditus Found., Aida Asylum Information Database Country Report: Malta, supra note 11, at 58. 49 Id. 50 Home Aff., supra note 1, at 8. 51 Id. at 60. 52 Council of Europe, Grevio Baseline Evaluation Report: Malta ¶ 250 (Nov. 23, 2020), https://perma.cc/F8PK-3J6J.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Malta The Law Library of Congress 118 B.  Processing Unaccompanied Minors  Unaccompanied minors are placed in an initial reception center for medical screening and processing. At the initial reception center, they are then informed of their right to apply for international protection by the Office of the Refugee Commissioner. A case worker is assigned to each irregular migrant, who follows them through the initial reception phase. The policy guidance notes that the initial reception facility must make efforts “to provide minors with physical reception conditions and activities appropriate to their age.”53 The stay at the initial reception facility should typically be no longer than seven days, but may be extended if the health of the asylum seeker requires it. If the stay needs to be extended, the health authorities must inform the irregular immigrant of the reasons why “in a language they may be reasonably supposed to understand.”54   After unaccompanied minors have undergone the intake process, they are then accommodated at AWAS-run centers that are designed to meet the specific needs of minors in a “homely and child-friendly environment,”55 or they are released to adult relatives or a foster family.56 With regard to the age and maturity of the minors, their views are taken into account when determining whose custody they are released into.57   The centers and services provided there must   • respect the personal safety and confidentiality of residents,  • provide for their basic needs, and  • respect ethnic and cultural diversity.58  The procedural regulations require that any changes in residence of an unaccompanied minor must be kept to a minimum.59  C.  Role of Child Protection Agencies  There are a number of laws that require the notification of the relevant agencies when a person comes into contact with a person claiming to be an unaccompanied minor. The IPA is under a legal duty to inform the competent authorities immediately when an unaccompanied minor makes an application for international protection.60 The Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act  53 Home Aff., supra note 1, at 14. 54 Id. 55 Id. at 20.

The Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act requires the chief executive officer of AWAS to cooperate with child protection director.63   Once the minor has been registered and issued an identification document, the child protection director must ask a court to appoint a representative to support and assist the minor with the procedures contained in the IPA. AWAS is typically appointed as the legal guardian of the child.64  The person or entity charged in the care order with the care and custody of the minor is responsible for assisting and supporting the minor, such as by identifying the persons or entities that may be involved in the care, custody, and protection of the minor; coordinating the work of these persons or entities; and ensuring that the minor is offered care, accommodation, education and medical care without delay.65 All decisions relating to the minor must be taken in the best interests of the child.66  D.  Age Assessment   The child protection director is responsible for referring the unaccompanied minor to AWAS so it can “undertake those investigations and evaluations as they deem appropriate to determine whether the minor is in fact an unaccompanied minor.”67 The Strategy for the Reception of Asylum Seekers and Irregular Migrants (Strategy) states that an age assessment is undertaken in all cases of unaccompanied minors, except for those who “are undoubtedly children.”68 Age assessments must occur within “a reasonable period of time after an application for international protection has been lodged.”69 They are conducted by AWAS, with support from the European Union Agency for Asylum (EASO) using “psycho-social assessment procedures approved by AWAS management.”70   The person or entity with care and custody of the child must accompany the minor and represent the child during the age assessment and any other investigations or evaluations conducted by  61 Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act cap. 602, https://perma.cc/BB9F-V6HM.  62 Id. art. 21.  63 Id. 64 Id.

Malta uses medical age assessment procedures “as a last resort when the age of the migrant in question remains in doubt.”72 The Procedural Regulations state that unaccompanied minors must be informed of the consequences of refusing to undergo an age assessment procedure, “which may include the rejection of the application.”73 However, the regulation provides that refusing to undergo the age assessment cannot be the sole grounds for the refusal of an application.74   The age assessment procedures in Malta have been criticized by the European Council on Refugees and Exiles as being “plagued by a lack of adequate procedural guarantees, including a lack of information about the procedure.”75   E.  Protection Orders  Once the age assessment procedures establish that the applicant is an unaccompanied minor, the child protection director must submit a request to the court for a protection order and prepare a care plan to be filed with the application. Once the court is satisfied that the person named in the order is an unaccompanied minor and that the care plan is appropriate, it must issue the protection order. The court can impose other conditions that it sees as appropriate, such as placing the minor in the care and custody of the chief executive officer of AWAS or another competent authority or entity, without the need for a hearing.76 If the court is not satisfied that the care plan is appropriate, it must schedule a hearing to be held within 10 working days, and the court appoints curators (guardians) to represent both parents, at which point the court will give a final decision on the protection order.   The final protection order continues in force until the unaccompanied minor reaches the age of 18 or it is revoked by the court.77 Prior to revoking the protective order, the court must consider any recommendations from the Minors Care Review Board and the reasons for the recommendations. It must also consider the views of the following individuals:  • The minor, if the child is deemed to have a sufficient understanding of the proceedings,  • the children’s advocate,78   71 Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act, art. 21(3)(h).  72 Home Aff., supra note 1, at 15. 73 Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations. 74 Id. 75 Aditus Found., Aida Asylum Information Database Country Report: Malta, supra note 11. 76 Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act art. 21(6). 77 Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act arts. 21(7), 22; Code of Organization and Civil Procedure cap. 12, art. 930, https://perma.cc/B5GH-2QUL. 78 A children’s advocate must have “receive[d] such relevant training so as to effectively represent and safeguard the views and wishes of the minor . . . when the Children’s Advocate is to be engaged in relation to an unaccompanied minor the relevant Children’s Advocate should also receive or have received training on \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Malta The Law Library of Congress 121 • the parent or parents,  • the key social worker,  • the alternative caregiver,  • the tutor and/or the curator (guardian or conservator), and  • any other person the court deems appropriate.79   In cases where the “court determines that there are sufficient reasons to revoke a protection order, it shall refer the case to the Review Board in order to prepare a reintegration plan.”80  If the age assessment procedure determines the asylum seeker claiming to be a minor is an adult, the child protection director must apply to the court to revoke the first decree and, if the court is satisfied the applicant is not an unaccompanied minor, it may do so. The applicant is then referred to the police, who consider all the circumstances of the case to decide whether a detention order should be issued.81 If the court is not satisfied the applicant is not an unaccompanied minor, a hearing must be held within 10 working days. The court appoints guardians to represent both parents, at which point the court will give a final decision.82   There is a right to an appeal when the age assessment determines the applicant is over the age of 18,83 but the European Council on Refugees and Exiles has reported that “[t]he duration of age assessment appeals is significant, with nearly all cases filed in 2021 still pending in January 2022. This leads to situations where the appellants abandon their appeals or simply turn 18 before any decision is issued.”84   F.  Legal Representation  The Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act specifically requires the person or entity entrusted with the care and custody of a minor to “ensure that the minor has suitable legal and judicial representation and assistance with regards to his residence status, his request for asylum, or for any other legal or administrative procedures.”85 The person or entity with care and custody of the child are further required to “submit the views of the minor in any court or before any  the problems and issues affecting migrant children and children seeking international protection.” Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act art. 25(2). 79 Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act art. 22. 80 Id. art. 22(4). 81 Home Aff., supra note 1, at 11. 82 Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act art. 21(7); Code of Organization and Civil Procedure cap. 12, art. 930. 83 Special Reception Needs of Vulnerable Groups: Malta, Asylum Info.

Where an organisation is appointed as a representative, it shall designate a person responsible for carrying out the duties of a representative in respect of the unaccompanied minor.89  The representative is required to “perform his duties in the best interests of the minor and . . . have the necessary knowledge of the special needs of minors.”90 The representative must inform the unaccompanied minor about the interview for international protection, its meaning, and the consequences that flow from the interview. Where appropriate, the representative must also inform the minor about how to prepare him or herself for the interview. The representative must be present during the interview and can “ask questions or make comments within the framework set by the person who conducts the interview.”91  The requirement for representation is reflected in both the Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations and the Reception of Asylum Seekers Regulations.92 The Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations further provide that unaccompanied minors must be provided with legal and procedural information free of charge.93   While there have been a number of criticisms about the international protection process for unaccompanied minors, the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) determined that access to asylum procedures for unaccompanied minors had “greatly improved through 2022.”94    86 Id. art. 21(3)(f). 87 Id. art. 21(3)(g). 88 IPA art. 13.

Temporary Humanitarian Protection  The IPA may grant temporary humanitarian protection for applicants who do not qualify for refugee status or subsidiary protection status if they are deemed to qualify for protection on humanitarian grounds. This may apply to “unaccompanied minor[s] who cannot be returned to [their] country of origin pursuant to the principle of the best interests of the child.”95  V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  In 2016, the European Court of Human Rights ruled that Malta had violated articles 3 and 5(4) of the convention when it detained two children seeking asylum for eight months to determine their age. The court concluded that “[a] detention order for the sole reason of State bureaucratic convenience equates the targeted people with commodities.”96 Following the judgment, Malta amended its Reception Regulations to prohibit the detention of vulnerable applicants, including unaccompanied minors. The regulations state,   (1)(c) . . . Provided that applicants identified as minors shall not be detained, except as a measure of last resort:   Provided further that applicants who claim to be minors shall not be detained, except as a measure of last resort, unless the claim is evidently and manifestly unfounded.   (2) Whenever the vulnerability of an applicant becomes apparent at a later stage, assistance and support shall be provided from that point onwards, pursuant to a reassessment of the case.  (3) Whenever the vulnerability of an applicant is ascertained, no detention order shall be issued or, if such an order has already been issued, it shall be revoked with immediate effect.97  Thus, the regulations provide that whenever the vulnerability of an applicant is ascertained, no detention order will be issued or, if such an order has already been issued, it must be revoked with immediate effect.98 It appears to leave open the detention of applicants who do not undoubtedly look like a minor to have their age ascertained. Further, the Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act provides that “whenever possible the minor shall not be placed in detention or in accommodation with persons who are not minors,”99 although the Reception of Asylum Seekers Regulations state that unaccompanied minors aged 16 and over can be placed in accommodation with adult asylum seekers.100   95 IPA art. 17A(1)(a). 96 Abdullahi Elmi and Aweys Abubakar v.

During this period of detention, all asylum seekers except families and young children are detained, including individuals claiming to be minors.105  As noted above, the regulations provide that when a vulnerability “becomes apparent at a later stage, assistance and support is provided from that point onwards.”106 To provide the law and policy with effect, Malta uses the age assessment procedure discussed in Part IV.D above, to determine whether an applicant is a minor. A report with a recommendation is provided after the assessment, and if the report “concludes the person is vulnerable, he/she is automatically released from detention in case she/he is detained and transferred to the IRC where he/she is seen by the Therapeutic Unit. They are eventually transferred to an open centre.”107   A report from the Council of Europe has stated the detention continues in some cases even after the applicant has been determined to be a minor if there are no spaces available at the open centers.108 The report from the Council of Europe was based on an evaluation during September  101 Home Aff., supra note 1, at 13. 102 Asylum Info.

The number of individuals seeking asylum has dropped by over 60% since that time, but we have been unable to locate an updated report to determine whether crowding remains an issue. A habeas corpus action filed in January 2022 for three confirmed minors and four others awaiting an age assessment who had been detained for two months, and another case filed with the Immigration Appeal Board in March 2022, indicate that Malta continues to detain children, in this case alongside adults, pending the determination of an age assessment.109 UNHCR Malta and NGOs have condemned Malta’s continued detention of children.110  Malta reportedly uses an open reception center to cater for individuals who are clearly unaccompanied minors. For those whose age is uncertain, no alternatives to detention appear to be used before the age assessment.   There are a few avenues through which detainees may appeal their detention. They may file an application for judicial review under the civil code,111 challenge the lawfulness of the detention under article 34 of the Constitution,112 and contest their detention under article 5 of the European Convention on Human Rights.

Conditions of Detention  Article 14 of the Reception Regulations provides that in “the implementation of the provisions relating to material reception conditions and health care, including mental health, account shall be taken of the specific situation of vulnerable persons who shall include minors, unaccompanied minors.”113 This regulation further provides that AWAS must ensure support is provided to applicants who have special reception needs and take these needs into account during the entire asylum procedure.114  The Detention Regulations provide that detention centers must “provide for the secure but humane accommodation of detained persons . . . allowing as much freedom as possible, consistent with maintaining a safe and secure environment.”115 These regulations provide that detainees must be provided with at least one hour in the open air each day and “activities to meet their recreational needs.”116 Educational programs may be provided at detention centers, and a library must be provided at each center.117    109 Aditus Found., Malta Still Detains Children with Adults in Safi Detention Centre (Apr. 10, 2022), https://perma.cc/S9VL-PM78.  110 Detention of Vulnerable Minors: Malta, Asylum Info.

A report from the Council of Europe found that, at the time of a visit in September 2020, the open centers were at capacity, and unaccompanied minors were held with adults, including single males, in cramped and poor conditions.118 The report noted the detention did not provide the unaccompanied minors with “access to any activities, education, or even the exercise yard to play games,” and it noted “the lack of any psychosocial support or tailored programmes for children and other vulnerable groups.”119 The report observed, “these establishments are not designed to cater for children, and not only are they inadequate in terms of material conditions, they also completely lack an adequate regime and any specific care provision to cater to the best interests of the child.”120 A 2021 report found that unaccompanied minors were “not attending school and were not involved in other meaningful activities.”121  The University of Malta reported that unaccompanied minors of 16 and 17 years of age who were awaiting age assessments were routinely held with adults, which “violates the legal obligation to consider children as persons under the age of 18.”122 The European Council on Refugees and Exiles found that detained applicants were held in unsanitary conditions due to overcrowding, with “limited access to day light, clean water and sanitation.”123 It further found that detainees were not provided with reading materials or leisure activities. The Malta Chamber of Psychologists, while acknowledging the disproportionate burden faced by Malta caused by irregular migration, stated that detainees were subject to inhumane conditions that had a major negative impact on the mental health of those held.124  B.  Educational and Humanitarian Programs Offered in Detention  School is mandatory for children from 5 to 16 years of age, regardless of the child’s immigration status.125 Minors have access to public school education at no charge,126 and those who do not speak English or Maltese are provided with an induction course for up to a year to prepare them for mainstream classes.127   118 Letter from Ruth Farrugia et al. to Minister for Children (Oct. 24, 2019), Malta Today, https://perma.cc/8RVD-HC8Z. 119 Council Eur., Report to the Maltese Government on the Visit to Malta Carried Out by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment, supra note 108, at ¶ 59. 120 Id. 121 Aditus Found., Aida Asylum Information Database Country Report: Malta, supra note 11, at 85. 122 Farrugia et al., supra note 19.  123 Conditions in Detention Facilities: Malta, Asylum Info.

C.  Repatriation   As noted in Part I.B above, article 14 of the IPA enshrines the prohibition of refoulement into the domestic laws of Malta and prohibits the return of asylum seekers to countries where their “life or freedom would [would be] threatened on account of his race, religion, national, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.”132  Applicants, including unaccompanied minors, whose applications are rejected are typically issued a return decision and removal order.133 The return decision states the reasons the individual is a prohibited immigrant and that there is the possibility to apply for voluntary departure from Malta. If voluntary departure is rejected, a removal order is issued that states the applicant will be detained until removal occurs. There is a right to appeal both the decision and the removal order before the Immigration Appeals Board, which must be filed within three working days of the decision.134  Article 15 of the IPA provides that recognized refugees or those with subsidiary protection may submit a written request to the minister for settlement to another country and requires the minister to do all that is required to help with this purpose.

The support, which is provided after the individual has applied and been approved by ERRIN, includes airport pickup and assistance, travel assistance in the country of origin, and the provision of basic essentials and temporary housing along with long-term housing support. Further assistance is available, such as help setting up a small business, support locating job placements, and support for vocational training, school, and language training along with social, legal, and medical support.136  VI.  Resettlement and Integration Programs  In 2017, Malta adopted its first integration strategy.137 Malta’s first integration program, known as the “I Belong” program, was launched in 2018.138 The “I Belong” program is one of the main pillars of the integration strategy.139 It is funded by the European Union’s Asylum, Migration and Integration Fund and the Maltese government.140 “I Belong” consists of a series of courses on both the English and Maltese languages and on cultural orientation to help immigrants integrate into Maltese society. A formal application must be submitted to be accepted for the program. The complete program totals 230 hours of education and requires an 80% attendance rate and 50% pass mark to obtain a certificate.141  The Intercultural and Anti-Racism Unit within the Human Rights Directorate is responsible for the implementation of the strategy and action plan .142 It “serves as the main governmental coordinating body that imparts information, receives integration requests and follows migrants’ progress on their integration in Malta.”143 The unit is responsible for “assist[ing] all persons of migrant background residing in Malta on their individual path to integration.”144    135 About ERRIN, Eur.

Family Reunification  Once an unaccompanied minor is determined to be a refugee, AWAS begins procedures to trace any family members if it is in the best interests of the child. AWAS receives the assistance of international organizations when necessary.145 Applicants for refugee status who do not yet have a decision, and those granted subsidiary protection, are not eligible to apply for family reunification.146  The Procedural Regulations provide that,  in cases where there may be a threat to the life or integrity of the minor himself or his close relatives, particularly if they have remained in the country of origin, care must be taken to ensure that the collection, processing and circulation of information concerning these persons is undertaken on a confidential basis147  Where family members are identified, further action is taken if it is in the best interests of the child,148 “possibly with a view to reuniting the minor with his or her family members.”149   The Family Reunification Regulations provide that family reunification for unaccompanied minors is only available for “first-degree relatives in the direct ascending line.”150 If the unaccompanied minor does not have such a relative, or the relative cannot be traced, the entry and residence of their legal guardian or other member of the family may be authorized.151 Documentary evidence of the relationship should be shown. If this evidence is not available, information and other evidence during the examination of the application may be taken into account, and not having this documentation alone will not cause the application to fail.152 The requirement for sponsors to have lawfully resided in Malta for two years does not apply in the case of recognized refugees.153  Applications for family reunification should be made within three months of the date the applicant was granted refugee status. Applications submitted after this time require evidence that the sponsor has suitable family accommodations and stable and regular resources that are not social benefits and are equivalent to the statutory minimum wage in Malta.154   145 Procedural Standards for Granting and Withdrawing International Protection Regulations, reg. 18(4). 146 Id. reg. 3.  147 Id. 148 Minor Protection (Alternative Care) Act, cap. 602, art. 21(4). 149 Home Aff., supra note 1, at 18. 150 Family Reunification Regulations, SL 217.06, reg. 24, https://perma.cc/JHZ7-HGWB.  151 Id.  152 Id. reg. 25. 153 Id. reg. 27. 154 Id.

Problems may arise during this process in countries without a Maltese embassy and subsequently require family members to travel to countries have one.155 Once family members who are able to obtain a visa arrive in Malta, they are granted a renewable residence permit for one year.156 Family members are able to access education and vocational guidance and training. Within the first 12 months of their arrival, they also may obtain employment and self-employment but must have an employment license, which requires an assessment of the situation of the labor market.157 Additional conditions may be attached to the residence permit requiring the sponsor and family members to successfully attend and complete courses in Maltese.158   155 Status & Rights of Family Members: Malta, Asylum Info.

Without special status, unaccompanied minors are not granted specific protections of rights guaranteed by international law. Minors located in Russia are subject to childhood protection regulations, and child protection agencies are involved in deciding whether a child should be returned home or placed in a state institution. Repatriation of migrant children within the Commonwealth of Independent States is conducted in accordance with an international agreement, but as to minors from countries not party to this agreement, courts rarely order deportation.    I.  Introduction  Migration is an important social, economic, and political factor in Russia.   According to [International Organization for Migration] estimates, for many years Russia has held second place, behind the United States, for the number of foreigners present in the country. It is also second in Europe, after Germany, for the number of migrants. According to the OECD, Russia has the highest number of illegal migrants in the world, comprising almost 7% of the country’s population; whereas legal migrant workers comprise 2.5% of the population.1    Before the pandemic, the country received around 15 million foreign migrants per year. In 2021 and 2022, due to the pandemic, the number of migrants decreased by approximately one-half.2  Around 52% of migrants are labor migrants. Russia remains a favorable labor market for citizens of the former Soviet republics.  In 2021, 22% of Russia’s migrants came from Ukraine (1.6 million), 20% came from Uzbekistan (1.5 million), 14% came from Tajikistan (1 million) and 9% (660,000) arrived from Kazakhstan and Kyrgyzstan each.3 Approximately 1 million of those who migrated to Russia in 2021 were under the age of 18.4 No information on the numbers of unaccompanied or undocumented minor migrants was found.      1 Integral Human Development, Country Profiles: Russia, Exec.

The Migration Directorate has regional branches in each constituent component of the Russian Federation. In dealings with migrants under the age of 18, the Migration Directorate is required to work with regional and local institutions for the protection of children and guardianship.     On May 1, 2022, the Supreme Court of Russia published a summary of migration-related positions and practice of international organizations working in the field of human rights protection as guidance for lower courts on how to ensure the rights of migrants in court rulings.5 Section 13 of the document enumerates guarantees for migrant children, including rights to registration and identification, protection of personal data, family life, protection from exploitation and violence, health care, education, personal inviolability, return to one’s home country, access to justice, and other issues.  The main domestic legal act regulating migration is the Federal Law on the Legal Status of Foreign Nationals in the Russian Federation.6 This law does not address minors as a separate category of migrants. Children who arrived together with their parents or legal guardians are viewed as members of their family and are subject to general migration regulations.    Legally, only minors older than 16 years of age can enter Russia unaccompanied, and only if they possess a written consent from their parents or guardians.7 Usually, minors may arrive to Russia for varied private purposes or for education in a state-accredited educational institution. Migration of minors for work is not allowed because it is illegal to employ foreign and stateless individuals under the age of 18. Minors are required to live and move inside the country together with their parents or guardians. They are subject to the migrants’ registration for their family, and the term of their permitted presence in the country is that established for their parents.8      Humanitarian protection is regulated by the Federal Law on Refugees.9 The law provides for recognizing refugees, and for granting the right to reside in Russia to those without refugee status who have sufficient humanitarian reasons for protection.  In matters involving children, acts regulating the legal status of children and their rights should be taken into account. These include the Family Code of the Russian Federation,10 the Federal  5 Supreme Court of the Russian Federation, Summary of the Practice and Legal Positions of International Human Rights Organizations in Regard to Protection of Migrants’ Rights (May 1, 2022), https://perma.cc/FM5U-2RLU (in Russian).   6 Federal Law on the Legal Status of Foreign Citizens in the Russian Federation, No. 115-FZ, adopted on July 25, 2002, last amended on Dec. 29, 2022, https://perma.cc/K675-3B3Y (in Russian). 7 Id. art. 6. 8 Id. 9 Federal Law on Refugees, No. 4528-1, adopted on Feb. 19, 1993, last amended on July 14, 2022, https://perma.cc/Y9UQ-7JXS (in Russian). 10 Family Code of the Russian Federation, No. 223-FZ, adopted on Dec. 29, 1995, last amended on Dec. 19, 2022, https://perma.cc/8FX8-ZSQC (in Russian). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 133 Law on Guardianship and Custody,11 and the Federal Law on the Basic Guarantees of the Rights of the Child in the Russian Federation.12 According to these laws, a minor is a person under 18 years of age. The place of residence of a child under the age of 14 is determined by the place of residence of his parents or legal representatives; the establishment of guardianship for children left without parental care is required.13  Presently, the treatment of unaccompanied minor migrants appears to be unregulated under Russian law, and contradictory provisions seem to complicate resolution of legal issues that arise. A legal scholar recommended the following administrative measures aimed at improving protection of unaccompanied minor migrants:  • Establish mandatory registration of migrant children • Ensure exchange of information and coordination between migration authorities and child protection institutions • Define processes to hold minors responsible for administrative violations of migration procedures • Determine the procedure for identification of unaccompanied minor migrants who are undocumented • Take into account the legal status of minor unaccompanied foreigners when they are administratively removed, deported, or readmitted14  II.  Defining Unaccompanied Minors  Unaccompanied minors are not distinguished as a separate category of migrants.  Without special status, unaccompanied migrant children in Russia do not enjoy the specific protections that are supposed to be guaranteed under international law. According to a research paper, Russian law does not recognize the concept of unaccompanied child migrants, despite Russia’s ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990.   The wording “unaccompanied and separated children” is not mentioned in legal acts related to children or to migrants. But if mentioned, it would be understood and interpreted within the national context of regulation of children’s rights.    11 Federal Law on Guardianship and Custody, No. 48-FZ, adopted on Apr. 24, 2008, last amended on Apr. 30, 2021, arts. 6, 13, https://perma.cc/U75H-XAL4 (in Russian). 12 Federal Law on the Basic Guarantees of the Rights of the Child in the Russian Federation, No. 124-FZ, adopted on July 24, 1998, last amended on Dec. 29, 2022, https://perma.cc/YUX2-REL8 (in Russian). 13 Family Code, art. 145. 14 N.V.

[a] child separated from parents would be labeled “a child left without parental care” [and would be treated as having been] abandoned or neglected by the parents.15   In order to find a placement for a child, a local state authority dealing with protection of children’s rights will decide whether to attempt to return the child to his or her home country or place the child within a state institution.16    III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  Because unaccompanied children are not defined as migrants or given a specified migrant status, Russian law fails to guarantee protection of basic rights.17 Not having recognition as a special migrant category, unaccompanied minors are subject to regular asylum application procedures.  It is not clear if minors can submit asylum claims without parental consent, and no decision on granting asylum to an unaccompanied minor has been found. A regular application for asylum must be submitted in person to the local office of the Internal Affairs Ministry within seven days after a petitioner’s arrival in Russia or the establishment of circumstances preventing their return to the country of citizenship or permanent residence.18 A petition for humanitarian protection and refugee status can be submitted to a diplomatic or consular office of the Russian Federation abroad. The diplomatic office then conducts a preliminary review and, in case of favorable resolution, issues a temporary protection certificate, which allows entry into Russia, where the decision on granting refugee status is made by the authorities.19   IV. Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Visas  To enter Russia legally, children need to be in possession of their own visa and passport. Visa applications from children are reviewed in the same way as those of adults and should be submitted together with their parents’ visa applications. There are no special visas for children.20       15 Natalya V. Kravchuk, Re-Defining Unaccompanied and Separated Children in Russia, 2016 Law: J. Higher Sch.

Legal Representation  Russian law requires that cases of administrative violations committed by minors be resolved by the local commission on the affairs of minors and protection of their rights. The participation of the minor’s legal representative in administrative proceedings is mandatory. Because parents or guardians of an unaccompanied minor migrant are not present, the law does not allow such local commissions to resolve the case, and no decision can be made when an unaccompanied minor migrant is accused of violations. The law does not allow appointment of a temporary legal representative for an unaccompanied minor migrant.21  C. Role of Child Protection Agencies  Child protection agencies are involved in resolving issues related to “children in difficult life situations” and those who are without parental control and placed in federal institutions.22 These institutions do not distinguish between Russian and migrant children with regard to treatment. They serve as legal representatives of unaccompanied minor migrants when these minors are identified and placed in federal institutions for children without parental control. The participation of child protection agencies in court proceedings is required in cases with unaccompanied minor migrants.23   V.  Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied Minors  If an undocumented minor cannot be properly identified, has no place of residence, or committed a legal offense in an administrative unit he or she does not reside, a minor who has reached the age of administrative responsibility (16 years) can be placed in a center for temporary detention of minor offenders.24 However, this placement does not resolve the problem of punishment and further release. Because the procedure for identification of an undocumented minor migrant is not established by legislation precisely, local courts often refuse to accept cases of undocumented foreign minors. That usually extends the period in which a minor migrant is held in a detention center.25    With respect to repatriation, minors who arrived from a member state of the Commonwealth of Independent States and certain other countries are returned to their home country pursuant to the Agreement on Cooperation in Return of Minors to the States of their Permanent Residency.26 Together with Russia, this agreement was signed by Azerbaijan, Armenia, Belarus, Georgia,  21 Zinchenko et al., supra note 17. 22 Federal Law on the Basic Guarantees of the Rights of the Child in the Russian Federation, art. 15. 23 Id. 24 Federal Law on Foundations of the System of Prevention of Underage Vagrancy and Juvenile Delinquency, No. 120-FZ, adopted on June 24, 1999, last amended on Nov. 21, 2022, https://perma.cc/J83E-VPZ9 (in Russian).  25 Poliakova, supra note 14. 26 Agreement Among the Commonwealth of Independent States Member States on Cooperation in Questions of Returning Minors to the States of their Permanent Residency, October 7, 2002, https://perma.cc/5RFU-Y2BA (in Russian).  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Russian Federation The Law Library of Congress 136 Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Ukraine. Minors from these states are transferred to representatives of their states’ authorities, or are brought back to the home country accompanied by staff of the detention center and given to their legal representatives or to the institutions of child protection and guardianship.   With respect to minors from countries not part of this agreement, scholars have noted that return of minors to their home countries is complicated by the difficulty of locating the child’s parent or guardian or transferring the child to guardianship authorities. As a result, Russian courts rarely order deportation of unaccompanied minors to such countries.27   Researchers have noted that under current Russian deportation rules and procedures, which address adults only, minors are often separated from their parents by Russian law enforcement and become unaccompanied migrant children.28 Because children under 16 cannot be held liable for violations of migration laws, Russian courts usually order the deportation of foreigners in violation of migration law without their children. The law does not provide funding for deporting children under 16 years, and does not allow placement of a minor in migrant detention centers run by the Ministry of Internal Affairs where migrants are held until removal occurs.29 Before a child’s deportation order is issued, it is the duty of the court to review if the child’s parents or legal guardians have financial means to pay for their child’s transfer. If parents are unable to or refuse to pay, the court can consider whether donations or of assistance from the local immigrant community is available.30   Separation also occurs when courts order self-deportation of a migrant and prohibit his or her return to Russia for a specific period of time. Because the court lacks authority to include the child in the deportation order, this minor often remains in Russia without supervision from parents or guardians.31   No information was located about established educational programs for unaccompanied minors. Current Russian regulations allow placement of foreign minors in public educational institutions if they are children of documented migrants who are present in Russia legally.32 In 2022, the period of temporary registration for migrant children was extended from 90 days to the duration of their parents’ work permit, allowing them to continue to attend school.33  27 Poliakova, supra note 14. 28 Sergey Mikheev, Separation of Migrant Parents from Their Children: Violation of the Convention on the Rights of the Child, ADC Memorial (2017), https://perma.cc/847W-UXH4 (in Russian). 29 Protection of the Rights of Minors in the Expulsion of Foreign Citizens—Legal Representatives of Children, State Services, Dinskoi District (Krasnodar) Office of Family and Childhood, https://perma.cc/EEN6-FA8W (in Russian). 30 Id. 31 Id. 32 Sergey Chetverkin, Information on the Rights of Children of Migrants in the Russian Federation, Staff-House, https://perma.cc/P5VS-RRL7 (in Russian). 33 Victoria Kartasheva, Children of Labor Migrants Were Offered to Extend the Terms of Stay in Russia, Parlamentskaia Gazeta (Dec. 1, 2021), https://perma.cc/M3YW-YGGQ (in Russian).   \fThe Law Library of Congress 137 Turkey Kayahan Cantekin Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Turkey currently hosts more than 3.7 million refugees or asylum seekers, 1.7 million of whom are children. There is no publicly available and reliable data regarding the number of unaccompanied minors among this current child population, or the number of refugees or asylum seekers who were unaccompanied minors when they were first processed by immigration authorities. Turkish asylum law provides for certain procedural and welfare measures protecting unaccompanied foreign minors who enter the country, and mandates that all administrative processes involving these persons must be conducted in light of the best interest of the child. Unaccompanied foreign minors must be handed over to the care of the Ministry of Family and Social Services after their initial registration is done by immigration authorities. The Ministry is responsible for placing the child with responsible relatives, a foster family, or in an appropriate public childcare institution. Special protections afforded to unaccompanied minors in the asylum application process include requiring specially qualified personnel to be present during any interview with the minor, and a categorical exemption from administrative immigration detention. There are no special or accelerated procedures for obtaining asylum or a visa for unaccompanied foreign minors, however, special procedures are provided for family tracking and reunification. General provisions regarding repatriation and voluntary return apply to unaccompanied minors, but subject to the requirement that all administrative and judicial processes take into account the best interest of the child.   I. Introduction  A. Statistics and Categories of Asylum  1. Statistics  Turkey hosts the world’s largest population of refugees.1 A large majority of this population consists of Syrian nationals that sought protection in Turkey as a result of the Syrian Civil War that started in 2011. By April 6, 2023, according to the Ministry of Internal Affairs, 3,426,719 Syrian nationals were under “temporary protection,” a special asylum status that is applicable for Syrian nationals and persons seeking protection as part of the mass population movement occurring as a result of the war.2 The rest, which numbered about 318,000 people in mid-2022, are refugees  1 United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees: UN Refugee Agency (UNHCR), Türkiye Fact Sheet, February 2023, 1 (2023), https://perma.cc/GPV8-4LUR. 2 See Distribution of Syrians Under Temporary Protection by Year (2023), Presidency of Migration Management, https://perma.cc/6TPX-LVZC; Temporary Protection in Turkey, Presidency of Migration Management, https://perma.cc/TQ4G-2M62.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 138 and asylum seekers that have arrived from other places of the world.3 In 2022, 33,246 applications for asylum were made by persons not subject to the “temporary protection” regime.4 The different types of asylum status that exist in Turkish law will be explained below.  According to UNHCR data for the year 2021, Turkey hosted 1.7 million children (defined as persons under 18 years of age) who held some type of asylum status,5 and a further 123,000 children who were seeking asylum.6 However, there are no publicly available statistics about the share of unaccompanied foreign minors (UFMs) among these asylum status holder and asylum seeker populations.7  2. Categories of Asylum  The Turkish legal framework governing the provision of asylum differentiates between two main types of protection: “international protection” and “temporary protection.” This distinction wholly applies to UFMs with all of the legal consequences that follow from it.   a. International Protection  The international protection framework that is set forth by the Law on Foreigners and International Protection (LFIP)8 and its implementing regulation, the Regulation on the Implementation of the Law on Foreigners and International Protection (RFIP)9 is largely in line with the European Union laws governing the granting and withdrawing of protection to asylum seekers in the EU.  Turkey is a party to the 1951 Convention on the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol;10 it maintains the geographic limitation allowed by the Convention that limits protection to refugees that seek asylum in Turkey due to “events occurring in Europe.” As a result, the LFIP framework makes a tri-fold distinction between refugee status (that is, refugees that have the full range of rights and protections provided under the Convention, hereinafter referred to as “convention  3 UNHCR, supra note 1, at 1. 4 Up-to-Date Statistics – International Protection, Presidency of Migration Management, https://perma.cc/W88S-SLHX.   5 Refugee Data Finder (Population figures dataset query for Demographics: Refugees: Turkey), UNHCR, https://perma.cc/5RPC-BWKT. 6 Refugee Data Finder (Population figures dataset query for Demographics: Asylum-seekers: Turkey), UNHCR, https://perma.cc/9EM2-E33E. 7 See Ceday Avcı, Türkiye’de 750 Bin “Vatansız” Yenidoğan Var, Bianet.org (July 4, 2022), https://perma.cc/X5EL-E4EF (in Turkish). 8 Yabancılar ve Uluslararası Koruma Kanunu (LFIP), Law No. 6458, Official Gazette (O.G.)

See consolidated text of Convention and Protocol at https://perma.cc/H5FX-JT3Z. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 139 refugees” to avoid confusion), “conditional refugee” status, and subsidiary protection status, rather than the two-fold refugee/subsidiary protection distinction that exists in EU law.  The “conditional refugee” status is granted to asylum seekers that fulfil the eligibility criteria for refugee status as provided by the Convention, but are seeking protection from events occurring outside of Europe. The main difference between the convention refugee status and the conditional refugee status is that the latter is granted protection in Turkey “until resettled in a third country.”11 Moreover, the administration may require conditional refugees to reside in a predetermined area, and require them to periodically notify authorities of their whereabouts.12 Conditional refugees are not entitled to receive the “refugee travel document” (also known as the “Geneva Passport”) that is issued to convention refugees, and must apply for a single use travel document to leave or re-enter the country.13   The LFIP framework otherwise provides conditional refugees a level of protection similar to convention refugees; most importantly, conditional refugees cannot be returned to a place where they may be subjected to torture, inhuman or degrading punishment or treatment or, where their life or freedom would be threatened on account of their race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, or political opinion (the non-refoulement principle), and cannot be detained for the mere fact that they entered into the country to seek asylum, but only exceptionally for reasons such as determination of identity or a serious threat to public order or security.14  The third type of international protection is the “subsidiary protection” status, which is granted to foreigners who do not qualify as convention refugees or conditional refugees, but if returned to their country of origin or prior residence, will  a) be sentenced to death or face the execution of the death penalty;  b) face torture or inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment;  c) face serious threat to themselves by reason of indiscriminate violence in situations of international or nationwide armed conflict;  and therefore are unable or, for the reason of such threat, are unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of their country of origin or country of prior residence.15 Similar to conditional refugees, persons granted subsidiary protection may be required to reside in an area determined by the administration and to notify authorities of their whereabouts.16 They are also subject to the  11 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 62. 12 Id. art. 82. 13 Id. art. 84. 14 Id. art. 4. 15 Id. art. 63. 16 Id. art. 82. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 140 same rules regarding travel documents.17 Like convention refugees and conditional refugees, subsidiary protection status holders benefit from the non-refoulement principle.18  b. Temporary Protection  Article 91 of the LFIP provides the legal basis for the establishment of a special “temporary protection” status to provide protection, outside of the international protection framework, to persons who have arrived in Turkey to seek urgent and temporary refuge as part of a mass movement of people. On this basis, a temporary protection status was created by the Regulation on Temporary Protection (RTP).19 The RTP authorizes the President of the Republic to declare the scope of temporary protection.20 Currently, the RTP applies to all “citizens of the Syrian Arab Republic, stateless people and refugees, who have arrived in Turkey since April 28, 2011, whether individually or as part of a mass movement of people, due to events unfolding in Syria” and “citizens of the Syrian Arab Republic who have arrived in Turkey since April 28, 2011 due to events unfolding in Syria and, having crossed to the Aegean islands [i.e. Greek islands in the Aegean Sea] after March 20, 2016 via irregular ways, were readmitted to Turkey and have made an application for protection.”21 Like persons subject to the international protection regime, persons under temporary protection benefit from the principle of non-refoulement.22  B. Jurisdictional Responsibilities  The legal framework for asylum involves different institutions throughout the processing of an unaccompanied minor in the asylum system.   1. The Presidency of Migration Management and Provincial Directorates of Migration Management  The Presidency of Migration Management (PMM), which is organized under the Ministry of Internal Affairs, is responsible through its field offices (the Provincial Directorates of Migration Management (PDMMs)) to conduct the initial registration of persons seeking asylum within the territory of Turkey or at ports of entry.23 The PDMMs are required to make an assessment at initial registration regarding whether the asylum seeker belongs to one of the categories designated as “persons with special needs,” which includes unaccompanied minors among other categories such as persons with disabilities, pregnant women, persons who have suffered severe psychological, physical, or sexual violence, etc.24 In cases where the physical development of the asylum seeker appears to be incongruous with the declared age at registration and the asylum  17 Id. art. 84. 18 Id. art. 4. 19 Geçici Koruma Yönetmeliği (RTP), O.G.

The Ministry of Family and Social Services and Field Offices, The General Directorate of Child Services, and Childcare Institutions  Once the PDMM determines that the asylum seeker is an UFM (at the outset or after the age determination process), the PDMM will complete the initial registration procedures including issuing the UFM a foreigner identification number or a temporary protection identification card if the minor is eligible for temporary protection. The PDMM must then immediately refer the UFM to the appropriate provincial field office of the Ministry of Family and Social Services (i.e. a Provincial Directorate of Family and Social Services (PDFS)).27 Before the UFM is handed over to the PDFS, the PDMM must ensure that the UFM is examined in a health institution for diseases or substance addiction and necessary treatments are carried out. In addition, the PDMM must obtain from the health institution a report finding that residing in a collective living environment would not pose a health hazard to the UFM.28  Once the UFM is handed over to the appropriate PDFS, the Ministry of Family and Social Services is responsible for the placement of the UFM in a care environment, which is done by one of the following according to the child’s needs: placement with adult relatives, placement with a foster family, or admittance in a childcare institution.29 Public childcare institutions in Turkey are operated by the General Directorate of Child Services, which also supervises related services provided by the non-governmental sector.30 If the UFM is processed under one of the international protection categories (i.e. convention refugee, conditional refugee, or subsidiary protection), the refugee status determination process shall continue before the PMM and its provincial organization until a final decision is rendered (if the UFM is processed under the temporary protection category, the status determination is made at the initial registration). After a positive status determination is made (or temporary protection is granted), the PMM remains the administrative agency responsible for all transactions and processes related to the continuation and termination of the asylum status of the UFM, the UFM’s removal, voluntary return or final resettlement in a third country, and for coordinating with the Ministry of Family and Social Services and other related agencies in the provision of public services such as education and health services.     25 RFIP, supra note 9, art. 123(1)(b); Refakatsiz Çocuklar Yönergesi (UMD), Directive of October 20, 2015, art. 6(1)(c), https://perma.cc/VL77-6BEL (in Turkish). 26 RFIP, supra note 9,  art. 123(1)(ç); UMD, supra note 25, art. 6(1)(ç). 27 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 66(1)(b); RFIP, supra note 9, art. 123(1)(a); UMD, supra note 25, art. 6(1)(e). 28 UMD, supra note 25, art. 6(1)(e), (f). 29 RFIP, supra note 9, art. 123(1)(a); UMD, supra note 25, art. 6(1)(g).  30 Sosyal Hizmetler Kanunu [Law on Social Services], Law No. 2828, O.G.

Courts  Final decisions of all administrative authorities, including the PMM’s decisions regarding admissibility of asylum applications, administrative detention orders, refugee status determinations, and removal decisions are reviewable in administrative courts after available administrative remedies are exhausted.31  The Turkish Civil Code (TCC) requires any minor who is not in the legal custody of a parent to be placed under guardianship.32 This applies also to children who are placed in childcare institutions. Civil judgeships of the peace have jurisdiction to appoint guardians to minors with civil courts of first instance having power to review the decisions made by a guardian on behalf of a minor.33  The LFIP provides that the Law on Protection of Children (LPC) applies to all proceedings under the LFIP concerning UFMs from the moment of initial registration.34 The LPC establishes specialized “children’s courts,” which have jurisdiction to issue child protection orders and to adjudicate all criminal matters involving minors under 18 years of age, regardless of whether they have been emancipated prior to the age of majority.35  C. Legislative framework  • The main legislation governing the processing of asylum applications is the Law on Foreigners and International Protection (LFIP). LFIP mandates immigration authorities to hand over asylum seekers determined to be UFMs to the Ministry of Family and Social Services for purposes of sheltering and eventual protective placement with a childcare institution or responsible adults.  • The procedure applicable to UFMs is further detailed in the LFIP’s implementing regulation, the Regulation on the Implementation of the Law on Foreigners and International Protection (LFIP). • The Regulation on Temporary Protection (RTP) includes some additional provisions regarding the processing of UFMs that are subject to the temporary protection regime rather than international protection.  • The Unaccompanied Minors Directive (UMD),36 issued by the General Directorate of Children Services of the now Ministry of Family and Social Services on October 20, 2015, provides in detail the procedure by which PDMMs shall process the asylum applications of  31 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 80. 32 Türk Medeni Kanunu (TCC), Law No. 4721, O.G.

The Circular requires immigration authorities to enter the asylum seeker’s UFM status at initial temporary protection registration if applicable.  • The Law on Social Services38 and the Regulation on the Planning of Child Protection Services and the Procedure and Principle Governing the Operation of Childcare Institutions (RPCS)39 governs the operation of childcare institutions to which UFMs may be placed following their initial registration in accordance with the relevant provisions of LFIP, RLFIP, and UMD. • The Law on Protection of Children (LPC) lays out general principles concerning the treatment of minors in all administrative and judicial proceedings and provides for child protection and support measures that can be taken by the related administrative and judicial bodies in coordination with the General Directorate of Child Services under the Ministry of Family and Social Services. The LPC also establishes ‘children’s prosecutorial bureaus’ which are prosecutorial bodies with authority to request courts to grant protective orders with regards to minors and to prosecute minor offenders, and ‘children’s courts’ which are trial courts that have jurisdiction to issue protective orders and to adjudicate criminal cases involving minors. The LFIP provides that the Law on Protection of Children (LPC) applies to all proceedings under the LFIP concerning UFMs from the moment of initial registration.40  II. Defining Unaccompanied Minors  For the purposes of the Turkish international protection and temporary protection framework, “unaccompanied minor” is defined as “a child who arrives in Turkey without being accompanied by an adult who by law or custom is responsible for him or her, or, a child left unaccompanied after entry into Turkey, provided that he or she did not subsequently come under the active care of a responsible adult.”41     37 See Circular No. 2017/10, supra note 24. 38 See Law on Social Services, supra note 30.  39 Çocuk Koruma Hizmetleri Planlama ve Çocuk Bakım Kuruluşlarının Çalışma Usul ve Esasları Hakkında Yönetmelik (RPCS), O.G.

Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  The restrictions on claiming asylum under the Turkish international protection and temporary protection framework appear in three categories: grounds for exclusion from international protection, inadmissibility grounds for international protection applications, and grounds for exclusion from temporary protection.42 These grounds are generally applicable and no exceptions are provided in the law for UFMs.  According to article 64 of the LFIP, the following are the grounds on which an applicant may be excluded from international protection:   • the applicant is covered by the language of article 1(D) paragraph 1, (E), and (F) of the United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees as amended by the 1967 Protocol; • there are “reasons to believe that the applicant committed cruel acts outside Turkey, regardless of the motive, before applying for international protection;” • there are serious indications that the applicant poses a danger to public order or public security; or • the applicant has previously committed a crime that is not covered by article 1(F) of the Convention on the Status of Refugees but which, if committed in Turkey, would entail imprisonment, and the applicant has left his or her country of origin or residence only to avoid serving the punishment.  Where an application of the asylum seeker is processed under the international protection category, the PDMM may decide that the asylum seeker’s application is inadmissible. The PDMM must assess the admissibility of the application in the initial registration phase, but an application may be held to be inadmissible at any stage in the process during which grounds for inadmissibility are detected.43 Article 72 of LFIP provides the following grounds on which an application may be found to be inadmissible:  (a) subsequent applications that do not put forward a different reason; (b) applications submitted by persons who were processed previously as family members and have signed a waiver relinquishing the right to make a personal application where the application of such person is (i) made during the pendency of the original application without a justifying reason or (ii) made after the original application was rejected, without providing any additional reasons; (c) applications made by persons who are determined to have come from a country where they have been already recognized as a refugee or where it is determined that the asylum seeker had an opportunity to benefit from sufficient and effective protection including the principle of non-refoulement; and (ç) applications of asylum seekers who have come from a safe third country where he or she has or could have made an application for international protection that would result  42 The RTP does not make a distinction between grounds for exclusion and inadmissibility for temporary protection because the limited geographical scope of temporary protection and the fact that an additional refugee status determination is not required for the granting of temporary protection make the “inadmissibility” grounds that exist for international protection irrelevant for temporary protection.  43 RFIP, supra note 9, arts. 73-74. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 145 in protection conforming to the standards of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol.44 The restrictions on temporary protection are slightly different than those on the granting of international protection. Article 8 of the RTP provides for a list of persons ineligible for temporary protection, or whose temporary protection status must be cancelled if discovered after registration. These are the following: a) Those with respect to whom there are serious reasons to consider that they are guilty ofactions defined in Article 1 (F) of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees dated28/7/1951 amended by the 1967 Protocol Relating to the Status of Refugees;b) Those regarding whom there are reasons indicating that he or she has committed cruelacts outside of Turkey for any reason whatsoever;c) He or she has taken part in the commission of crimes or acts as specified insubparagraphs (a) and (b) of this paragraph or incited others to commit such crimes or acts;ç) Those who took part in armed conflicts in his or her country and did not permanentlycease such activities;d) Those who are identified as having committed, planned to commit, or participated inacts of terrorism;e) Those who are considered to be a threat to the public due to being convicted of a seriouscrime and those who are considered to pose danger to national security, public order, orpublic security;f) Those who have previously committed a crime or crimes for which an imprisonmentsentence would have been given if committed in Turkey and have left their country oforigin or country of residence in order to avoid punishment for that crime;g) Those who are convicted of crimes against humanity by international courts;ğ) Those who have committed one of the crimes laid down in Chapter Seven of Part  Four of the Turkish Penal Code No. 5237 of 26/9/2004 [i.e. Crimes against state secrets and espionage].45 While the general restrictions on international protection or temporary protection applications apply to UFMs without exception, UFMs are exempt from the “accelerated assessment” procedure for denying international protection applications that are prima facie inadmissible or are suspect for certain reasons.46 UFMs are thus spared from summary denial of their applications under this procedure.  44 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 72. 45 RTP, supra note 19, art. 8. 46 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 79. Applications are subject to the accelerated assessment process in cases where the applicant, (a) has never mentioned elements that would require international protection when presenting reasons while lodging the application; (b) misled the authorities by presenting untrue or misguiding information or documents or, by withholding information or documents that might negatively impact the decision; (c) has destroyed or disposed of identity or travel documents in bad faith in order to make determination of identity or citizenship difficult; (ç) has been placed under administrative detention pending removal; (d) has applied solely to postpone or prevent the implementation of a decision that would lead to his/her removal from Turkey; (e) poses a public order or public security threat or, has previously been removed from Turkey on such grounds; (f) repeats the application after the [initial] application is considered to have been withdrawn. Id. The assessment interview for such applications must take place within three days of \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 146 IV. Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A. Visas  In Turkish immigration law, UFMs are not eligible for, or subject to, a special visa regime outside of the international protection or temporary protection systems. UFMs who have entered Turkey regularly or irregularly are subject to the same general rules regarding the conditions to remain in the country and the issuance of short- and long-term residence permits, applicable to other foreigners.47   B. Legal Representation  The international protection and temporary protection framework do not provide for a general right to counsel in the administrative proceedings related to asylum; neither does a general right to counsel exist in the procedure before administrative courts in cases of judicial review of the administration’s decisions. Generally, applicants for international protection may be represented by counsel at their own expense in administrative proceedings other than the initial application and the refugee status determination interview, to which the applicant’s attorney may attend as an observer.48 Applicants for international protection have may be represented by counsel at their own expense in all administrative proceedings.49 As a matter of course, the applicants may be represented by counsel in judicial proceedings before administrative courts at their own expense.50  Nevertheless, the procedure under the LFIP ensures that the UFM will have some civil representation, at least once the UFM is transferred to the care of the General Directorate of Child Services. The RPCS provides that the childcare institutions in which a minor is placed must immediately initiate the necessary legal procedures for the appointment of a guardian for the  the initial registration, and decisions on the applications must be finalized within five days of the interview. LFIP art. 79(2). 47 A country report published by the European Council of Refugees and Exiles (ECRE) reports on the basis of anecdotal evidence that UMs accommodated in childcare institutions have been at occasions granted Turkish citizenship if it was established that they have no relatives in Turkey.

Role of Child Protection Agencies  Once the UFM is handed over to the appropriate PDFS by the PDMM that has completed the UFM’s initial registration and (if necessary) age determination, the Ministry of Family and Social Services will place the UFM with adult relatives, with a foster family, or in a childcare institution.59 The Unaccompanied Minors Directive of 2015 governs the role of the Ministry and the relevant PDFS after the child is transferred to their care. The Directive provides that the placement of the UFM with a foster family, if possible with a family of same nationality, should be given preference over placement in a childcare institution, if this is in line with the best interest of the UFM and the UFM’s own wishes.60 UFMs, to the extent possible and considering the age and maturity of the UFMs, must not be separated from their siblings, and their location of placement must not be changed unless necessary.61    51 RPCS, supra note 39, art. 36(1). 52 TCC, supra note 32, art. 404. 53 Id. art. 413. 54 Id. art. 448. 55 Id. art. 457. 56 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 66. 57 LCP, supra note 34, arts. 5, 6. 58 See id. art. 4. 59 RFIP, supra note 9, art. 123(1)(a); UMD, supra note 25, art. 6(1)(g).  60 UMD, supra note 25, art. 5. 61 Id. art. 6(h). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 148 UFMs who are not placed with a family are to be admitted in one of the various types of childcare institutions that is appropriate in light of their age, sex, and personal condition.62 UFMs who suffer from mental or physical disabilities, chronic illnesses, or psychological disorders and UFMs who are considered youthful offenders under the LPC must be placed in appropriate social services institutions.63  For UFMs to be placed in childcare facilities, the authorities must obtain from the children’s courts the requisite child protection orders for care in institutions.64 UFMs must be appointed a counselor by the childcare institution, who shall inform the UFM of the services that the institution shall provide and orient the UFM to life in the institution.65   The Ministry must ensure that school-age UFMs placed in childcare institutions are enrolled in appropriate primary or secondary schools, and for those who are older, appropriate placements in extended study programs or occupational schools are made available, if possible.66 The UFMs must also be provided with free Turkish language courses.67 Health costs of the UFMs who are placed in childcare institutions are covered by the national mandatory general health insurance system.68    The UFM’s appointed counselor must accompany the UFM in the refugee status determination interview, and the views of the UFM’s counselor must be considered in the preparation of the interview report.69 A copy of the interview report must be sent to the relevant PDFS for inclusion in the UFM’s file.70 The Ministry must communicate with the relevant PDMM to monitor the status of the UFM’s application for international protection, and communicate to asylum authorities any request by the UFM for family reunification in the origin country, third country, or voluntary return.71   62 Id. art. 7(1)(a).  63 Id. art. 8(6). 64 Id. art. 10(1)(a). 65 Id. art. 10(1)(d)-(g). 66 Id. art. 10(1)(ı), (i). 67 Id. art. 10(1)(j). 68 Id. art. 10(1)(ç). 69 Id. art. 6(ı), (i). 70 Id. art. 6(i). 71 Id. art. 10(k), (l), and (n).  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 149 V.

Detention  UFMs are categorically excluded from the administrative immigration detention measures provided under the LFIP.72 As explained above, the special provisions of the LFIP and RFIP require the referral of the UFM to the PDFS which will proceed with accommodating UFMs in an appropriate care environment for the entire duration of their asylum process (including eventual removal, if status is denied), or until they reach majority.  UFMs who are accommodated in childcare institutions must be offered appropriate educational, health, and socialization services.73  B. Repatriation  Like all other asylum seekers, UFMs who seek asylum benefit from the non-refoulment principle enshrined in the LFIP.74 UFMs are not subject to a special repatriation regime and are removable on ordinary grounds upon denial or termination of status. UFMs for whom a final removal decision order has been rendered, however, may not be placed in removal detention in removal centers unless they are at least 16 years old and special accommodations are provided.75 Rules on voluntary return are equally applicable to UFMs. Nevertheless, as in all other administrative processes involving UFMs, the LFIP requires the administration to take into account the best interest of the child in the removal or voluntary removal procedure.76   VI. Resettlement and Integration Programs  A. Resettlement   Resettlement of persons under international protection is managed by the PMM in coordination with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR). Resettlement of Syrian nationals under temporary protection is mainly carried out through two programs; the regular UNHCR resettlement program and the “one-to-one” resettlement program that was established between the European Union and Turkey following the EU-Turkey statement of March 18, 2016, and under which the European Union committed to receive one Syrian under temporary protection for resettlement in an EU country for every Syrian asylum seeker returned to Turkey from Greece. The PMM is responsible for identifying candidates for resettlement and referring  72 See Part I(B) and IV(C) supra; see also ECRE, supra note 47, at 120.  73 See generally UMD, supra note 25, art. 10.  74 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 4. 75 RFIP, supra note 9, art. 123(2)(d). 76 LFIP, supra note 8, art. 66(1)(a). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 150 them to UNHCR and the relevant EU bodies as applicants for resettlement.77 Final decisions are made by the third countries.78   According to PMM data, between 2014 and April 2023, 21,147 Syrians under temporary protection were resettled in third countries through the UNHCR program or directly, the majority of these being resettled in Canada (10,998), USA (4,791), UK (2,681), and Norway (1,931).79 An additional 37,347 were settled in EU member states under the “one-to-one” scheme in the same time period, the main countries of resettlement being Germany (15,390), France (5,745), Netherlands (5,520), Sweden (3,152), and Finland (2,742).80   The PMM does not publish statistics on the number of persons under international protection who were resettled, although resettlement remains the ultimate objective of the “conditional refugee” status under the LFIP. UNHCR’s Turkey office regularly publishes statistics which sometimes include the year-to-date number of resettlement applications that it has processed. These statistics include resettlement applications made by conditional refugees or applicants for conditional refugee status in addition to Syrians under temporary protection. For example, according to a July 2022 “operational update,” the UNHCR processed resettlement applications from 10,584 applicants between the beginning of 2022 and July 31, 2022 and 5,144 persons left the country in the same period to be resettled in one of 14 third countries.81 These statistics also do not provide the breakdown of the numbers between different asylum statutes, other than stating that 8% of the 5,144 persons were Afghan nationals (and thus most probably conditional refugees).82  There are no specific rules in the asylum law framework regarding the resettlement of UFMs. UFMs are thus subject to the general rules applicable to persons with the same asylum status. We found no substantive information regarding the factors that the PMM give weight to when determining candidates for resettlement, and how the fact that a person was registered as an UFM factors into the determination.   B. Integration   The Turkish asylum law framework does not specifically envisage the eventual settlement of the asylum status holders in Turkey.83 Indeed, the conditional refugee and temporary protection categories are expressly designed to provide short-term protection with the eventual return of  77 See ECRE, supra note 47, at 175. 78 Id. 79 Up-to-Date Statistics – Temporary Protection, Presidency of Migration Management, https://perma.cc/NCA7-PNJA. 80 Id. 81 UNHCR, Operational Update May-June 2022: Türkiye, https://perma.cc/4S3S-EAEL. 82 Id. 83 See e.g. LFIP, supra note 8, art. 42(2) (providing that convention refugees, conditional refugees, persons under subsidiary protection, and persons under temporary protection are ineligible to apply for long-term residence permits). \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 151 asylum status holders to a third country (for conditional refugees) or to their country of origin (for persons under temporary protection) being the final objective. In particular, the LFIP expressly states that conditional refugees are allowed to stay in the country “until resettled in a third country.”84  Likewise, the temporary protection framework provides for only a temporary regime to manage mass movements caused by crises that take place in countries of origin that are limited in time, such as war or national disasters, and envisages a presidential determination declaring that the end of the relevant crisis, which may terminate the protection status of all status holders en masse with the expectation that it is now safe for the whole guest population to return to the country of origin.85   Nevertheless, the LFIP and RFIP empower the PMM to establish “[social] cohesion” programs for asylum seekers and status holders.86 The cohesion scheme appears to consist of a patchwork of programs implemented by various government agencies and funded by different sources including the European Union, the World Bank, various funding streams coordinated by the United Nations Regional Refugee & Resilience (3RP) Plan, and the central government budget.87   Programs ensuring the access to education of children under international or temporary protection and Turkish language courses appear to be the cohesion schemes most relevant to UFMs. Article 42 of the Constitution of Turkey provides that “no one shall be deprived of the right of education.”88 Formal basic education is mandatory by law for all children between the ages 6 and 14, and is provided in public schools for free.89 In accordance with this constitutional and legal mandate, school-age children who are subject to the international protection or temporary protection regimes are eligible to enroll in Turkish-language public schools after their competence level is determined by an equivalence assessment conducted by the Ministry of National Education.90 While the legal framework does not distinguish between children subject to the international protection regime and those subject to the temporary protection regime with relation to access to basic education, the services actually available to these populations appear to vary due to the different sources of funding, with apparently more international funding being made available for the Syrian population under temporary protection.   84 Id. art. 62. 85 See RTP, supra note 19, arts. 1, 11, and 14. However, upon terminating the temporary protection regime, the president of the republic has the authority to (a) fully suspend the temporary protection and to return persons benefiting from temporary protection to their countries; (b) collectively grant on persons benefiting from temporary protection an [international protection] status provided that they satisfy the conditions of such status, or to assess the applications of those who applied for international protection on an individual basis; or (c) allow persons benefiting from temporary protection to stay in Turkey subject to conditions to be determined within the scope of the Law.

The ALP was initiated in provinces where Syrian children (of which more than 1.7 million are under temporary protection in Turkey) were concentrated and includes reinforcement courses in basic reading, writing and numeracy skills, and intensive Turkish language courses aimed at achieving educational equivalency sufficient for the children to enter/reenter regular or extended first or secondary education.91 The ALP is a collaboration between the Ministry of National Education, The Ministry of Youth and Sports, the Turkish Red Crescent, and UNICEF, and is partially funded by the European Union.92 An equivalent program is not found for children under international protection, however that population is reported to have access to Turkish language courses offered by the Turkish Red Crescent across the country, and may still benefit from EBA TV, which the Ministry of National Education’s distance education service that is made available to the public on the state TV channels and on the internet.93   Public childcare institutions in which UFMs are placed are required by directive to ensure the children’s enrolment and attendance in the formal education system and Turkish language classes.94   VII. Family Reunification  While the LFIP and RFIP provides that holders of “refugee” and “subsidiary protection” status are eligible for making a family reunification application for their qualified relatives, holders or applicants of “conditional refugee” status (which applies to nearly all asylum seekers or asylum status holders in Turkey who are subject to the temporary protection regime) are specifically excluded from eligibility, with no exceptions made for UFMs who are subject to the “conditional refugee” status.95   On the other hand, under the RTP, persons who are under temporary protection (comprising the vast majority of asylum status holders in Turkey) have a right to apply for family reunification in Turkey on behalf of their qualified relatives.96 The RTP requires that the family reunification requests of UFMs under temporary protection must be processed immediately upon receipt.97 According to ECRE, the Turkish Red Crescent (Türk Kızılay) and the Presidency of Disaster and Emergency Management under the Ministry of Internal Affairs are the main agencies that work on family tracking and family reunifications.98 The Turkish Red Crescent reported that as of  91 See UNICEF, Yaygın Eğitim Programı (date unknown), https://perma.cc/UM99-TN9Y (in Turkish); ECRE, supra note 47, at 187. 92 UNICEF, supra note 90. 93 ECRE, supra note 47, at 98-99. 94 UMD, supra note 25, art. 10(ı)-(j).  95 See LFIP, supra note 8, art. 34(1). 96 RTP, supra note 19, art. 49. 97 Id. 98 ECRE, supra note 47, at 173. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 153 October 2022 they processed 4002 cases of family reunification 3939 cases of family tracking.99 Disaggregated numbers for UFMs are not provided.         99 Turkish Red Crescent, Migration Services Directorate Monthly Report: October 2022 44 (November 2022), https://perma.cc/4H5U-2MFY.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 154 United Kingdom  Clare Feikert-Ahalt Senior Foreign Law Specialist    SUMMARY The laws that govern both immigration and the care of unaccompanied minors in the United Kingdom (UK) are complex and contained in a number of different statutes, secondary legislation, and the common law. There is an overarching principle that all decisions involving children must be taken with regard to safeguarding and promoting their well-being.    The government currently spends around 3 billion pounds (approximately US$3.77 billion) a year on the asylum system. There has recently been a significant increase in the arrival of unaccompanied minors in the UK by small boat, and the government notes the majority are aged 16 and 17 years. Where the age of the individual is unclear, an age assessment is performed. The government reported in 2022 that half of those who underwent this assessment were found to be adults.   Unaccompanied minors, considered to be those under the age of 18 who are not with any family members, may make an application for asylum on their own behalf, and are typically put into the care of local authorities while these applications are being considered. Local authorities must treat them in the same manner as other “cared for” children in their area. This includes the provision of health services and education.    Due to the overarching principle of safeguarding and promoting the well-being of minors, a new immigration category, known as unaccompanied asylum-seeking child leave, was created for unaccompanied minors whose applications for asylum are refused and who are not eligible for any other forms of protection or leave, but who cannot be removed to their country of origin due to a lack of adequate reception facilities. This leave is temporary and allows the unaccompanied minors to stay in the UK until they turn 18 and there is no longer a requirement for adequate reception facilities in their country of return.    While unaccompanied minors may be detained for up to 24 hours, guidance from the government states detention is typically not used. Due to an increase in arrivals of unaccompanied minors, many are being housed in hotels while awaiting transfer to a local authority, which has caused concern, and a number of minors have been reported as missing.    Unaccompanied minors are entitled to a free legal representative, who helps them complete forms and is present during a substantive interview where their claim is considered.    Government guidance notes the ultimate aim is the reunification of unaccompanied minors with their families, but the default location for the reunions is not the UK. There is no specific provision in the Immigration Rules for the reunion of unaccompanied minors with their families in the UK, as the government does not want to create an \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 155 incentive for families to send their children unaccompanied to the UK in the hopes of being reunited and settling there. Nevertheless, the authorities have discretion to do so.   The government has recently introduced a bill that, if enacted, will provide that any asylum or human rights claims from unaccompanied minors who enter the UK illegally as well as those who travel through safe third countries will be declared inadmissible, and they will be removed and not be permitted to settle in the UK. The secretary of state will also be able to introduce regulations on the amount of time an unaccompanied minor may be detained.   I.  Introduction  The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK), consisting of England, Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland, has recently undergone a period of devolution with the creation of a Scottish Parliament, a Welsh Assembly, and a Northern Ireland Assembly (currently suspended) that can legislate in certain areas. Citizenship and nationality are not devolved areas, however, and thus remain the responsibility of the UK Parliament.1 The secretary of state for the Home Department (a member of the British executive branch) and the department, commonly referred to as the Home Office, have responsibility for almost all matters relating to immigration, including asylum, nationality, and border control laws.  Since 1891, the common law of the UK has provided that “no alien has any right to enter this country except by leave of the Crown.”2 The Aliens Restriction Act 1914,3 the Aliens Restriction (Amending) Act 1919,4 and the rules and orders made under these acts gave the common law rule a statutory basis and formed the restrictions on immigration.  A.  Statistics   The UK receives a large number of applications for asylum seekers each year and spends around 3 billion pounds (approximately US$3.77 billion) a year on the asylum system.5 Applications for  1 “Nationality” refers to the status of those individuals who are British citizens, British subjects with the right of abode in the United Kingdom and who are thus outside the scope of the United Kingdom’s immigration control, and citizens of British Overseas Territories. In this report, the term “citizenship” is used to include nationality. These terms are commonly interchanged. Nationality has been defined as a person’s international identity that demonstrates they belong to a state, as evidenced by a passport. Citizenship has been considered to be more “a matter of law determined by the facts of a person’s date and place of birth, those of their parents and the application of the provisions of the relevant legislation,” and is concerned with the rights, duties, and opportunities that a person has within a state, such as voting rights, military service, and access to healthcare.

In contrast, across the member states of the European Union (EU) the average is 14 asylum applications for every 10,000 people. The UK ranked 16th across the EU plus UK for asylum applications per person.10 In 2022, the refusal rate of applications at the initial decision was 24%. This is the lowest refusal rate since 1990, significantly down from the 88% refusal rate in 2004.11   There have been shifts in the countries from which applicants arrive. In 2021, 42% of applicants were nationals of Middle Eastern countries, and 23% were nationals of African countries. In 2022, 31% of applicants were from Asian countries; 24% of applicants were from European countries; 23% of applicants were from Middle Eastern countries, and 17% were from African countries.12   B.  Jurisdictional Responsibilities  1.  Home Office   The Home Office is the government department with primary responsibility for almost all aspects of immigration, including asylum, nationality, and border control laws. Various directorates within the Home Office handle specific items relating to these areas of responsibility.13  UK Visas and Immigration, acting on behalf of the home secretary and minister for immigration, is responsible for processing asylum applications.14 The Border Force is responsible for immigration and customs controls at UK ports and airports.15 Immigration Enforcement ensures that immigration laws are complied with, such as the prohibition on working without proper  6 Georgina Sturge, HC Libr., SN01403, Asylum Statistics 11 (Mar. 1, 2023), https://perma.cc/ASW4-MRPN.  7 Gov.uk, National Statistics, How Many People Do We Grant Protection to?

Local Authorities  Local authorities across Great Britain, and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland, have a legal duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need and provide “services appropriate to those children’s needs.”17 Under section 20 of the Children Act 1989, unaccompanied minors are considered to be “looked after” children,18 and local authorities have a duty to provide accommodation to them. A care plan must also be put in place to provide for the services that are needed “to achieve or maintain a reasonable standard of health or development”19 for unaccompanied minors. To ensure that unaccompanied minors are not placed in a few local authorities near ports of arrival, the National Transfer Scheme (NTS) was established. The NTS provides that unaccompanied minors may be transferred from one local authority to another. A local authority requesting the transfer of an unaccompanied minor must care for unaccompanied minors who meet or exceed 0.1% of the general child population of that authority, and the local authority to which the child is being transferred must not meet that threshold.20   3.  Refugee Council Panel of Advisers  All unaccompanied children who arrive in the UK must be referred to the Refugee Council Panel of Advisers, also known as the Children’s Panel, within 24 hours of the minors’ first encounter with a government worker, who is typically an immigration officer. The Refugee Council Panel of Advisers is responsible for assisting and advising unaccompanied children through the asylum process and helping them with interactions with the Home Office and other government agencies, such as local authorities. The Refugee Council Panel of Advisers does not provide legal advice, but can act in the role of a responsible adult.21  16 About Us—Immigration Enforcement, Gov.uk, https://perma.cc/7UKV-H83B.  17 Children Act 1989, c. 41, § 17, https://perma.cc/NV9L-YLFD.

Legislative Framework  1.  International Agreements   The legal framework that governs how asylum claims from unaccompanied minors are processed includes both international agreements and national legislation. The UK is a signatory of the following international agreements:  • the 1951 United Nations Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and the 1967 Protocol (the Refugee Convention),24 which are the main sources for laws governing international protection, • the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child,25 and • the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR),26 as implemented into the domestic laws of the UK by the Human Rights Act 1998,27 which requires public authorities to act in a manner that is compatible with the ECHR.  2.  National Laws  The Immigration Act 1971,28 and the Immigration Rules made under it,29 contain the primary statutory regime governing immigration in the UK. The Immigration Rules are a fluid set of rules that change frequently.30 The law requires individuals who are not British or Commonwealth  22 Support for Separated Children and Young People, Scottish Guardianship Serv., https://perma.cc/55HJ-Y9LD.

The Immigration Rules   The Immigration Rules state that minors can make a claim for protection “in their own right,”35 and that this should be made at the earliest opportunity. Failing to do so without a reasonable explanation is taken into account and can damage the credibility of a subsequent application.36 The Immigration Rules provide that “in view of their potential vulnerability, particular priority and care is to be given to the handling of their cases.”37 Unaccompanied minors may qualify for refugee status, humanitarian protection, family or private life leave, discretionary leave, or unaccompanied asylum seeking child (UASC) leave.38  A minor’s application for refugee status must meet the same criteria and standard of proof as that of other individuals seeking asylum. The secretary of state must be satisfied that  (i) they are in the United Kingdom or have arrived at a port of entry in the United Kingdom; and  (ii) they are a refugee, as defined in Article 1 of the 1951 Refugee Convention; and  (iii) there are no reasonable grounds for regarding them as a danger to the security of the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention; and  (iv) having been convicted by a final judgment of a particularly serious crime, they do not constitute a danger to the community of the United Kingdom in accordance with Article 33(2) of the Refugee Convention as defined in Section 72 of the Nationality Immigration and Asylum Act 2002; and  (v) refusing their application would result in them being required to go (whether immediately or after the time limited by any existing leave to enter or remain in the UK) in breach of the Refugee Convention, to a country in which they would be persecuted on account of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion or membership of a particular social group.39    31 The European Economic Area consists of the Members of the European Union plus Norway, Iceland, and Liechtenstein.

An asylum application made on behalf of a child should not be refused solely because the child is too young to understand their situation or to have formed a well founded fear of persecution. Close attention should be given to the welfare of the child at all times.40  When assessing the credibility of a claim, Home Office staff   must [on a case-by-case basis] demonstrate as part of the decision making process consideration of any distinct factors taken into account during the assessment of credibility in a child’s claim . . . including:  • the child’s age and maturity at the time of the event and at the time of the interview  • mental or emotional trauma experienced by the child  • educational level  • fear or mistrust of authorities  • feelings of shame • painful memories, particularly those of a sexual nature.41  4.  Safeguarding and Promoting the Welfare of Children  Section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009 places a duty on the secretary of state to make arrangements to ensure that its immigration functions are “discharged having regard to the need to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in the United Kingdom.”42 Statutory guidance to this provision defines the term safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children as  • protecting children from maltreatment;  • preventing impairment of children’s health or development (where health means ‘physical or mental health’ and development means ‘physical, intellectual, emotional, social or behavioural development’); • ensuring that children are growing up in circumstances consistent with the provision of safe and effective care; and  • undertaking that role so as to enable those children to have optimum life chances and to enter adulthood successfully.43   40 Id. pt. 11, ¶ 351. 41 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 53. 42 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, c. 11, § 55, https://perma.cc/E726-DLMW.

During the asylum process, staff and decision makers who handle children must consider whether the children are: safe during their time in the UK, being dealt with in an age-sensitive and child-friendly manner reflecting their maturity and vulnerability, having their best interests taken into account when decisions are made about them, having their physical and medical needs addressed, having their age and maturity taken into account, experiencing mental or emotional trauma from past events, and having their right to preserve their identity protected.49  To help ensure that that any decisions affecting a child, or any services provided under arrangements made by the secretary of state to conduct these functions are provided with regard to this need, any decisions taken on an application from an unaccompanied minor must be made by a “person who is trained to deal with protection claims from children.”50  5. Granting ProtectionThe Supreme Court has set out six factors that should be considered when making an immigration decision involving the deportation of a parent, and the Home Office has noted “the spirit of which can be applied in the context of an [unaccompanied minor].”51 The factors are: •is it reasonable to expect the child to live in another country?•what is the level of the child’s integration into this country?•how long has the child been away from the country of the parents?•where and with whom will the child live if compelled to live overseas?•what will the arrangements be for the child in that other country?44 UK Visas & Immigr., Transition at Age 18 Instruction (ver. 4), https://perma.cc/4XDS-GJSW. 45 Gov.uk, Guidance: Certification of Protection and Human Rights Claims Under Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Clearly Unfounded Claims) (Accessible) (last updated Apr. 18, 2023), https://perma.cc/Q2AP-GUY2. 46 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 67.

Other Types of Protection  If unaccompanied minors’ claims for refugee status are refused, they may qualify for a grant of humanitarian protection if they “would face a real risk of suffering serious harm and [are] unable, or, owing to such risk, unwilling to avail themselves of the protection of that country.”54  In cases where an unaccompanied minor is refused both asylum and humanitarian protection, it must be determined whether “there are safe, adequate and sustainable reception arrangements in the child’s home country” (discussed in Part III.B, below).55 If there are, the application from the unaccompanied minor may be refused. If adequate and sustainable reception arrangements are not in place, “and there is no current prospect of them being made, and but for this it would be reasonable for the child to return,”56 the unaccompanied minor cannot be lawfully returned to their country of origin and they may be granted limited leave to remain as a UASC under the Immigration Rules.57 In order to be granted this leave, the following criteria must be met:  • The applicant must be an unaccompanied minor seeking asylum who is under 17.5 years of age throughout the duration of the leave granted in this capacity, • the applicant must have applied for asylum and been granted neither refugee status nor humanitarian protection, • there must be no adequate reception arrangements in the country to which they would be returned, • there are no reasonable grounds to consider the applicant a danger to the security of the UK,  • the applicant must not be excluded from being a refugee,58   52 Id. at 66, referring to ZH v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2011] UKSC 4, ¶ 29, https://perma.cc/63JJ-KYR6. 53 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 61. 54 Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 339C.

If, at any time, the applicant meets one or more of the criteria listed above, or has been found to misrepresent or omit facts to obtain leave under these provisions, the leave will cease.61 This leave is not qualifying leave towards settlement protection indefinite leave to remain.62 Once unaccompanied minors reach 17.5 years of age, they will be considered for return, and the procedure discussed immediately below will be followed. Section 82 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provides a right of appeal for UASC leave.63  Unaccompanied minors who are older than 17.5 but younger than 18 should be considered for return, taking into account “the commitment that no unaccompanied child will be returned without safe, adequate and sustainable reception arrangements being in place.” If the reception arrangements are considered to be adequate and with the approval of a senior manager, the unaccompanied minor may be removed. In cases where the unaccompanied minor cannot be removed due to concerns over the reception standards in the country of origin, or if there are no return arrangements, the unaccompanied minor is notified that, once they turn 18, they “will be liable for removal”64 unless they qualify for leave to remain on other grounds. This provides the unaccompanied minor and their social worker with six months to prepare the minor for the return to their country of origin.65 At all points during this process, the duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of the minor should be considered, and if the reception conditions at any point fail to meet the standards, the return must be halted with immediate effect.66  Prior to the incorporation of UASC into the immigration rules, discretionary leave outside the rules was used, but guidance from the Home Office notes that discretionary leave may be used if there are compelling reasons that are in the best interests of the child to grant a longer period of leave.67     59 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, c. 41, https://perma.cc/L5C5-8DMZ.  60 Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 352ZC-F. 61 Id. pt. 11, ¶ 352ZE. 62 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 64. 63 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, c. 41, § 82.  64 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 65. 65 Id. at 64. 66 Id. at 65 and the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, c. 11, § 55.  67 Home Off., Discretionary Leave 16 (ver. 10.0, Mar. 16, 2023), https://perma.cc/35M2-P6NB. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 164 7.  Withdrawing Applications  Unaccompanied minors may withdraw their application at any point, and must do so through a representative or responsible adult.68 Applications may also be treated as being withdrawn where a minor does not comply with requests for information, either by failing to submit without a reasonable explanation or submitting the information late. If the minor fails to attend the substantive interview, the claim may be treated as implicitly withdrawn.69 This treatment is not automatic, and efforts must be made to determine why the child did not attend, such as contacting the minor’s legal representative, before a decision to refuse the claim on grounds of noncompliance is made.70 The Refugee Council Panel of Advisers: Children’s Panel must be notified of any decision refusing a claim on these grounds.71  8. The Illegal Migration Bill   Due to a substantial increase in individuals attempting to enter the UK unlawfully via small boats,72 which is inherently dangerous, and concerns over gangs having an incentive to smuggle people into the country, the government introduced the Illegal Migration Bill, which is currently under consideration in the House of Lords.73 The government has stated that the purpose of the bill is to “make it unambiguously clear that, if you enter the UK illegally, you should not be able to remain here. Instead, you will be detained and promptly removed either to your home country or to a safe country where any asylum claim will be considered.”74 Under the current provisions of the bill, individuals entering the UK without lawful permission will be detained and removed to their home country, or if it is not safe for them to be removed there, to a safe third country, such as Rwanda,75 and applications for asylum will be considered from these countries.76   If enacted, the bill would place a duty on the secretary of state to remove individuals who enter the UK without lawful permission from the country as soon as is reasonably practicable.77 It would not require the secretary of state to remove unaccompanied minors until they are 18 years  68 Home Off., Withdrawing Asylum Claims 11 (ver. 6.0, May 7, 2020), https://perma.cc/WY3E-S9KC.  69 Id. at 68. 70 Id.  71 Id.  72 Press Release, Home Off. & Rt.

The bill would provide that any asylum or human rights claims from unaccompanied minors who enter the UK illegally will be declared inadmissible, as well as from those who travel through safe third countries. They would not be permitted to settle in the UK and, once removed, would not be allowed to re-enter.78 While the bill would not require the secretary of state to remove unaccompanied children until they turn 18 years of age, it would empower the secretary of state to reunite them with their parents; to a designated safe country where the person is either a national or has a passport or other identity document.79 The secretary of state would have discretion to introduce regulations specifying other circumstances under which unaccompanied minors could be removed, and for how long they could be detained before their removal.80 During the time unaccompanied minors who entered the country without lawful permission are in the UK before they turn 18 and are removed, the bill provides that, where necessary, the secretary of state would be responsible for providing, or arranging, accommodation and appropriate support for them prior to any transfer to a local authority. Local authorities could also transfer the unaccompanied minors back to the care of the secretary of state. Once removed under the provisions of the bill, the unaccompanied minor would not be allowed to re-enter the UK.  The bill would add Albania, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Norway, and Switzerland to the list of designated countries. The government intention behind the bill is to ensure that individuals in need of asylum will enter through legal routes and avoid dangerous crossings and human trafficking, and it has stated it intends to create more of these routes.81 The bill would also place an annual cap on the number of people who may claim asylum in the UK, although this can be amended “in the face of humanitarian emergencies.”82  The bill has been subject to considerable criticism from human rights groups, which have described it as a ban on asylum and assert it breaches a number of the UK’s international obligations.83 The bill itself includes a statement from a government minister, noting “I am unable to make a statement that, in my view, the provisions of the Illegal Migration Bill are compatible with the Convention rights, but the Government nevertheless wishes the House to proceed with the Bill.”84      78 Id. 79 Illegal Migration Bill, HL Bill 133, cl. 3, supra note 73. 80 Id. cl. 10.

Defining Unaccompanied Minors  The Immigration Rules define the term “minor” as any person under the age of 18,85 and the term “unaccompanied asylum seeking minor” as a person who  a) is under 18 years of age when the asylum application is submitted.  b) is applying for asylum in their own right; and c) is separated from both parents and is not being cared for by an adult who in law or by custom has responsibility to do so.86  Guidance published by the Home Office on child asylum seekers notes that “[b]eing unaccompanied is not necessarily a permanent status and may change, particularly if the child has family members in the UK.”87 The policy notes that an accompanied asylum-seeking child is a person “being cared for either by parents or by someone who in law or custom has responsibility to do so.”88  As noted above, the Immigration Rules state that minors can make a claim for protection “in their own right”89 and that this should be made at the earliest opportunity. Failing to do so without a reasonable explanation is taken into account and may damage the credibility of the application.90   A.  Interview  Upon arrival, minors do not undergo the same screening interview that adult asylum seekers do. Biometric data is taken, other than for minors under the age of five years old,91 and minors undergo a welfare interview, which is distinguished from the screening interview that adults undergo because its sole purpose is to identify any welfare or human trafficking concerns.92 Additionally, any information obtained during this interview “cannot be used to examine the basis of the claim for asylum.”93 Once the welfare interview and form is complete, the unaccompanied minor is referred to the National Asylum Allocation Team, who allocates the care of the child to a local authority.94     85 Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 349.  86 Id. pt. 11, ¶ 352ZD. 87 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 10.  88 Id. 89 Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 349. 90 Id. 91 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 32. 92 AN & FA v.

Age Assessment  “Merton compliant”95 age assessments may be undertaken on unaccompanied minors where the secretary of state, local authority, or other specified public authority does not have sufficient evidence to determine the age of the individual.96 These are conducted to “guard against the detention of children generally, including accidental detention of someone who is believed to be an adult but subsequently found to be a child.”97   Merton compliant age assessments “are holistic assessments, involving detailed background research and analysis of information, and are fundamentally different from the initial age assessments that are carried out when people arrive at the border.”98 A number of factors are used to determine age, including physical appearance and demeanor using the “benefit of the doubt” principle, so when the age is unclear, the individual should be treated as a minor.99 The standard of proof used for an age assessment is the balance of probabilities,100 and the results of any age assessment is binding on the secretary of state and local authorities, unless new information is provided after the age assessment has been undertaken.101  Legislation was recently introduced to enable the secretary of state, after obtaining scientific advice about appropriate methods,102 to make regulations specifying the scientific methods to be used for age assessments. These methods can include the measurement of body parts and the analysis of samples, such as DNA, taken from a person.103 Regulations have yet to be made under this section. Additionally, the secretary of state recently established the National Age Assessment  95 B v London Borough of Merton [2003] EWHC 1689 (Admin) (Commonly referred to as “Merton”), https://perma.cc/4R6Y-EL6A. This case sets out a number of principles that should be followed when determining the age of an unaccompanied minor.

The right of appeal is to the first-tier tribunal, which must determine the individuals’ ages on the balance of probabilities and assign them dates of birth.106  C.  Substantive Interview  The Immigration Rules require all children over the age of 12 who have claimed asylum to undergo an interview “about the substance of their protection claim unless the child is determined to be unfit or unable to be interviewed, or meets one of the other exceptions contained in paragraph 339NA.”107 An unaccompanied minor may request that the interviewer be of a specific gender and communicate through the minor’s preferred communication method or language.108 The interview may be conducted through video conference.109 Interviews must be conducted with a guardian, representative, or adult who must be independent from the secretary of state and responsible for the child. The interviewer must have undergone specialist training in how to interview children and “have particular regard to the possibility that a child will feel inhibited or alarmed.”110  Interpreters are provided by the Home Office for each stage of the asylum process for minors who cannot speak English. The interpreters are required to “provide an impartial interpretation of the claimant’s account”111 and must follow the Interpreters Code of Conduct.112 The interpreter must interpret questions verbatim and “ensure adequate and appropriate interpretation of child-friendly and age-appropriate language is being used.”113  The interview may be suspended if the child appears tired or distressed and, at all stages, the duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of the child must be taken into account.114 Guidance  104 Home Off., National Age Assessment Board: The National Age Assessment Board and Sections 50 and 51 of the Nationality and Borders Act 2022 (ver. 1.0, Mar. 31, 2023), https://perma.cc/MTM2-QSG8.  105 New Board Will Strengthen Age Assessments of Small Boat Arrivals, Gov.uk (Mar. 31, 2023), https://perma.cc/XT5L-TG4D. 106 Nationality and Borders Act 2022, c. 36, § 54. 107 Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 352. 108 Home Off., UK Border Agency, Every Child Matters—Change for Children: Statutory Guidance to the UK Border Agency on Making Arrangements to Safeguard and Promote the Welfare of Children, supra note 43, at 11.  109 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 45. 110 Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 352. 111 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 15. 112 Home Off., Interpreters Code of Conduct (ver. 4.0 Nov. 30, 2021), https://perma.cc/KHK9-YPEY.  113 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 15. 114 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, c. 11.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 169 for the Home Office contains several principles that must be considered in the interview, which include taking into account the child’s age, mental development, and maturity,115 when authorities are determining the credibility of the claim.116 Interviews may be waived in certain circumstances, such as if the children have been through an extremely traumatic experience, there is adequate documentary evidence to show this, and it is not in the best interests of the children for them to recount it.117  In some cases, the unaccompanied minor may turn 18 before the substantive asylum interview has occurred. In these cases, Home Office staff must, where possible, continue to follow the best practice for children’s cases.118   III.  Restrictions on Claiming Asylum  A.  Limits on Asylum Applications from Minors Who Transited Through Third Countries  The Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 provides that claims from individuals who have traveled through a safe third country and claimed, or could reasonably be expected to have claimed, asylum but failed to do so, or who have a connection to a safe third country, may have their claim declared inadmissible in the UK,119 if there is a reasonable prospect that they can be removed in a reasonable time to a safe third country. These provisions do not apply to unaccompanied minors. Instead, if the conditions above are met, the unaccompanied minor may be invited to withdraw the claim for protection in cases where a close family member in a third country is identified who is willing to care of the minor and is deemed suitable by the UK’s social services to do so, it is in the best interests of the child, the unaccompanied minor agrees to the reunification, and the third country agrees to admit the minor.120  B.  Safe Third Country Agreements  The UK has designated a number of countries as “safe”121 and, adopting a case-by-case approach, the Home Office certifies any applications for asylum from individuals entitled to residence in  115 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 43. 116 Asylum and Immigration (Treatment of Claimants, etc.) Act 2004, c. 19, https://perma.cc/Z9WT-AXVR; Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 351. 117 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 39. 118 Id. at 49. 119 Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, c. 41, § 80B-C.  120 Gov.uk, Inadmissibility: Safe Third Country Cases (Accessible) (last updated May 11, 2022), https://perma.cc/N5MR-HPN6.  121 These states are listed in the following order in the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002, c. 41, § 94(4): the Republic of Albania, Jamaica, Macedonia, the Republic of Moldova, Bolivia, Brazil, Ecuador, South Africa, Ukraine, India, Mongolia, Ghana (in respect of men), Nigeria (in respect of men), Bosnia-Herzegovina, Gambia (in respect of men), Kenya (in respect of men), Liberia (in respect of men), Malawi (in respect of men), Mali (in respect of men), Mauritius, Montenegro, Peru, Serbia, Sierra Leone (in respect of men), Kosovo, and South Korea.  \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 170 any of these states as clearly unfounded. There are no appeals from this decision.122 A clearly unfounded case is where the caseworker considers:   • a manifestly unfounded claim is a claim which is so clearly without substance that it is bound to fail • it is possible for a claim to be manifestly unfounded even if it takes more than a cursory look at the evidence to come to a view that there is nothing of substance in it.123   The secretary of state is responsible for designating countries as safe and does so by statutory instrument under powers granted by the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002. In order to designate a country, the secretary of state must be satisfied that   there is in general in that State or part no serious risk of persecution of persons entitled to reside in that State or part, and removal to that State or part of persons entitled to reside there will not in general contravene the United Kingdom’s obligations under the Human Rights Convention.124   If the country of origin is a designated state that does not have adequate reception arrangements, the Home Office will not certify the claim as clearly unfounded, and UASC leave should be granted.125  C.  Exclusions from the Refugee Convention   Unaccompanied minors are subject to Article 1F of the Refugee Convention. This exclusion provides that the Refugee Convention does not apply to individuals who have committed crimes against humanity or peace, war crimes, serious non-political crimes outside their country of refuge, or “acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations.”126 When determining whether this exclusion applies to a minor, the context of each case and the child’s age and maturity should be taken into account.  If an unaccompanied minor is convicted of a criminal offense in the UK and sentenced to 12 or more months of imprisonment, unlike adults, they are not subject to automatic deportation.127 The judge in the case can recommend that they be deported, or they can be “considered for deportation on grounds of being non-conducive to the public good, under the provisions of the  122 Id. § 94(3A). 123 Gov.uk, Guidance: Certification of Protection and Human Rights Claims Under Section 94 of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Clearly Unfounded Claims) (Accessible), supra note 45.

Protection Offered to Unaccompanied Minors  A.  Visas  There is no visa that may be obtained to travel to the UK to claim asylum. In order to claim asylum, the individual must be physically present in the UK and meet the criteria for asylum listed in Part I.3.C, above.  B.  Legal Representation  “Separated children” are eligible for legal aid for entry clearance, leave to enter or remain in the UK, appeals from an age assessment decision, and registration as a British citizen.130 The term “separated child” is defined as a person under the age of 18, or whose age is uncertain but is being treated as under 18, who is not being cared for by a parent or person with parental responsibility and is being looked after by a local authority.131 Legal aid includes the attendance of a legal representative during the substantive interview.132 No legal representation is provided during the unaccompanied minor’s first interview, known as the welfare interview, as this interview is solely related to their welfare.133  The Immigration Rules require the secretary of state to provide representatives, who can be legal representatives, social workers, charity workers, or other guardians, to the children to represent or assist them during the examination of the application.134 A representative should have “the opportunity to inform the unaccompanied child about the meaning and possible consequences of the interview and, where appropriate, how to prepare themselves for the interview.”135 The representative has the right to be present during the interview and ask questions and make comments within the framework that has been set by the interviewer.    128 Home Off., Criminal Casework Managing Foreign National Offenders Under 18 Years Old 6 (ver. 6.0, Jan. 14, 2016), https://perma.cc/3CYK-SM2R. 129 Id. at 21.  130 Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012, c. 10, sched. 1, pt. 1, ¶¶ 31A-31B, https://perma.cc/ME72-RZUZ (as inserted by the Legal Aid, Sentencing and Punishment of Offenders Act 2012 (Legal Aid for Separated Children) (Miscellaneous Amendments) Order 2019, SI 2019/1396, https://perma.cc/53QU-7EQ2, and amended by the Nationality and Borders Act 2022, c. 36).  131 Id. 132 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 23. 133 Id. at 23. 134 Immigration Rules, pt. 11, ¶ 352ZA. 135 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 172 During the review of an unaccompanied minor’s case, staff from the Home Office explain the asylum process to the minor and ensure the legal representative has the opportunity to meet with the minor before completing the statement of evidence form. If the unaccompanied minor does not have legal representation, a Home Office staff member must inform the minor’s social worker that the minor is entitled to free legal advice and recommend that the social worker discuss this with the child urgently.136  While the Home Office provides interpreters for the different stages of the asylum process who are required to act independently, legal representatives may, with Home Office approval, bring their own interpreters.137 If approved, an interpreter for the legal representative may only observe the proceedings and make comments at the end “but only insofar as they relate to a serious discrepancy in translation or because the child has not understood something.”138  In addition to a legal representative, a responsible adult who is independent of the Home Office must be present when fingerprints are taken of a child under the age of 16 years and during interviews with the child about the substance of the asylum claim.139 In some cases, with the consent of the child, the legal representative may also act as the responsible adult.140   The responsible adult must act in the best interests of the child and provides support for the child by: providing independent support to the child, looking after the well-being of the child, and raising any welfare concerns or needs. The responsible adult should also attend the asylum interview with the child to provide moral support and ensure the child is comfortable and understands the interview process and that any welfare needs are provided for. The responsible adult may also provide additional information to the interviewer that “may have a bearing on the child’s emotional wellbeing and fitness for interview . . . [such as that] the child had an early morning start to attend the interview.”141  C.  Role of Child Protection Agencies  As noted above, local authorities across Great Britain, and Health and Social Care Trusts in Northern Ireland, have a legal duty to safeguard and promote the welfare of children who are in need and provide “services appropriate to those children’s needs.”142 This includes the provision  136 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 34. 137 Id. at 15.  138 Id. at 16. 139 Id. at 20. 140 Id.  141 Id. at 21. 142 Children Act 1989, c. 41, § 17, https://perma.cc/NV9L-YLFD.

The guidance further notes that those aged under 16 are “likely to be placed with a foster parent or in a children’s home.”146   Children who are cared for by a person who is not a relative or official foster caregiver are considered to be in private foster care.147 When the Home Office becomes aware of a situation like this, it must ensure “that the relationship is genuinely one of welfare and that it is recognised and appropriately monitored by local authority children’s services.”148 Where the social services have confirmed that they are satisfied with the arrangements and have no welfare or safeguarding concerns, the children are considered to be accompanied asylum seeking children.149  Children over the age of 16 may be placed in accommodation that is classed as “other arrangements.”150 This type of accommodation is known as “unregulated accommodation” as it does not face the same registration requirements and inspections under the Care Standards Act 2000 that children’s homes or foster care providers do.151 Local authorities determine whether unaccompanied minors age 16 years old or over should be placed in supported lodgings, supported accommodation or shared accommodation. When making this decision, the “local authority must be satisfied that any such placement is in the best interests of each individual young person, with practice in line with all relevant statutory guidance and care planning regulations.”152  The government has stated that because the increase in small boat crossings put a “severe strain on the asylum accommodation system [the government] had no alternative but to temporarily use specialist hotels to give some unaccompanied minors a roof over their heads while local  143 Children Act 1989, c. 41, § 18; Children (Scotland) Act 1995, c. 36, § 25; Social Services and Well-Being (Wales) Act 2014 (anaw 4), § 75; Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, SI 1995/775, reg. 21.  144 Children Act 1989, c. 41, § 18; Children (Scotland) Act 1995, c. 36, § 25; Social Services and Well-Being (Wales) Act 2014 (anaw 4), § 75; Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, SI 1995/775, reg. 21.  145 Children Act 1989, c. 41, §§ 17, 20. 146 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 12. 147 Children Act 1989, c. 41, Children (Northern Ireland) Order 1995, SI 1995/775; Foster Children (Scotland) Act 1984, c. 56, https://perma.cc/325F-NJDV. 148 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 20.  149 Id. at 19.

Detention and Repatriation of Unaccompanied MinorsA. DetentionWhile the UK currently does not typically detain unaccompanied minors, they may be detained under the provisions of paragraph 16(2) of schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971, but only in short-term holding facilities for up to 24 hours.162 Guidance from the Home Office notes that,  [a]s a general principle, even where one of the statutory powers to detain is available in aparticular case, unaccompanied children must not be detained other than in the veryexceptional circumstances specified in paragraph 18B of schedule 2 to the Immigration Act153 726 Parl.

Failure to adhere to the legal powers and policy on detaining children can have very significant consequences.163  Such consequences include potential liability for the payment of damages in cases where the Home Office detains an individual it reasonably believes to be an adult, but who is later determined to be a child,164 along with causing a negative impact to the mental and physical health of the unaccompanied minor.165  A judgment from the Court of Appeal provides that children should only be placed in a holding facility when there is a concrete reason to do so. The local authority should be contacted as soon as the Home Office is aware the individual in detention is an unaccompanied minor.166  B.  Educational and Humanitarian Programs  Unaccompanied minors under the care of local authorities are entitled to accommodation, education,167 and health services,168 in the same manner as other children cared for in the UK, such as admission into public schools.169 This includes the provision of health, personal education, and a care plan,170 which must detail how an unaccompanied minor’s needs are being met.171   C.  Repatriation (Financial Assistance, Conditions)  1.  Voluntary Return   The Home Office provides a voluntary returns service. It is offered to an unaccompanied minor if the minor is being returned to the country of origin or another country. Discussions about return may only be started once the unaccompanied minor’s right of appeal has been exhausted,  163 Home Off., Assessing Age, supra note 95, at 14.  164 R v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2017] EWCA (Civ) 138, https://perma.cc/DD8X-37HN.  165 Home Off., Assessing Age, supra note 95, at 14. 166 AN & FA v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA (Civ) 1636. 167 Dep’t for Educ., Promoting the Education of Looked-After Children and Previously Looked-After Children: Statutory Guidance for Local Authorities (Feb. 2018), https://perma.cc/6SYJ-J72C.  168 Dep’t for Educ. & Dep’t Health, Promoting the Health and Well-Being of Looked-After Children: Statutory Guidance for Local Authorities, Clinical Commissioning Groups and NHS England (Mar. 2015), https://perma.cc/Q6FC-QUMC.  169 Children Act 1989, c. 41, § 17, https://perma.cc/NV9L-YLFD.

In these returns, the individual must be eligible and apply to the Home Office, which may provide up to £3,000 (about US$ 2,400) in reintegration support to pay for education for the minor upon return.173 Unaccompanied minors are not eligible for an assisted return if reception facilities in the country of return are inadequate.174  2.  Involuntary Return  When an unaccompanied minor’s application for asylum or other protection has failed, and the minor is not eligible for UASC or other form of leave, the minor is liable to be removed. The policy of the Home Office is that unaccompanied minors are only removed from the UK when “the secretary of state is satisfied that safe and adequate reception arrangements are in place in the country to which the child is to be removed.”175   Home Office guidance notes “[i]t is not possible to draw an exhaustive list of what counts as adequate reception as these will vary in kind and in degree and each case must be considered on its individual merits.”176 It does state that a home of the minor’s family or relatives, or reception arrangements from the country of destination, are considered when determining whether there are safe and adequate reception arrangements.177 While each case must be considered on its own merits, the Home Office considers reception arrangements in the country of origin to be adequate if it has arrangements with nongovernmental organizations to provide specific assistance to the unaccompanied minor upon return, if the child will be met by a representative from the child welfare authorities in the country of return upon arrival, and if there are health, education, and care services available to children.178  As noted above, in cases where reception arrangements in the country of return are inadequate, unaccompanied minors will be granted a form of temporary leave until they turn 18 and adequate reception arrangements are no longer a requirement for removal.      172 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 77. 173 Home Off., Voluntary and Assisted Returns 5 (Ver. 4.0, May 28, 2021), https://perma.cc/9KUT-TXBL.  174 Id. at 16. 175 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 70. 176 Id. 177 Id. 178 Id. at 71. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 177 VI.  Resettlement and Integration Programs  As noted above, unaccompanied minors are typically placed into the care of local authorities and are entitled to accommodation, education, and health services. Local authorities must put in place a care plan for minors in their care. The plan must include a plan for their upbringing, arrangements for health, education and training, emotional and behavioral development, and identity, taking into account their religion, racial origin, cultural and linguistic background, family and social relationships, social presentation and self-care skills.179  Unaccompanied minors aged 16 or older receive a pathway plan, created by the Home Office and local authorities. The pathway plan includes   the assessed or identified needs, identified timescales, action plan to meet these needs and the responsible person which assist the child to make the transition from care to the responsibilities of adulthood. It must be flexible and regularly updated. These matters will all be handled by the local authority.180   The pathway plan includes items such as education, job opportunities, and training where appropriate and how these can be funded. The unaccompanied minor’s immigration status is taken into account in these plans, along with the possibility that the claim may fail.181 Home Office guidance notes that pathway plans typically reflect the provisions of the Children Act 1989.   At age 18, the local authority continues to have a duty to support individuals who have left care until they are 21 years of age, and local authorities continue to act as a corporate parent to those leaving care between the ages of 21 to 25.182 To do this, local authorities “should support [care leavers] in a way that is consistent with the way in which birth parents support their own children as they grow up, helping them transition to independent life.”183  Local authorities caring for unaccompanied minors receive funding of between £114 to £143 (about US$142 to US$179) per night per unaccompanied minor,184 and can receive a lump sum of  179 Care Planning, Placement and Case Review (England) Regulations 2010, SI 2010/959, Reg. 5.  180 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 74. 181 Dep’t for Educ., Care of Unaccompanied Migrant Children and Child Victims of Modern Slavery Statutory Guidance for Local Authorities, supra note 18. 182 Children and Social Work Act 2017, c. 16, § 1, https://perma.cc/B6CX-5DYA. 183 Dep’t for Educ., Extending Personal Adviser Support to All Care Leavers to Age 25: Statutory Guidance for Local Authorities 37 (Feb. 2018), https://perma.cc/98WA-3QJA.

Family Reunification  A.  Family Tracing   Once an unaccompanied minor has made a claim for asylum in the UK, regulation 6 of the Asylum Seeker (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2005 places a duty on the Home Office to “endeavour to trace the members of the minor’s family as soon as possible after the minor makes his claim for asylum.”187 Family tracing is considered to be   • restoring family links where they have been broken  • maintaining established family links  • obtaining information as to the family’s current circumstances to assist in the identification of a durable solution.188  During the unaccompanied minor case review, the Home Office explains the asylum and family tracing process to the minor.189 At all stages, safeguarding and promoting the welfare of the child should be considered,190 and the child’s best interests should be a primary, but not the only, consideration.191  In searching for family members, the “Home Office may take appropriate steps to trace them.”192 In addition to any tracing undertaken by the Home Office, the unaccompanied minor should be informed about family tracing services provided by the British Red Cross, which is an independent humanitarian organization.193 While the Home Office can request that the unaccompanied minor inform them of the outcome of family tracing, any findings from the British Red Cross’s family tracing are confidential and will only be disclosed to the unaccompanied minor.194   Family tracing is not conducted in cases where the unaccompanied minor displays indicators of having been trafficked, such as fear of close family members or distress at the prospect of locating  185 Gov.uk, Guidance, Temporary Additional Funding - National Transfer Scheme (Accessible Version) , supra note 159, at ¶ 3.  186 Id. at ¶ 3.3. 187 Asylum Seekers (Reception Conditions) Regulations 2005, SI 2005/7, reg. 6, https://perma.cc/K7BD-CJJN.  188 Home Off., Family Tracing 5 (ver. 3.0, Dec. 31, 2020), https://perma.cc/Y8HB-K6MM. 189 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 34. 190 Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009, c. 11, § 55. 191 Home Off., Family Tracing, supra note 188 at 12. 192 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 36. 193 Id. 194 Id. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 179 them, and Home Office staff suspect that family members facilitated the trafficking.195 The Home Office also does not begin family tracing where the child is in contact with the family and knows the family’s location or where it accepts the child’s claim that there are no surviving family members.196  B.  Family Reunification  The Home Office notes that reuniting unaccompanied minors with their families is typically the ultimate goal, but the default location for reunification is not the UK. Children with protection status are ineligible to sponsor family members under the refugee family reunion rules.197 The government has stated this is to avoid creating an incentive for children being forced to leave their families and traveling to the UK in the hopes of reuniting the entire family there.198 Thus, the relationship requirements for family reunion apply only to the partners and children of refugees in the UK, not to the parents or siblings of children with protection status in the UK.199 Family reunification may occur in the UK using the Article 8 provisions of the Immigration Rules, which provide   Where an applicant does not meet the requirements for a partner under FRP.4.1. or for a child under FRP.5.1. to FRP 6.2., the decision maker must consider, on the basis of the information provided by the applicant, whether there are exceptional circumstances which would make a refusal of the application a breach of Article 8 of the ECHR, because such refusal would result in unjustifiably harsh consequences for the applicant or their family member, whose Article 8 rights it is evident from the information provided would be affected by a decision to refuse the application.200  Government policy notes that “decision makers must use their discretion and consider whether there are any compelling compassionate factors which may warrant a grant of leave outside the rules. Each case must be considered on its individual merits and include consideration of the best interests of the child in the UK.”201   An unaccompanied minor may be reunited with their family, even in cases where they have been granted temporary refugee permission or temporary humanitarian permission, if refusing the application would breach the UK’s obligation under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights, or where “there are insurmountable obstacles to family life continuing elsewhere other than in the UK and if the applicant is a child, and the decision maker is satisfied that family reunion in the UK is in the child’s best interests in line with the secretary of state’s duty under  195 Home Off., Children’s Asylum Claims, supra note 21, at 36. 196 Home Off., Family Tracing, supra note 189, at 5. 197 Sec’y State for Home Dep’t, Cm 8778, Human Rights of Unaccompanied Migrant Children and Young People in the UK 12 (2013-14), https://perma.cc/Y4KH-EMWQ.  198 Home Off., Family Reunion: For Individuals With Protection Status in the UK 25 (ver. 9.0, Apr. 12, 2023), https://perma.cc/J7PP-QUHE. 199 Immigration Rules, Appendix Family Reunion (Protection), FRP 4.1, 5.1, https://perma.cc/5AG8-W634. 200 Id.  201 Home Off., Family Reunion: For Individuals With Protection Status in the UK, supra note 199,198 at 25. \fLegal Treatment of Unaccompanied Minors: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 180 section 55 of the Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009.”202 If the decision maker is satisfied these requirements are met, the application will be granted, and leave will be granted for the same duration as the unaccompanied minor, up to a maximum time of 33 months.203 Whether the child can be reunited with their family is one of the primary considerations as to whether reception conditions in the minor’s country of origin are satisfactory and that removal can be conducted safely.204 In cases where the family has been traced and it is not safe for the minor to be removed to the country in which the family is located,205 reuniting them in the UK is an option.  202 Immigration Rules, Appendix Family Reunion (Protection), FPR 7.2(b). 203 Id.

No. 59,941© 2023  The New York Times CompanySATURDAY, OCTOBER 14, 2023A Bit Origin Ltd. operation in Wyoming near an Air Force base.STEPHEN SPERANZA FOR THE NEW YORK TIMESWhen a company with Chineseorigins broke ground last year ona crypto-mining operation inCheyenne, Wyo., a team at Micro-soft that assesses national securi-ty threats sounded the alarm.Not only was the site next doorto a Microsoft data center thatsupported the Pentagon, it wasabout a mile away from an AirForce base that controlled nucle-ar-armed intercontinental ballis-tic missiles.The location could allow theChinese to “pursue full-spectrumintelligence collection opera-tions,” the Microsoft team wrote inan August 2022 report to the Com-mittee on Foreign Investment inthe United States, a federal bodythat monitors threats posed byoverseas investors.Microsoft’s warning did not gounheeded. Speaking on the condi-tion of anonymity, U.S. govern-ment officials told The New YorkTimes last week that they hadbeen tracking the Wyoming oper-ation for months. One official saidthat measures had been taken tomitigate potential intelligence col-lection but declined to elaborate.In addition, the mining companysaid it responded to queries fromthe federal investment commit-tee.The national security concernsabout the Wyoming site, previ-ously unreported, reflect abroader unease about a recentsurge in Chinese Bitcoin minesacross the country.Aside from intelligence-gather-ing worries, the mines, which arelarge warehouses or containerspacked with specialized comput-ers, put immense pressure onpower grids. The computers typi-cally run around the clock while“mining” for the digital coins, themost popular among the variouscryptocurrencies.Brian Harrell, a former assist-ant secretary for infrastructureprotection at the Department ofHomeland Security during theTrump administration, said the Chinese Bitcoin Mines in U.S. Fuel SuspicionsBy GABRIEL J.X. DANCEand MICHAEL FORSYTHEContinued on Page A14Possible Security Risksand Stress on GridLouise Glück, an American poetwhose searing, deeply personalwork, often filtered throughthemes of classical mythology, re-ligion and the natural world, wonher practically every honor avail-able, including the Pulitzer Prize,the National Book Award and, in2020, the Nobel Prize for Litera-ture, died on Friday at her home inCambridge, Mass. She was 80.Her death was confirmed byJonathan Galassi, her editor atFarrar, Straus & Giroux, The As-sociated Press said. Richard Dem-ing, a friend and former colleagueof hers in the English departmentat Yale, said the cause was cancer.Ms. Glück (pronounced glick)was widely considered to beamong the country’s greatest liv-ing poets, long before she won theNobel. She began publishing inthe 1960s and received some ac-claim in the ’70s, but she ce-mented her reputation in the ’80sand early ’90s with a string ofbooks, including “Triumph of Ach-illes” (1985), which won the Na-tional Book Critics Circle Award;“Ararat” (1990); and “The WildIris” (1992), which won the Pulitz-er Prize.Her work was both deeply per-sonal — “Ararat,” for example,drew on the pain she experiencedover the death of her father — andbroadly accessible, both to critics,who praised her clarity and pre-cise lyricism, and to the broader LOUISE GLÜCK, 1943-2023Nobel Laureate Poet’s PrismWas Pain, Trauma and LossBy CLAY RISENLouise Glück in late 2020.DANIEL EBERSOLE/NOBEL PRIZE OUTREACH, VIA REUTERSContinued on Page A24JERUSALEM — Israel calledfor the evacuation of more than amillion citizens from the northernGaza Strip and concentrated morearmed forces around the enclaveon Friday, signaling that it may bepreparing to escalate the war withHamas.The United Nations and inter-national aid and rights groupscalled Israel’s directive unwork-able or unlawful, and urged it torescind the evacuation. A U.N.spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric,said in a statement that the evacu-ation could not be conducted“without devastating humanitar-ian consequences,” and “couldtransform what is already a trage-dy into a calamitous situation.”The Israeli military did not backaway from the evacuation plan onFriday but softened its stance,suggesting there was no deadline,after initially saying that peopleshould leave northern Gazawithin 24 hours. “We understandit will take time,” Rear Adm. Dan-iel Hagari, the chief militaryspokesman, told reporters.In Gaza, already cut off from vi-tal supplies, many people fledwith what they could carry, notknowing what conditions awaitedthem in the south or how long theywould be gone. But many othersremained, out of necessity, fear ordefiance. Hamas, the militantgroup that controls Gaza and con-ducted a deadly, large-scale incur-sion into Israel last weekend, hasurged people to stay put, callingthe Israeli directive “psychologi-cal warfare.”On both sides, there is wide-ISRAEL IS PUSHINGGAZA EVACUATIONAS SOLDIERS MASSBoth Sides Prepare for Ground InvasionAmid Criticism by Aid GroupsThis article is by Patrick Kingsley,Farnaz Fassihi, Edward Wong andVictoria Kim.Continued on Page A85 milesSHARIA AL-RASHIDSALAH AL-DINMediterraneanSeaI S R A E LGaza CityArea ofevacuationGAZAEREZCROSSINGWadi GazaTHE NEW YORK TIMESPalestinians who left the northern Gaza Strip made their way south on Friday near Khan Yunis as calls to evacuate persisted.SAMAR ABU ELOUF FOR THE NEW YORK TIMESmore than 700,000 Palestinianswere expelled or fled their homesin present-day Israel during thewar surrounding the nation’s es-tablishment.

Since the brutalterror attacks on Israelis last Sat-urday, many New York Jews saidthey have put aside those differ-ences.This week, thousands of Jewsfrom across the political and theo-logical spectrum gathered outsidethe United Nations, manywrapped in blue and white Israeliflags, coming together both togrieve and to condemn the as-sault.It was a show of unity thatwould have been hard to imaginepreviously, said Eric Goldstein,chief executive of UJA-Federationof New York. “To a large degreethe Jewish community has cometogether in this moment.”New York City has long haduniquely close emotional bondswith Israel, which strengthen intimes of crisis — a relationshipforged through the atrocities inEurope that led to the country’sfounding and created much ofNew York’s Jewish community.Jewish New Yorkers have lookedat Israel as an emblem of homeand survival in a hostile world.Tens of thousands of New York-ers have relatives in Israel, Mr.Goldstein said. When Israelcomes under attack, Jewish NewYorkers — including those whomight rarely think about Israel —feel the threat.One measure of this relation-ship: Gov. Kathy Hochul, MayorEric Adams and Attorney GeneralLetitia James all addressed thecrowd outside the United Nations,supporting both Israel and thecity’s Jewish community.Yet that relationship has had itsdivisions, with many progressivecongregations and secular Jewsstrongly criticizing Israel. Thispolarization has increased sincethe rise of the far-right govern-ment of Prime Minister BenjaminNetanyahu and a judicial reformprogram aimed at weakening Is-rael’s court system.Amichai Lau-Lavie, an Israeli-born rabbi who has been vocalabout both his criticisms and hislove for Israel, said it was time toput aside divisions and focus onshared grief.“Right now people are hurting,and we just want to hold each oth-er’s hand and let the divisions bein the back,” he said. “Our politicalposition now makes no difference.Left, right, pro-occupation, anti-occupation, don’t know about it —we’re hurting and we’re shockedand we’re horrified and we wantIsrael to get through this.”Particularly for liberal congre-gations, the attacks haveprompted a reconsideration of thelanguage they use in discussingIsrael, said Rabbi David Ingber,who leads the progressive Shaken and Grieving, Jewish New Yorkers Put Aside DifferencesBy JOHN LELANDContinued on Page A15U(D54G1D)y+&!$!]!?!%SAN FRANCISCO — Microsoftsaid on Friday that it had closedits $69 billion purchase of the vid-eo game giant Activision Blizzard,overcoming significant regula-tory hurdles in Britain and theUnited States and signaling thatthe tech industry’s giants are stillfree to use their cash hoards to geteven bigger.The deal, the largest consumertech acquisition since AOL boughtTime Warner more than two dec-ades ago, won approval fromBritish regulators on Friday, thelast remaining regulatory obsta-cle.The completion of Microsoft’sActivision acquisition is a clearsignal that several years of gov-ernments around the world scruti-nizing big tech companies have sofar done little to curb their power,their growth or their ability to inkmegadeals.

 \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  1         INTRODUCTION   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  2  Legislative Basis for the INCSR  The Department of State’s International Narcotics Control Strategy Report (INCSR) has been prepared in accordance with section 489 of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (the \"FAA,\" 22 U.S.C. § 2291).  The 2019 INCSR, published in March 2019, covers the year January 1 to December 31, 2018 and is published in two volumes, the second of which covers money laundering and financial crimes.  In addition to addressing the reporting requirements of section 489 of the FAA (as well as sections 481(d)(2) and 484(c) of the FAA and section 804 of the Narcotics Control Trade Act of 1974, as amended), the INCSR provides the factual basis for the designations contained in the President’s report to Congress on the major drug-transit or major illicit drug producing countries initially set forth in section 591 of the Kenneth M. Ludden Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act, 2002 (P.L. 107-115) (the \"FOAA\"), and now made permanent pursuant to section 706 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228) (the \"FRAA\").    Section 706 of the FRAA requires that the President submit an annual report no later than September 15 identifying each country determined by the President to be a major drug-transit country or major illicit drug producing country.  The President is also required in that report to identify any country on the majors list that has \"failed demonstrably . . . to make substantial efforts\" during the previous 12 months to adhere to international counternarcotics agreements and to take certain counternarcotics measures set forth in U.S. law.  U.S. assistance under the current foreign operations appropriations act may not be provided to any country designated as having \"failed demonstrably\" unless the President determines that the provision of such assistance is vital to U.S. national interests or that the country, at any time after the President’s initial report to Congress, has made \"substantial efforts\" to comply with the counternarcotics conditions in the legislation.  This prohibition does not affect humanitarian, counternarcotics, and certain other types of assistance that are authorized to be provided notwithstanding any other provision of law.   The FAA requires a report on the extent to which each country or entity that received assistance under chapter 8 of Part I of the Foreign Assistance Act in the past two fiscal years has \"met the goals and objectives of the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (the \"1988 UN Drug Convention\").”   Beginning in 2007, pursuant to The Combat Methamphetamine Enforcement Act (CMEA) (The USA Patriot Improvement and Reauthorization Act 2005, Title VII, P.L. 109-177), amending sections 489 and 490 of the Foreign Assistance Act (22 USC 2291h and 2291) section 722, the INCSR was expanded to include reporting on the five countries that export the largest amounts of methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as the five countries importing the largest amounts of these chemicals and which have the highest rate of diversion of the chemicals for methamphetamine production.  This expanded reporting also includes additional information on efforts to control methamphetamine precursor chemicals, as well as estimates of legitimate demand for these methamphetamine precursors, prepared by most parties to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and submitted to the International Narcotics Control Board.  The CMEA also requires a Presidential determination by March 1 of each year on whether the five countries that legally exported and the five countries that legally imported the largest amount of precursor \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  3  chemicals (under FAA section 490) have cooperated with the United States to prevent these substances from being used to produce methamphetamine or have taken adequate steps on their own to achieve full compliance with the 1988 UN Drug Control Convention.  This determination may be exercised by the Secretary of State pursuant to Executive Order 12163 and by the Deputy Secretary of State pursuant to State Department Delegation of Authority 245-2.  Although the Convention does not contain a list of goals and objectives, it does set forth a number of obligations that the parties agree to undertake.  Generally speaking, it requires the parties to take legal measures to outlaw and punish all forms of illicit drug production, trafficking, and drug money laundering; to control chemicals that can be used to process illicit drugs; and to cooperate in international efforts to these ends.  The statute lists actions by foreign countries on the following issues as relevant to evaluating performance under the 1988 UN Drug Convention: illicit cultivation, production, distribution, sale, transport and financing, and money laundering, asset seizure, extradition, mutual legal assistance, law enforcement and transit cooperation, precursor chemical control, and demand reduction.   In attempting to evaluate whether countries and certain entities are meeting the goals and objectives of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the Department has used the best information it has available.  The 2019 INCSR covers countries that range from major drug producing and drug-transit countries, where drug control is a critical element of national policy, to small countries or entities where drug issues or the capacity to deal with them are minimal.  The reports vary in the extent of their coverage.  For key drug-control countries, where considerable information is available, comprehensive reports are provided.  For some smaller countries or entities where only limited information is available, reports include whatever data the responsible U.S. diplomatic mission could provide.   The country chapters report upon actions taken – including plans, programs, and, where applicable, timetables – toward fulfillment of Convention obligations.  Because the 1988 UN Drug Convention’s subject matter is so broad and availability of information on elements related to performance under the Convention varies widely within and among countries, the Department’s views on the extent to which a given country or entity is meeting the goals and objectives of the Convention are based on the overall response of the country or entity to those goals and objectives.  Reports will often include discussion of foreign legal and regulatory structures.  Although the Department strives to provide accurate information, this report should not be used as the basis for determining legal rights or obligations under U.S. or foreign law.   Some countries and other entities are not yet parties to the 1988 UN Drug Convention; some do not have status in the United Nations and cannot become parties.  For such countries or entities, we have nonetheless considered actions taken by those countries or entities in areas covered by the Convention as well as plans (if any) for becoming parties and for bringing their legislation into conformity with the Convention’s requirements.  Other countries have taken reservations, declarations, or understandings to the 1988 UN Drug Convention or other relevant treaties; such reservations, declarations, or understandings are generally not detailed in this report.  For some of the smallest countries or entities that have not been designated by the President as major illicit drug producing or major drug-transit countries, the Department has insufficient information to make a judgment as to whether the goals and objectives of the Convention are being met.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  4   Unless otherwise noted in the relevant country chapters, the Department’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL) considers all countries and other entities with which the United States has bilateral narcotics agreements to be meeting the goals and objectives of those agreements.   Information concerning counternarcotics assistance is provided, pursuant to section 489(b) of the FAA, in section entitled \"U.S. Government Assistance.\"   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  5  Major Illicit Drug Producing, Drug-Transit, Significant Source, Precursor Chemical, and Money Laundering Countries   Section 489(a)(3) of the FAA requires the INCSR to identify:  (A) major illicit drug producing and major drug-transit countries;  (B) major sources of precursor chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics; or  (C) major money laundering countries.  These countries are identified below.  Major Illicit Drug Producing and Major Drug-Transit Countries   A major illicit drug producing country is one in which:  (A) 1,000 hectares or more of illicit opium poppy is cultivated or harvested during a year;  (B) 1,000 hectares or more of illicit coca is cultivated or harvested during a year; or  (C) 5,000 hectares or more of illicit cannabis is cultivated or harvested during a year, unless the President determines that such illicit cannabis production does not significantly affect the United States.  [FAA § 481(e)(2)]  A major drug-transit country is one:  (A) that is a significant direct source of illicit narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances significantly affecting the United States; or  (B) through which are transported such drugs or substances. [FAA § 481(e)(5)]   The following major illicit drug producing and/or drug-transit countries were identified and notified to Congress by the President on September 11, 2018, consistent with section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (Public Law 107-228):   Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.   Of these 22 countries, Bolivia and Venezuela were designated by the President as having “failed demonstrably” during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA.  The President determined, however, in accordance with provisions of Section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that continued support for bilateral programs to aid the people of Venezuela is vital to the national interests of the United States.  Major Precursor Chemical Source Countries   The following countries and jurisdictions have been identified to be major sources of precursor or essential chemicals used in the production of illicit narcotics:   Afghanistan, Argentina, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Burma, Canada, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Egypt, El Salvador, Germany, Guatemala, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  6  Nigeria, Pakistan, Peru, Poland, Republic of Korea, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, the United Kingdom, and Venezuela.   Information is provided pursuant to section 489 of the FAA in the section entitled \"Chemical Controls.\"  Major Money Laundering Countries   A major money laundering country is defined by statute as one “whose financial institutions engage in currency transactions involving significant amounts of proceeds from international narcotics trafficking” [FAA § 481(e)(7)].  More information on the methodology is set forth in Volume II of the INCSR in the section entitled \"Legislative Basis and Methodology for the INCSR.\"  The following countries/jurisdictions have been identified this year in this category:   Afghanistan, Albania, Algeria, Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, Armenia, Aruba, Azerbaijan, Bahamas, Barbados, Belgium, Belize, Benin, Bolivia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Brazil, British Virgin Islands, Burma, Cabo Verde, Canada, Cayman Islands, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Curaçao, Cyprus, Dominica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, Guyana, Haiti, Honduras, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, Italy, Jamaica, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Laos, Liberia, Macau, Malaysia, Mexico, Morocco, Mozambique, Netherlands, Nicaragua, Nigeria, Pakistan, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Senegal, Serbia, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Sint Maarten Spain, Suriname, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States of America, Uzbekistan, Venezuela, and Vietnam.  Further information on these countries/jurisdictions and United States money laundering policies, as required by section 489 of the FAA, is set forth in Volume II of the INCSR in the section entitled \"Money Laundering and Financial Crimes.\"    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  7  Presidential Determination  THE WHITE HOUSE  WASHINGTON     September 11, 2018 Presidential Determination No. 2018-21806  MEMORANDUM FOR THE SECRETARY OF STATE  SUBJECT:  Presidential Determination on Major Drug Transit or Major Illicit Drug Producing Countries for Fiscal Year 2019  By the authority vested to me as President by the Constitution and the laws of the United States, including Section 706(1) of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, Fiscal Year 2003 (P.L. 107-228) (FRAA), I hereby identify the following countries as major drug transit or major illicit drug producing countries:  Afghanistan, The Bahamas, Belize, Bolivia, Burma, Colombia, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, El Salvador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, India, Jamaica, Laos, Mexico, Nicaragua, Pakistan, Panama, Peru, and Venezuela.  A country’s presence on the foregoing Majors List is not necessarily a reflection of its government’s counternarcotics efforts or level of cooperation with the United States.  Consistent with the statutory definition of a major drug transit or drug producing country set forth in section 481(e) (2) and (5) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA), the reason major drug transit or illicit drug producing countries are placed on the list is the combination of geographic, commercial, and economic factors that allow drugs to transit or be produced, even if a government has engaged in robust and diligent narcotics control law enforcement measures.  Pursuant to Section 706(2)(A) of the FRAA, I hereby designate Bolivia and Venezuela as countries that have failed demonstrably during the previous 12 months to adhere to their obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and take the measures set forth in section 489(a)(1) of the FAA.  Included with this determination are justifications for the designations of Bolivia and Venezuela, as required by Section 706(2)(B) of the FRAA.  I have also determined, in accordance with provisions of Section 706(3)(A) of the FRAA, that support for programs to aid the promotion of democracy in Venezuela are vital to the national interests of the United States.  Combatting the ongoing United States opioid epidemic is one of my Administration’s most urgent priorities.  The Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which I signed into law this spring, dedicated nearly $4 billion in additional funding to confront this national crisis.  My Administration is committed to addressing all factors fueling this drug crisis, which is devastating communities across America, including steps to curb over-prescription, expand access to treatment and recovery programs, improve public education programs to prevent illicit drug use before it begins, and to strengthening domestic drug enforcement at our borders and throughout our Nation.  Alongside these massive and historic United States efforts, I expect the \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  8  governments of countries where illicit drugs originate and through which they transit to similarly strengthen their commitments to reduce dangerous drug production and trafficking.  In this respect, I am deeply concerned that illicit drug crops have expanded over successive years in Colombia, Mexico, and Afghanistan, and are now at record levels.  Drug production and trafficking in these three countries directly affect United States national interests and the health and safety of American citizens.  Heroin originating in Mexico and cocaine from Colombia are claiming thousands of lives annually in the United States.  Afghanistan’s illicit opium economy promotes corruption, funds the Taliban, and undermines the country’s security, which thousands of United States service men and women help defend.  Despite the efforts of law enforcement and security forces, these countries are falling behind in the fight to eradicate illicit crops and reduce drug production and trafficking.  These governments must redouble their efforts to rise to the challenge posed by the criminal organizations producing and trafficking these drugs, and achieve greater progress over the coming year in stopping and reversing illicit drug production and trafficking.  The United States will continue its strong support for international efforts against drug production and trafficking, as well as to strengthen prevention and treatment efforts in the United States.  The urgency of our national drug epidemic requires significant and measurable results immediately, in the coming year and in the future.    You are authorized and directed to submit this designation, with the Bolivia and Venezuela memoranda of justification, under Section 706 of the FRAA, to the Congress, and publish it in the Federal Register.  /S/ Donald J. Trump \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  9  MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR ILLICIT DRUG TRANSIT OR ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCING COUNTRIES FOR FY 2019  Bolivia  During the past 12 months, the Bolivian government has failed demonstrably to make sufficient efforts to meet its obligations under the international counternarcotics agreements or to uphold the counternarcotics measures set forth in Section 489 (a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act (FAA) of 1961, as amended (FAA  According to coca cultivation estimates from the United States government, the Government of Bolivia, and the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Bolivia remains the third largest producer of cocaine in the world.  It is also a major transit zone for Peruvian cocaine.  Cocaine cultivation in Bolivia continues to increase; the United States government estimated coca cultivation increased by three percent to 37,500 hectares (ha) in 2016 from 36,500 in 2015.  Per United States government estimates, potential pure cocaine production has more than doubled in Bolivia over the past decade, and increased eight percent to 275 metric tons from 2015 to 2016.  In addition to excessive production levels, Bolivia’s inadequate controls over its legal markets are of concern.  Until 2017, Bolivian law permitted 12,000 hectares of licit coca production per year.  In March 2017, President Evo Morales signed into law a bill that replaces Bolivia’s former counternarcotics law and nearly doubles those limits; the area available for licit coca production will increase from 12,000 to 22,000 hectares.  This exceeds the amount of coca needed for traditional purposes by 38 percent, according to a European Union (EU) estimate.  UNODC officials have estimated that 90 percent of the Chapare region’s coca cultivation is destined for illicit cocaine production and not traditional consumption.  In 2013, Bolivia re-acceded to the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs with a reservation permitting coca to be used only within Bolivia for traditional, cultural, and medicinal purposes.  Despite these stated conditions, Bolivia continues to promote the use of coca in other countries and discuss potential export opportunities for coca products.  These actions undermine Bolivia’s commitments to its international drug control obligations.  As a matter of official policy, the Government of Bolivia does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking.  President Morales and other senior officials have acknowledged serious corruption problems in the judiciary and police.  Approximately 60 police officers were investigated for corruption associated with drug trafficking in 2015, the most recent year for which data is available.  Corruption, interference by other branches of government, and insufficient judicial resources undermine due process and create delays in the administration of justice.  Increased Bolivian counternarcotics cooperation with other countries and in international fora would be welcome.  Bolivia receives most of its foreign counternarcotic financial support from the European Union (EU).  The EU is currently implementing a three-year (2016-2018) \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  10  assistance program budgeted at $50 million, and also provides an additional $10 million to support UNODC drug control programs and technical assistance through a contractor.  The United States has not had a counternarcotics presence in Bolivia, but U.S. officials consult with international organizations and third-country governments involved in supporting Bolivian drug control goals and efforts to strengthen the rule of law.  A customs mutual assistance agreement between the Government of Bolivia and United States to foster improved information sharing was signed in July 2017, which permits information exchanges and collaboration to prevent illegal shipments and related criminal activities, including drug trafficking.  Bolivia participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in November 2017, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  The United States and Bolivia are parties to a 1995 extradition treaty that permits the extradition of nationals for the most serious offenses, including drug trafficking.  Bolivia and the United States do not have a mutual legal assistance treaty, but both countries can request assistance through various multilateral conventions to which both are parties.  In accordance with United States legislation, the determination that Bolivia has failed demonstrably to make substantial efforts to adhere to its obligations under international counternarcotics agreements and to take counternarcotics measures set forth in the FAA results in the withholding of certain kinds of U.S. assistance, with exceptions for humanitarian and counternarcotics assistance under the FAA.  United States assistance to and relations with Bolivia are extremely limited.  It is not in the vital interest of the United States to grant a national interest waiver to Bolivia, given that any assistance necessitating such a waiver is neither contemplated by the United States, nor actively pursued by the Government of Bolivia.        \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  11  MEMORANDUM OF JUSTIFICATION FOR MAJOR DRUG TRANSIT OR ILLICIT DRUG PRODUCING COUNTRIES FOR FY 2019  Venezuela  During the past 12 months, the Venezuelan government failed demonstrably to make sufficient efforts to meet its obligations under the international counternarcotics agreements or to uphold the counternarcotics measures set forth in section 489 (a)(1) of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended (FAA).  A national interest waiver for Fiscal Year 2019 for Venezuela permits support for United States government-funded bilateral assistance programs vital to the national interest of the United States, such as democracy building and human rights advocacy.  Venezuela remained a major drug-transit country in 2018.  Venezuela is one of the preferred trafficking routes for illegal drugs, predominately cocaine, from South America to the Caribbean region, Central America, the United States, Western Africa, and Europe, due to its porous western border with Colombia, weak judicial system, sporadic international counternarcotics cooperation, and permissive and corrupt environment.    Public corruption, including among senior government officials, is a major problem in Venezuela, making it easier for drug-trafficking organizations to smuggle illegal drugs.  The Venezuelan government, as a matter of policy, does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor does it condone laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs; however, the Maduro regime knowingly maintains a United States designated Narcotics Kingpin in its Cabinet.   On February 13, 2017, the United States designated Venezuelan Executive Vice President Tareck El Aissami pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for his involvement in international narcotics trafficking activities.  El Aissami facilitated, coordinated, and protected other narcotics traffickers operating in Venezuela.  Specifically, El Aissami received payment for the facilitation of drug shipments belonging to Venezuelan drug kingpin Walid Makled Garcia.  El Aissami also is linked to coordinating drug shipments to Los Zetas, a violent Mexican drug cartel, as well as providing protection to Colombian drug lord Daniel Barrera Barrera and Venezuelan drug trafficker Hermagoras Gonzalez Polanco.  In November 2016, nephews of Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, Efrain Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were convicted by a federal court in New York of conspiracy to traffic 800 kg of cocaine to the United States.  In 2017, the nephews were unsuccessful in overturning their convictions on appeal.  In August 2016, the United States unsealed indictments against General Nester Luis Reverol Torres, the former director of ONA and former commander of the National Guard, and Edylberto Jose Molina Molina, former sub-director of ONA, for participating in an international cocaine trafficking conspiracy.  Immediately following the U.S. indictments, President Nicolas Maduro appointed Reverol as Minister of Interior, Justice, and Peace, in which he is responsible for overseeing both ONA and the National Guard.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  12  In September 2015, the United States unsealed indictments against former Bolivarian Intelligence Service (SEBIN) chief of finance Pedro Luis Martin Olivares and former anti-drug official in the Scientific, Penal, and Criminal Investigative Corps (CICPC) Jesus Alfredo Itriago for alleged involvement in drug trafficking activities affecting the United States.  In 2013, the U.S. Department of the Treasury added Vassyly Kotosky Villarroel-Ramirez, a former captain in the Venezuelan National Guard, to the “Specially Designated National and Blocked Persons (SDN)” list under the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act (Kingpin Act).  The Venezuelan National Guard reported the arrest of Villarroel-Ramirez in July of 2015.  In 2008, the Treasury designated former Minister of Defense and current Trujillo state Governor, Henry Rangel Silva and Guárico state Governor Ramón Emilio Rodríguez Chacín as “Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers” pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act for assisting the Fuerzas Armadas Revolucionarias de Colombia (FARC) in trafficking narcotics.  The Venezuelan government has yet to take action against these or other government and military officials with known links to the FARC or Mexican drug cartels.  In 2018, the Venezuelan government engaged in minimal bilateral law enforcement cooperation with the United States.  Venezuelan authorities do not effectively prosecute drug traffickers, in part due to political corruption.  Additionally, Venezuelan law enforcement officers lack the equipment, training, and resources required to significantly impede the operations of major drug trafficking organizations.  The Venezuelan government occasionally reports drug seizures, arrests, and destruction of drugs and airstrips to the public, but did not share evidence about the destruction of illicit drug with U.S. officials.  Drug control cooperation between Venezuela and the United States has been limited and inconsistent since 2005, when Venezuela refused to sign a negotiated amendment to the U.S.-Venezuela bilateral Letter of Agreement on drug control cooperation.  The United States and Venezuela have a bilateral agreement for counter drug operations.  The agreement enables both countries to stop, board, and search vessels flying the other’s flag.  Furthermore, this agreement enables direct case information sharing, and expedited vessel registry checks.  In 2016, the Venezuelan government cooperated with the United States Coast Guard in six documented maritime drug interdiction cases, compared to 10 cases in 2015.  Venezuela did not attend the 2017 International Drug Enforcement Conference for the first time in four years.  To advance cooperation with the United States, the Venezuelan government could increase the exchange of narcotics-related information to lead to more drug-related arrests, help dismantle criminal networks, aid in the prosecution of criminals engaged in narcotics trafficking, and stem the flow of illicit drugs transiting Venezuela.  The United States and Venezuela are parties to an extradition treaty that entered into force in 1923.  Although the 1999 Venezuelan constitution bars the extradition of Venezuelan nationals, Venezuela periodically extradites or deports non-Venezuelan nationals to the United States for prosecution.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Introduction  13  Pursuant to Section 706 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act of Fiscal Year 2003, FRAA, though Venezuela has failed demonstrably, a national interest waiver under the FRAA allows the continuation of certain United States bilateral assistance programs to Venezuela; humanitarian and counternarcotics assistance can be provided to Venezuela without a national interest waiver.           \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  14           POLICY AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENTS    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  15  Overview  Volume 1 of the 2019 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report provides an overview of actions taken during the previous year by the governments of nearly 70 countries to reduce illicit drug production, trafficking, and use.  This global challenge bears more direct impact on the health and safety of Americans than at any time in our history.  According to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, more than 70,000 people died in the United States from drug overdoses in 2017, making drug overdoses the leading cause of premature deaths in the country.  The vast majority of the illicit drugs responsible for these deaths originate outside the United States, placing drug supply and demand reduction among the most urgent U.S. foreign policy priorities.  Opioids continue to fuel the majority of U.S. overdose deaths.  What began as a prescription drug problem and morphed into a heroin epidemic has shifted to misuse of highly potent synthetic opioids, particularly fentanyl and its analogues.  Synthetic opioids are frequently laced into heroin and other drugs, or pressed into counterfeit pills and sold to often unsuspecting users, adding to the risk of overdose.  These shifts have resulted in a staggering loss of American lives in recent years.  Deaths from synthetic opioids, primarily fentanyl, soared to nearly 30,000 in 2017, up more than 45 percent from 2016.    Trafficking in these drugs offers numerous advantages to criminals.  Synthetic drugs can be manufactured virtually anywhere, and production costs are low.  The extreme potency of synthetic opioids lets traffickers reap high profits from small volumes.  Criminals exploit the tools of global e-commerce to sell these drugs online directly to consumers and, due to their potency, small quantities of drugs can be delivered through the mail and express consignment services at minimal risk of detection.  Virtually any community with a postal address and internet connectivity is at risk, and what began in North America has metastasized into what the United Nations now calls “a global opioid epidemic.”     Trafficking and abuse of synthetic opioids has become a top concern of governments across Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, particularly involving counterfeit or illicitly manufactured tramadol.  Within the European Union, over three dozen new synthetic opioids have been detected since 2009, with 13 reported in 2017, including 10 fentanyl analogues.  This expansion is likely to continue, as traffickers adapt to outmaneuver regulatory controls and law enforcement efforts as they seek new markets.    These are considerable challenges that will test the capacities, resourcefulness, and political will of the international community.  On September 24, 2018, President Trump launched the Global Call to Action on the World Drug Problem at the United Nations in New York City, where 130 countries committed to take further action to address and counter the world drug problem, including the emerging threat of synthetic drugs.  Policies and legal frameworks developed to meet the drug control challenges of the previous century may require adjustments for the 21st century.  The United States and many countries, for example, have enacted legal reforms to control new psychoactive substances (NPS) based on their psychoactive effects or chemical similarity to controlled drugs, rather than precise chemical structures.  In December 2018, China \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  16  committed to control fentanyl compounds as a class.  Once implemented, this move should help thwart illicit chemists and manufacturers who quickly change their illicit formulations to non-regulated analogues to evade law enforcement.  Effective global responses will need to target all vulnerabilities in the supply chain exploited by criminals, including online trafficking facilitated by virtual currencies and other emerging technologies.  Further steps must also be taken to safeguard the integrity of international mail and express consignment services from criminal misuse, including the collection and sharing of advance electronic data to help identify suspicious parcels.  The United States is committed to deploying the full range of its diplomatic, law enforcement, and foreign assistance tools to facilitate global action in these areas and, by doing so, to increase the cost, risk, and difficulties associated with trafficking and misusing synthetic opioids and other NPS.      While we adjust our posture to address these emerging 21st century threats, the United States will remain deeply engaged in working with partners to address traditional drug threats, particularly cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine, which continue to inflict a heavy toll in the United States and many countries around the world.  Experts from the United Nations and other organizations have warned that surging production, trafficking, and use of methamphetamine in some South East Asian countries has reached crisis proportions.  Coca cultivation and cocaine production remains at historically high levels in Colombia, fueling rising use and overdose deaths in the United States and threatening Colombia’s efforts to establish enduring peace and security throughout its territory.  Opium poppy cultivation and heroin production remain rampant in Afghanistan, undermining stability and economic development and fueling the Taliban insurgency and corruption.  In Mexico, powerful transnational criminal organizations continue to reap billions of dollars in profits from controlling trafficking routes for methamphetamine, heroin, fentanyl, and cocaine into the United States, increasing corruption and violence.     These are daunting challenges, and like-minded governments will need to continue working together in the years to come to reverse the tide.  Progress will also require further steps to reduce demand for illicit drugs, including through expanding access to evidence-based treatment and recovery programs, and improving programs to prevent illicit drug use before it begins.  The United States is committed to working through regional bodies, multilateral channels, and bilaterally with like-minded governments to promote coordinated international responses to address these challenges.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  17  Demand Reduction  Drug demand reduction is a key foreign policy tool for addressing the interconnected threats of drugs, crime, and violence.  The goal of demand reduction strategies calls for a comprehensive, balanced approach to the drug problem that targets prevention, treatment, recovery, research, and international cooperation.   Recognizing that substance use is a major public health threat, and that drug use is a preventable and treatable disease, many countries are requesting INL-sponsored technical assistance to improve and develop effective policies aimed at reducing use.  INL works closely with international partners to coordinate and execute capacity building and training activities for service providers in drug prevention, treatment, and recovery.  INL also promotes the sharing of critical information and evidence-based studies to preserve the stability of societies threatened by the drug trade.  The drug demand reduction program has four pillars: (1) develop the drug demand reduction workforce, (2) professionalize drug treatment, prevention, and recovery services, (3) build global networks and community coalitions, and (4) address populations with special clinical needs.  In achieving these objectives, INL supports the following: • Capacity building, training, mentoring, and credentialing aimed to educate governments, public organizations, and practitioners in the field on evidence-based practices in drug prevention, treatment and recovery; • Development of drug-free community coalitions internationally, involving law enforcement and public/private social institutions aimed at preventing drug use and its consequences; • Research, development, and outcome based evaluation efforts to determine the effectiveness of drug prevention and treatment programs; and  • Development of innovative tools to increase knowledge of and decrease deaths caused by toxic adulterants found in illicit substances.   Recognizing that there are populations with special clinical needs in the development and pattern of substance use disorders, INL supports technical assistance to address their unique treatment needs associated with substance use and related violence.    Significant completed and ongoing INL-funded demand reduction projects for 2018 include:  Universal Prevention Curriculum:  INL’s Universal Prevention Curriculum (UPC) consists of two series, one for coordinators/managers of prevention programs and one for prevention implementers/prevention workers.  This training program is based on the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Standards for Drug Use Prevention, offering innovative evidence-based approaches to drug prevention in a variety of settings such as family, school, workplace, media, and the community.  The development of examinations and an International Certified Prevention Specialist credential is in the process of being developed.  The effectiveness of the school-based program is currently being evaluated with INL support in collaboration with the Cayetano Heredia University in Lima, Peru. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  18   Regional Treatment Training:  INL supports the work of the Colombo Plan, UNODC, and the Organization of American States to strengthen the workforce providing drug prevention, treatment and recovery services through intensive trainings and credentialing examinations at the national level.  These trainings improve the quality of services, helping prevent the initiation of drug use and improving treatment outcomes, lowering relapse rates, and generating overall greater confidence in the treatment system.  Through 2018, the curriculum has been disseminated in 56 countries – Afghanistan, Bahamas, Bangladesh, Benin, Bhutan, Botswana, Cambodia, Cameroon, Cote d’Ivoire, Egypt, Estonia, Ethiopia, Fiji, Gambia, Georgia, Ghana, Guatemala, India, Indonesia, Iraq, Japan, Kazakhstan, Kenya, Kyrgyzstan, Laos, Liberia, Madagascar, Malaysia, Maldives, Mexico, Mongolia, Mozambique, Myanmar, Namibia, Nepal, Nigeria, Niger, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Samoa, Senegal, Seychelles, South Africa, South Korea, Sri Lanka, Tajikistan, Tanzania, Thailand, Togo, Tunisia, Turkmenistan, Uganda, United Arab Emirates, Uzbekistan and Vietnam.    Child Addiction Initiative:  INL is supporting the development of evidence-based training to establish effective and appropriate drug prevention and treatment practices to young children (aged 12 and under) exposed to drugs.  This initiative is in response to increasing reports of acute and growing substance use disorders among children in Asia, Africa and South America, where age-appropriate treatment may be unavailable or not scientifically sound.  Working with a panel of global child drug addiction experts, INL developed six child-focused psychosocial and pharmacological treatment training courses to serve as a tool to help strengthen international capacities in this field.  This program is being implemented through Colombo Plan and UNODC in collaboration with the University of North Carolina.  Women’s Drug Treatment Initiatives:  INL supports research-based prevention, treatment, and recovery programs in high-risk countries to improve services for addicted women and their children, a chronically under-served and stigmatized population.  In 2018, INL redesigned its Guiding the Recovery of Women (GROW) curriculum addressing the unique needs of women with substance use disorders across the globe.  The first course of four of the new curriculum Women’s Interventions for Substance Exposure (WISE) completed its pilot testing in December 2018 and will complete the remaining three courses in the spring of 2019 before it is peer reviewed and finalized.   Alternatives to Incarceration:  The United Nations Special Session on Drugs Outcome Document and the U.S.-sponsored CND resolution in 2016 called on countries to support alternatives to incarceration and proportionate sentencing, especially for drug dependent, nonviolent offenders.  Alternatives to incarceration – including an emphasis on gaining access to drug treatment and care – can occur before an arrest, at an initial court hearing, within the jail, at re-entry and through community corrections such as probation.  In 2018, INL supported the development of training for policymakers and agency heads from both the public health sector and criminal justice sector to discuss critical areas of need within a particular country related to alternatives to incarceration.  The course was pilot tested in Jamaica in October and will also be pilot tested in Guyana in 2019 before undergoing a peer review process and finalization.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  19  Intranasal Naloxone Feasibility Study:  In 2016, INL support to UNODC and the World Health Organization initiated a feasibility study (Stop Overdose Safely, or S-O-S) on community management of opioid overdoses, including the intranasal use of naloxone.  This study includes training for people likely to witness overdoses on how to correctly administer naloxone.  In 2018, training was provided for trainers and researchers from Ukraine, Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan, and Kazakhstan to prepare for country-wide roll outs of trainings and data collection.  Development of the International Consortium of Universities for Drug Demand Reduction (ICUDDR):  In June 2018, INL and a consortium of international organization partners and universities from around the world held its third ICUDDR meeting in partnership with San Diego University in San Diego, with participation from representatives of 32 universities from 24 countries.  The ICUDDR is a network of universities working together to promote academic programs in addition studies (drug prevention and treatment) to further the dissemination of evidence-based practices and develop the drug demand reduction workforce.  With INL support, ICUDDR membership grew by 565 percent in two years to 137 members in 47 countries.    Drug-Free Communities:  INL assists civil society and grassroots organizations to form and sustain effective community anti-drug coalitions aimed at preventing substance use disorders in their communities.  INL support has resulted in the establishment of over 280 active coalitions consisting of over 6,700 volunteers in 23 countries around the world (Argentina, Brazil, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Honduras, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, Uruguay, Cape Verde, Ghana, Kenya, Mauritius, Senegal, South Africa, Togo, Uganda, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Philippines, Indonesia, and Albania).    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  20  Methodology for U.S. Government Estimates of Illegal Drug Production  Introduction  Illicit drug crops are grown, refined into illegal drugs, trafficked, and sold on the street by criminal enterprises that attempt to conceal every step of the process.  Accurate estimates of such criminal activity are difficult to produce.  The estimates of illicit drug production presented in the INCSR represent the United States government’s best effort to assess the current dimensions of the international drug problem.  They are based on agricultural surveys conducted with satellite imagery and scientific studies of crop yields and the likely efficiency of typical illicit refining labs.  As we do every year, we publish these estimates with an important caveat: they are estimates.  While we must express our estimates as numbers, these numbers should not be seen as precise figures.  Rather, they represent the midpoint of a band of statistical probability that gets wider as additional variables are introduced and as we move from cultivation to harvest to final refined drug.   As needed, the United States government revises its estimate process and occasionally the estimates themselves – in the light of field research and technological advancements.  The clandestine, violent nature of the illegal drug trade makes field research difficult.  Geography is also an impediment, as the harsh terrain on which many drugs are cultivated is not always easily accessible.  This is particularly relevant given the tremendous geographic areas that must be covered and the difficulty of collecting reliable information over diverse and treacherous terrain.  Weather can affect our ability to gather data, particularly in the Andes, where cloud cover can be a major problem.    Improved technologies and analytical techniques may also lead us to produce revisions to United States government estimates of potential drug production.  This is typical of annualized figures for most other areas of statistical tracking that must be revised year to year.  When possible, we apply these new techniques to previous years’ data and adjust appropriately, but often, especially in the case of new technologies, we can only apply them prospectively.  These illicit drug statistics represent the current state of the art.  As new information and technology becomes applicable, the accuracy of the estimates will improve.  Cultivation Estimates  The Unites States government conserves limited personnel and technical resources by employing sample survey methodologies to estimate illicit crop cultivation and concentrating survey efforts on areas with strategic amounts of illegal cultivation or areas most likely to have illicit crop cultivation.  Each year, analysts review a variety of datasets – including eradication data, seizure data, law enforcement investigations information, previous field locations, and other information – to determine areas likely to have illegal cultivation, and revise and update the search area, if necessary.  They then survey and estimate cultivation in new areas using proven statistical techniques.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  21  The resulting estimates meet the U.S. government’s need for an annual estimate of illicit crop cultivation for each country.  They also help with eradication, interdiction, and other law enforcement operations.  As part of the effort to provide accurate and comprehensive assessments, the areas surveyed are often expanded and modified, so direct comparison with previous year estimates is sometimes not possible.    Production Estimates  Illicit crop productivity depends upon a number of factors.  Changes in weather, farming techniques, soil fertility, and disease prevalence can produce widely varying yields from year to year and place to place.  Some illicit drug crop areas are not easily accessible to the U.S. government, which can make scientific information difficult to obtain.  However, we continually strive to improve our drug production estimates.  The relative productivity of poppy crops in some cases can be estimated using imagery, and our confidence in coca leaf yield continues to improve as a result of field studies conducted in Latin America.  Coca fields which are less than 18 months of age (“new fields”) produce much less leaf than mature fields.  In Colombia, for example, fields on average get their first small harvest at six months of age; in Bolivia and Peru, fields are usually first harvested at 12 months of age.  The U.S. government estimates include the proportion of new fields detected each year and adjust leaf production accordingly.  Processing Estimates  The wide variation in processing efficiency achieved by narcotics producers complicates the task of accurately assessing the quantity of cocaine or heroin that could be refined from a crop.  Differences in the origin and quality of the raw material and chemicals used, the technical processing method employed, the size and sophistication of laboratories, the skill and experience of local workers and chemists, and decisions made in response to enforcement pressures all affect production.    The U.S. government estimates for coca leaf, cocaine, marijuana, opium, and heroin production are potential estimates; that is, it is assumed that all of the coca, cannabis, and poppy grown is harvested and processed into illicit drugs.  This is a reasonable assumption for coca leaf in Colombia.  In Bolivia and Peru, however, the U.S. government potential cocaine production estimates do not remove for coca leaf locally chewed and used in products such as coca tea.  In Southwest and Southeast Asia and Latin America, it is not unrealistic to assume that virtually all poppy is harvested for opium gum, but substantial amounts of Asian opium are consumed or stored rather than being processed into heroin; the proportion of this opium ultimately processed into heroin is unknown.  Other International Estimates  The United States helps fund estimates done by the United Nations in some countries.  These estimates use different methodologies from the U.S. government assessments and utilize a mix of imagery and ground-based observations.  The UN estimates are often used to help determine the response of the international donor community to specific countries or regions.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  22  There have been some efforts for the U.S. government and the UN to understand each other’s methodologies with the goal of improving both sets of estimates.  These efforts are ongoing.  This report also includes data on drug production, trafficking, seizures, and consumption that come from host governments or non-governmental organizations.  Such data is attributed to the source organization, especially when we cannot independently verify it.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1  Policy and Program Developments  23    2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 Opium*                   Afghanistan       5,300        3,200        4,400        4,300        5,500        6,300        4,100  5,800          9,140  Burma          305           530           450                 795      900           834      Colombia   22                          20  24 Guatemala        4  6              14               6  7 In Process  Laos              12            23             57                             91  Mexico                      250              220           225          360           600           685  944 Pakistan  26                          28  220            105           29           52  Potential Pure Heroin          Afghanistan 630 390 510 510 650 740 480 680 1,070 Burma 29 51 43  76 85  79  Colombia 3     3 3   Guatemala    .5 1 2 1 1 In Process Laos 1 2 6     9  Mexico   30 26 26 42 70 81 111 Pakistan 3   3 26 12 3 6  Total Potential L.

The Government of the United States of America notified the United Nations that it does not believe the “State of Palestine” qualifies as a sovereign state and does not recognize it as such.  Therefore, the Government of the United States of America believes that the “State of Palestine” is not qualified to accede to the Conventions and does not believe that it is in a treaty relationship with the “State of Palestine” under the Conventions.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  32       USG ASSISTANCE    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  33 U.S. Department of State FY 2018-2019 Budget   Counternarcotics Program Area      $ in thousands for all items   FY 2018 653(a)   FY 2019 Request   TOTAL   $                      386,954.00  $                293,311.00    Africa   $                            1,000.00   $                    1,300.00      Liberia   $                            1,000.00   $                   1,300.00    East Asia and Pacific   $                            4,200.00   $                   2,800.00      Burma   $                            1,100.00   $                   1,100.00      China  $                             1,200.00  $       Indonesia   $                               400.00   $                      300.00      Philippines   $                             1,500.00  $                   1,400.00    South and Central Asia   $                          69,997.00  $                 52,270.00     Afghanistan   $                          64,000.00  $                 43,740.00     Kazakhstan  $                                391.00  $       Pakistan   $                            2,000.00   $                  6,500.00      Tajikistan   $                               700.00  $                           Uzbekistan  $                               300.00  $      Central Asia Regional   $                            2,606.00  $                   2,030.00    Western Hemisphere   $                        232,718.00   $               181,075.00      Colombia   $                          103,500.00   $                 93,000.00      Mexico   $                          54,183.00   $                  36,000.00      Peru   $                          29,900.00   $                  24,900.00     State Western Hemisphere Regional (WHA)   $                          45,135.00   $                  27,175.00          of which, CARSI  $                          35,950.00  $                  20,750.00           of which, CBSI  $                           9,185.00  $                   6,425.00    INL - International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs   $                          79,039.00   $                  55,866.00     INL - CFSP, Critical Flight Safety Program   $                            5,402.00   $                    3,500.00     INL - Demand Reduction    $                          12,500.00   $                  10,000.00     INL – Drug Supply Reduction  $                           11,825.00  $      INL - Inter-regional Aviation Support   $                          34,577.00   $                  22,000.00     INL - International Organizations   $                            2,175.00   $                    4,075.00     INL - Program Development and Support   $                          12,560.00   $                  16,291.00    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  34 International Training  International counternarcotics training is managed and funded by the U.S. Department of State’s Bureau of International Narcotics and Law Enforcement Affairs (INL), and implemented by various U.S. law enforcement organizations including the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), U.S. Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and U.S. Coast Guard.  Major objectives are:  •  Contributing to enhanced professionalism of the basic rule of law infrastructure for carrying out counternarcotics law enforcement activities in countries which cooperate with and are considered significant to U.S. narcotics control efforts;  •  Improving technical skills of drug law enforcement personnel in these countries; and  •  Increasing cooperation between U.S. and foreign law enforcement officials.  INL-funded training supports U.S. counternarcotics priorities worldwide, and focuses on encouraging foreign law enforcement agency self-sufficiency.  The overarching goal of U.S. counternarcotics training is to support the development of effective host country enforcement institutions, capable of removing drugs from circulation before they can reach the United States.  U.S training can take two forms: as part of a planned bilateral assistance program in target partner countries; and as regional training with international participants from multiple countries.  The regional training provided at International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) consists of both general law enforcement training as well as specialized training for mid-level managers in police and other law enforcement agencies.  U.S. bilateral training assistance program works closely with international organizations including the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Organization of American States.  The United States coordinates assistance planning with other donors through mechanisms such as the Dublin Group (an informal body of countries and organizations that provide law enforcement training), and the Paris Pact (an informal network of states dedicated to stopping the spread of Afghan opiates).  The United States continuously works to promote burden-sharing with our allies in the provision of training, as well as ensuring that our respective efforts are complementary and directed towards common goals.  International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs)  The International Law Enforcement Academies (ILEAs) pursue three core objectives:  building the capacity of foreign criminal justice partners of the United States to stop crime before it impacts the United States; fostering partnerships across national borders within important regions of the world; and advancing partner nations’ engagement with U.S. law enforcement agencies.  These academies are an important part of the interagency U.S. effort to combat transnational criminal organizations.     Since the first ILEA opened in Budapest in 1995, the program has grown to six facilities worldwide, and has provided training to approximately 70,000 students in from countries in \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  35 Africa, Europe, Asia, and across Latin America.  The ILEA program hosts approximately 150 courses per year.  The program implements a number of key programming initiatives including an anti-corruption course series, courses focused on countering violent extremism, and executive-level symposiums on combating transnational criminal organizations.  Training includes specialized skill development and tactics in law enforcement areas such as counternarcotics; investigating money laundering and financial crimes; cybercrime investigations; border control; and countering all forms of trafficking including weapons, wildlife, and trafficking in persons.  ILEA also works with senior officers and administrators on principles of leadership and effective management at ILEA Roswell.  The ILEAs help to develop an extensive network of alumni who exchange information with their regional and U.S. counterparts and assist in transnational investigations.  Many ILEA graduates become the leaders and decision-makers in their respective law enforcement organizations.  The Department of State coordinates with the Departments of Justice, Homeland Security and Treasury, and with foreign government counterparts to implement the ILEA program.  Africa.  ILEA Gaborone (Botswana) opened in 2001 and the Regional Training Center in Accra (Ghana) opened in 2012.  ILEA Gaborone delivers one multi-week leadership and development course annually and also specialized courses for police and other criminal justice officials to boost their capacity to work with U.S. and regional counterparts.  These courses concentrate on specific methods and techniques in a variety of subjects, such as anticorruption, financial crimes, border security, crime scene investigations, counternarcotics, explosives, trafficking in weapons and wildlife, gender-based violence, and community policing.  A Regional Training Center is operated in Accra, Ghana, in coordination with the ILEA, and addresses the unique needs of the West African region.  ILEA Gaborone and RTC Accra provided training to approximately 2,015 students in 2018.  Asia.  ILEA Bangkok (Thailand) opened in 1999, and focuses on enhancing regional cooperation against transnational crime threats in Southeast Asia with ASEAN member states.  ILEA Bangkok’s specialized courses focus on counternarcotics, anticorruption, financial crimes, environmental crimes, and trafficking in persons, weapons, and wildlife ILEA Bangkok trained approximately 1,107 students in 2018.  Europe.  ILEA Budapest (Hungary) was the first ILEA and was established in 1995.  ILEA Budapest delivers three  multi-week leadership and development courses annually and also offers specialized courses on regional threats such as anticorruption, organized crime, cybercrime, financial crimes, women in law enforcement, gender-based violence, and  specialized training for judges and prosecutors.  ILEA Budapest trained approximately 1,060 students in 2018.  Global.  ILEA Roswell (New Mexico) opened in September 2001.  ILEA Roswell hosts senior officials and policy makers including top prosecutors, judges, police commanders and lawmakers to discuss policy formulation and enforcement to facilitate an effective criminal justice system in these priority areas.  These delegates are at the senior levels of leadership in their countries, and are positioned to implement substantive changes to the criminal justice systems upon their return.  ILEA Roswell draws senior officials from all participating ILEA countries.  ILEA Roswell trained approximately 324 students in 2018.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  36 Latin America.  ILEA San Salvador (El Salvador) opened in 2005.  ILEA San Salvador delivers two multi-week leadership and development courses annually and also offers specialized courses on regional threats, as well as specialized courses for police, prosecutors, and judicial officials.  ILEA San Salvador courses concentrate on anti-gangs, human rights, counternarcotics, border security, and financial crimes.  ILEA San Salvador trained approximately 1,154 students in 2018.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  37 Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)   The mission of the DEA is to enforce the controlled substances laws and regulations of the United States.  As part of this mission, DEA seeks to bring to justice the criminal organizations and principal members of Drug Trafficking Organizations (DTOs) based in the United States or foreign nations involved in the cultivation, manufacture, or distribution of controlled substances, as well as the money laundering of illicit finances derived from drug trafficking.   To achieve this mission, DEA has nearly 10 percent of its Special Agent and Intelligence Analyst work force permanently assigned overseas at 90 DEA foreign offices located in 69 countries.  DEA’s foreign offices act as conduits of actionable and strategic information, intelligence, and evidence to law enforcement and prosecutorial components in the United States and vice versa.  In this manner, DEA is able to identify, target, and dismantle the entire global spectrum of the DTO.  DEA foreign offices are tasked with four principle missions:   • Conduct bilateral and multilateral investigations with host law enforcement partners;  • Coordinate counternarcotics intelligence gathering with host governments;  • Implement training programs for host country police and prosecutor agencies;  • Support the advancement and development of host country drug law enforcement institutions.  The emphasis placed on each objective is determined by the host nation’s unique conditions and circumstances as it relates to their drug trafficking threat, infrastructure and law enforcement capabilities.  DEA works side-by-side with host nation counterparts to develop relevant training, promote intelligence sharing, conduct bilateral investigations, and support joint counter-drug operations.  The vast majority of DEA foreign efforts and resources are dedicated to conducting international drug and drug money laundering investigations.  In addition to that mandate, in 2018 DEA dedicated considerable effort in the fields of training, multinational law enforcement collaboration, and forensic science.  International Training:  In Fiscal Year 2018, DEA Training Division conducted 81 formal (bilateral) and multilateral seminars for 2,628 participants from 73 countries.  DEA has been conducting international counter-narcotics training since its creation in 1973.  DEA is recognized as the world pioneer in international training and serves as the model for a variety of international law enforcement training efforts.  The specific courses and curricula offered by DEA have evolved over the years in response to experience, changes in law enforcement priorities, current international narcotics trafficking situations, new technologies, and specific requests of the host governments.  All DEA international training programs have as a major objective the building of regional working relationships between countries.  International Drug Enforcement Conference (IDEC) - Strengthening International Relations:  In 1983, IDEC was established to institutionalize regional cooperation of drug law enforcement officials from countries within the Western Hemisphere.  Over the years IDEC has evolved into an important global forum where the highest ranking agency leaders and prosecutors from around 125 countries gather to develop a cooperative vision and establish strategies for \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  38 combating DTOs.  Participants continue to build, balance, and integrate the tools of law enforcement power to combat these criminal networks and build a framework for international cooperation to protect all our citizens from the violence, harm, and exploitation wrought by drug trafficking and commensurate threats to national security.  IDEC is an operational targeting opportunity and global forum for important topical issues in international drug enforcement, and to identify and attack DTO vulnerabilities.  IDEC initiatives have demonstrated that a multilateral enforcement approach has a cumulative effect as member nations increasingly coordinate their law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute major DTOs and their leaders and to seize and block their assets.  The 36th annual IDEC is scheduled for April 2019 in Baku, Azerbaijan, where it will be co-hosted by the Republic of Azerbaijan government and DEA.  The Special Testing and Research Laboratory’s Programs:  The Heroin and Cocaine Signature Programs (HSP/CSP) at the DEA Special Testing and Research Laboratory (STRL) determine the geographic origins of heroin and cocaine seizure samples.  In addition, the laboratory maintains a Methamphetamine Profiling Program (MPP) that determines the synthetic routes and precursors employed in producing methamphetamine.  The classification schemes for these programs were developed using authentic samples collected from drug source countries world-wide, as well as drug processing laboratories within those countries.  By collaborating with partner nations, numerous such “authentics” are submitted annually to the laboratory from the DEA foreign offices.  Currently, the laboratory classifies several thousand drug exhibits seized within the United States and abroad annually.    The Signature and Profiling Programs provide the counterdrug intelligence community with science-based heroin and cocaine source data and intelligence information regarding methamphetamine synthesis.  The HSP, CSP, and the MPP are viewed as crucial tools to investigate and support strategic intelligence regarding illicit production, trafficking, and availability of these three high profile drugs within the United States and foreign countries.  Over the past several years, the laboratory has established a robust Emerging Trends Program to analyze new psychoactive substances for enforcement and intelligence purposes.  This group has identified over 400 synthetic cannabinoids, substituted cathinones, opioids and powerful hallucinogenic compounds that have come into the drug market.    To assist with addressing the nation’s current opioid crisis, STRL developed and implemented a new Fentanyl Signature Profiling Program (FSPP).  Through an in-depth analysis including quantitation, impurity profiling, isotopic characterization, and occluded solvents analysis, the FSPP provides unique science-based forensic investigative leads on seizures where linkages were unknown or only suspected; real-time data to investigators; answers to key questions from the counterdrug intelligence/enforcement community and U.S. policymakers; and direct support to the National Drug Control Strategy.  Since its inception, this program has established 36 linkages involving 65 cases and 152 samples from DEA seizures of 250 kilograms of fentanyl.   Office of Global Enforcement/Financial Investigations (OGF):  The Office of Global Enforcement, Financial Investigations Section (OGF) at DEA Headquarters serves as DEA’s lead body for coordinating DEA’s efforts across domestic and foreign offices with respect to the targeting of the financial aspects of drug trafficking organizations (DTO).  OGF works in \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  39 conjunction with DEA field offices, foreign counterparts, and the inter-agencies to support and provided guidance in via a variety of investigative tools, as well as by providing oversight on DEA’s undercover financial investigation.  OGF facilitates cooperation between countries, resulting in the identification and prosecution of money laundering organizations operating on behalf of DTOs, as well as the seizure of assets and denial of revenue around the world.  OGF regularly briefs and educates United States government officials and diplomats, foreign government officials, and military and law enforcement counterparts regarding the latest trends in money laundering, narcoterrorism financing, international banking, offshore corporations, international wire transfer of funds, and financial investigative tools.     In conjunction with the DEA Office of International Training, OGF conducts training for DEA field offices, as well as foreign counterparts in order to share strategic ideas and promote effective techniques in financial investigations.  During 2018, OGF participated and led a number of workshops and strategy sessions focused on money laundering trends, engagement with financial institutions, guidance and overview on undercover money laundering operations, virtual currency, and investigative case coordination.  DEA has prioritized having a financial component to its investigations by making it a key component of Priority Target Operations, the Domestic Cartel Initiative, and Organized Crime Drug Enforcement Task Force investigations.  DEA has approximately 20 dedicated financial investigative teams across DEA’s domestic offices, as well as approximately three foreign-based DEA team in Mexico, Peru, and Colombia.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  40 United States Coast Guard (USCG)  The U.S. Coast Guard plays a crucial role in efforts to keep dangerous illict drugs moving by sea from reaching the United States.  Working within the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) in carrying out its responsibilities within the National Drug Control Strategy, the USCG maintains a multi-faceted, layered approach to attack Transnational Organized Crime (TOC) networks and their transport of illicit contraband from South America toward the United States via the Caribbean Sea, the Eastern Pacific Ocean, and through the littorals of Central America and Mexico.  The overarching strategy is to increase maritime border security through a layered offensive system that extends beyond U.S. land borders to attack the networks responsible for smuggling drugs.  This system begins overseas, spans the offshore regions, and continues into U.S. territorial seas and ports.  The USCG’s mix of cutters, aircraft, boats, and deployable specialized forces, as well as international and domestic partnerships, allow the Coast Guard to leverage its unique maritime law enforcement authorities and competencies to address threats and improve security throughout the maritime domain.  USCG efforts focus on removing illicit drugs close to their origins and as far from U.S. shores as possible where drug shipments are in their most concentrated bulk form.  Moreover, these illicit cargoes are most vulnerable while in transit at sea through international waters where interdiction forces have the highest tactical advantage and best opportunity to interdict drug movements.  The next step in the maturation of maritime law enforcement is conducting operations to disrupt and dismantle the TOC networks by targeting any illicit activity in which they are engaged, to include drug, migrant, weapons and bulk cash smuggling, human trafficking, and illegal, unreported, or unregulated fishing.  Counternarcotics Operations:  Detection of drug-trafficking vessels occurs principally through the collection, analysis, and dissemination of tactical information and strategic intelligence combined with effective sensors operating from land, air, and surface assets.  The six million square mile transit zone is far too expansive to randomly patrol; targeting information is necessary to focus efforts.  Upon detection, U.S. and partner nation law enforcement agencies provide monitoring, relaying data, imagery, and position information until an appropriate interdiction asset arrives on scene.  The U.S. Coast Guard is the lead U.S. federal agency for drug interdiction on the high seas and takes tactical control of U.S. and allied assets for the interdiction and apprehension operational phase.  A crucial ingredient for continued maritime drug interdiction success is the USCG’s counterdrug bilateral agreements and operational procedures held with over 40 partner nations.  By facilitating operational communications and enabling law enforcement officers to stop, board, and search vessels suspected of illicit maritime activity, these agreements deter smugglers from using another nation’s vessel and/or territorial seas as a haven from U.S. law enforcement efforts.  International Cooperative Efforts:  In 2018, the USCG had personnel permanently assigned overseas as Coast Guard Liaison Officers, Defense Attachés, and Support to Interdiction and Prosecution team members to facilitate maritime counterdrug activities, including security assistance, intelligence collection and dissemination, and to liaise with the U.S. interagency and international community.  The USCG, in concert with the U.S. Department of State, hosts three counter drug summits per year: an annual Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  41 Summit (Caribbean) and two semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits (Central and South America).  These summits have a combined annual attendance of more than 35 countries, over 60 international agencies, and more than 300 experts.  Topics include maritime interdiction, prosecution, criminal investigations, and improving regional success in all aspects of the interdiction continuum.  To counter trans-Atlantic drug flows, the USCG continues to work with U.S. Africa Command to expand maritime training and operations for West African countries through the African Maritime Law Enforcement Partnership.   International Training and Technical Assistance:  The USCG provides international training and technical assistance to enhance the interdiction capacities of international partners.  The Technical Assistance Field Team, a joint initiative between the USCG and the U.S. Southern Command (SOUTHCOM), is a team of nine Coast Guard engineers and logisticians whose purpose is to professionalize and improve the operational readiness of 11 Caribbean maritime forces through technical assistance visits.  The USCG’s Security Assistance Program offers both resident training programs and mobile training teams (MTTs) to partner nation maritime services around the world to advance the capability of their naval and coast guard forces.  In Fiscal Year 2018, the USCG deployed 55 MTTs to 26 countries, and approximately 297 students from 64 countries attended 297 resident courses at USCG training installations.   Operational Highlights:  In Fiscal Year 2018, the USCG expended over 2,400 cutter days, over 1,400 Airborne Use of Force capable helicopters days, and over 3,400 surveillance aircraft hours on counter drug patrols, and USCG Law Enforcement Detachments deployed for over 600 days aboard U.S. Navy, British, Dutch, and Canadian warships.  As a result, the USCG disrupted 222 drug smuggling attempts, which included the seizure of 160 vessels, detention of 602 suspected smugglers for further investigation and prosecution, and removal of 209.6 metric tons (MT) of cocaine and 24.4 MT of marijuana.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  42 U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)  The Department of Homeland Security’s U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) processes all goods, vehicles, and people entering and exiting the United States.  CBP officers are charged with identification and prevention of terrorist travel to the United States and interception of illicit drugs and other contraband, improperly classified merchandise, unlicensed technology and material, weapons, ammunition, fugitives, undocumented immigrants, and unreported currency at America’s 329 international ports of entry (POEs).  United States Border Patrol (USBP) agents are assigned the mission of securing the border against all threats between the POEs along the over 8,000 miles of land and coastal border.  These threats include criminal/undocumented aliens, drug smugglers, potential terrorists, wanted criminals, and persons seeking to avoid inspection at the designated POEs.  CBP’s drug interdiction activity includes staffing 35 permanent and 140 tactical checkpoints nationwide.  CBP checkpoints utilize experienced agents, canine teams, technology, and shipper-CBP partnerships to detect and apprehend the above mentioned threats.  Additionally, agents patrol targeted border areas that are frequent entry points for the smuggling of drugs and people into the Unites States.  Since its creation, CBP has also been charged with the border regulatory functions of passport control and agriculture inspections in order to provide comprehensive, seamless border control services.  This merger of responsibilities is intended to simplify border security operations and is termed: \"One face at the border.\"  CBP is the nation’s first line of defense against the introduction of dangerous drugs from foreign sources.  U.S. Customs and Border Protection's (CBP) Air and Marine Operations (AMO) is a critical component of CBP's risk-based and layered approach for border security, with 1,300 federal agents, 248 aircraft, and 331 marine vessels operating throughout the United States and Puerto Rico.  AMO interdicts unlawful people and cargo approaching U.S. borders, investigates criminal networks and provides domain awareness in the air and maritime environments, and responds to contingencies and national taskings.    International Training and Assistance:  As part of its efforts to extend the nation’s zone of security beyond U.S. ports of entry, CBP works with other U.S. government and foreign government partners to provide a wide array of short-term and long-term technical training and assistance to countries throughout the world in conjunction with the Department of State, as appropriate.  These programs are designed to standardize and build the capacity of foreign government organizations to implement more effective customs trade operations, border policing, and immigration inspection.    International Visitors Program:  The State Department’s International Visitors Program can provide an opportunity for foreign customs officials and other foreign officials to consult with their U.S. counterparts and appropriate high-level managers in CBP Headquarters.  International visitors can also participate in on-site tours of selected U.S. ports and field sites to observe actual CBP operations.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  43 Port of Entry Interdiction Training:  The correct approach to border interdiction varies with border environments, e.g., land, seaport, rail, and airport.  Training are designed for the problems encountered and interdiction techniques useful for each type of operation.  CBP also provides specialized U.S. Border Patrol training in techniques used by smugglers who do not use official ports of entry to cross borders, but who attempt to smuggle contraband in lightly patrolled border areas.  International Bulk Currency Smuggling Training:  With an increased enforcement focus on money laundering, organized criminals and terrorists have turned to bulk cash smuggling to move valuables across borders.  Bulk Currency Smuggling training assists foreign government enforcement personnel in identifying techniques used by bulk currency smugglers.  Further, CBP training helps international partners to design and implement programs to counter that threat, resulting in seizures of millions of dollars from the proceeds of crime.  Overseas Enforcement Training:  Overseas Enforcement Training encompasses a curriculum which includes Border Enforcement Training; Supply Chain Security; Detection, Interdiction and Investigation; Concealment Methods; Bulk Currency Smuggling; False and Fraudulent Documents; Train-the-Trainer; Anti-Corruption; Targeting and Risk Management; Hazardous Materials; and X-ray Systems.  These courses can also be conducted at foreign ports of entry.  They include both basic training and refresher training/mentoring abroad for graduates of training at U.S. port facilities.    CBP Attachés, Representatives and Advisors and Special Customs’ Programs:  A growing network of attachés, representatives and advisors who serve in U.S. diplomatic missions, U.S. military bases, or directly for foreign border security agencies.  Attachés have a broad mandate, including enforcement and investigative activities on behalf of CBP.  They also exchange expert information with foreign counterparts, improving the effectiveness of law enforcement activity, policies, and resources relating to border enforcement.  Their efforts help to ensure that enforcement cooperation is seamless across borders and that the battle against illegal transnational activity is effective.  Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements:  CBP and U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) co-lead negotiations on Customs Mutual Assistance Agreements (CMAAs).  CMAAs are negotiated with foreign governments and provide for mutual assistance in the enforcement of customs-related laws.  Under the provisions of CMAAs, CBP provides assistance to its foreign counterparts and receives reciprocal assistance from them primarily in the exchange of information that facilitates the enforcement of each country’s laws.  As of the end of Fiscal Year 2017, the United States had signed 80 CMAAs, with three signed during Fiscal Year 2017.  CMAAs also provide a foundational basis for the development and implementation of other subsequent cooperation-based arrangements with foreign partners, especially as it relates initiatives that require information sharing and protections related thereto.    CBP Preclearance Field Office:  Preclearance operations involve the strategic stationing of CBP law enforcement personnel overseas to inspect travelers prior to boarding U.S.-bound flights.  Through preclearance, CBP Officers conduct the same immigration, customs, and agriculture inspections of international air travelers typically performed upon arrival in the \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     USG Assistance  44 United States before departure from foreign airports.  CBP has more than 600 law enforcement officers and agriculture specialists stationed at 15 air preclearance locations in six countries.  The aviation security benefits of preclearance are substantial because a uniformed, U.S. law enforcement officer interviews the precleared passenger before he or she boards the plane.  This added security layer provides an additional opportunity to detect and stop threats as early in the process as possible.  In addition to enhancing security, preclearance has the potential to increase capacity and create growth opportunities for airports and air carriers in the United States and abroad, while improving the passenger experience.  Preclearance generates the potential for significant economic benefits for the United States and our international partners by facilitating travel through all gateways, creating an overall increase in clearance capacity, and maximizing aircraft and gate utilization.  For travelers, preclearance leads to faster connections and the ability to exit the airport immediately upon landing the United States.  National Targeting Center:  The National Targeting Center (NTC) collaborates with international partners to identify, disrupt, and manage risks in the cargo and passenger environments through information sharing and implementing joint targeting operations in accordance with memoranda of understanding and CMAAs.  As part of this collaboration, the Center hosts representatives from participating foreign agencies, and works with these international liaisons, as well as with other U.S. government agencies, to detect and disrupt terrorism, threats to national security and public safety, and transnational criminal activity including but not limited to drug smuggling operations and drug trafficking organizations and their associates.  The NTC also provides training and technical assistance in risk assessment and targeting to foreign Customs, Immigration and other border enforcement agencies.    DOD Preclearance:  The Customs Border Clearance Agent (CBCA) program is designed to permit cargo consigned to the care of the Department of Defense (DoD), as well as returning military personnel, to be pre-cleared for import/entry into the Customs Territory of the United States.  The preclearance of such cargo and personnel is accomplished by DoD personnel that have been trained by CBP officers to perform pre-clearance inspections.  CBCA personnel conduct Customs and Agricultural inspections and certify personnel and cargo have met all CBP and USDA entry requirements, as well as Defense Travel Regulations, prior to departing to the U.S.  CBCA inspections are conducted at 28 locations in seven foreign countries throughout the Middle East. CBP officers also provide Technical Assistance Visits and annual Site Inspections/Certifications at these DoD preclearance facilities.   Immigration Advisory Program:  Immigration Advisory Program (IAP) works with air carriers and host authorities, at foreign airports, to prevent terrorists and other high-risk passengers from boarding U.S.-bound flights.  CBP’s Joint Security Program (JSP) is a component of the IAP with the goal of identifying high-risk air travelers and contraband arriving and departing the host country.  In 2014, IAP and JSP expanded to include the deployment of Police Liaison Officers (LO) to foreign partner law enforcement agencies to enhance information exchange posed by terrorist and criminal travel.  IAP, JSP and LO play a central role in CBP’s multi-layered strategy to mitigate threats before they reach the United States.  IAP currently operates in 20 distinct engagements across the globe. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  45        CHEMICAL CONTROLS   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  46  Introduction   Chemicals play two critical roles in the production of illicit drugs: as chemical inputs for the production of synthetic drugs such as methamphetamine and fentanyl; and as refining agents and solvents for processing plant-based materials such as coca and opium poppy into cocaine and heroin.  Preventing criminals from gaining access to chemicals needed to produce illicit drugs is a key international obligation codified by the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances of 1988 (1988 UN Drug Convention), and an enduring challenge.  This challenge has taken on new importance in recent years, corresponding to the growing threat of synthetic opioids and synthetic drug analogues known as new psychoactive substances (NPS).  Comprehensive efforts to prevent chemical diversion require strong national efforts to control the production, transport, sale, and storage of these substances, as well as international coordination and information sharing between governments and cooperation from private industry.    Some of the most widely-known chemicals used to produce plant-based drugs include potassium permanganate (used to produce cocaine) and acetic anhydride (used to produce heroin).  Preventing diversion of such chemicals depend on how nations improve their internal controls and take the initiative to join international regulatory efforts such as the ones managed by the International Narcotics Control Board (INCB).  The international community recognizes adherence to international regulatory efforts as an essential commitment to improve efforts against diversions of chemicals used to produce plant-based drugs.     Some illicit drug production methods have remained relatively constant through the years, involving the same common chemicals, particularly those used to refine traditional plant-based drugs such as cocaine and heroin.  Chemicals used as key ingredients to produce synthetic drugs and NPS have shifted more regularly.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has identified over 850 different forms of NPS and estimate the number of potential fentanyl analogues alone to number in the thousands.  Innovations in synthetic drug design and production continue to accelerate as drug producers seek to evade drug controls and tailor products to meet evolving consumer demand.  Sustained cooperation and expanded information sharing both within and between national governments is critical to keep pace with emerging trends in this field.  In March 2017, the 60th session of the United Nations Commission on Narcotic Drugs (CND) decided unanimously, at the request of the United States, to require all state parties to the 1988 UN Drug Convention to control the two key precursor chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl: 4-anilino-N-phenethylpiperidine (ANPP) and N-phenethyl-4-piperidone (NPP).  This binding international obligation went into effect in October 2017, and serves as a prime example of how the international drug control system should swiftly react to emerging drug control challenges and threats to public health, and to take concrete action to save lives, when quickly and properly applied.    In March 2018, at the 61st CND, the United States introduced a resolution focusing on the non-medical use of synthetic opioids and their precursors, including fentanyl and its analogues.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  47  Specifically, the U.S. resolution, which the CND ultimately adopted by consensus, promotes expanded use of existing tools developed by UNODC and INCB that facilitate real-time cooperation between international law enforcement partners to disrupt the illicit supply chain of these dangerous precursors.  The International Framework  The 1988 UN Drug Convention is the legal framework for international cooperation to prevent precursor chemical diversion.  Specifically, the 190 UN member states that are party to the convention are required, under Article 12, to monitor their international trade in the chemicals listed in Tables I and II of the Convention.  These chemicals have legitimate industrial uses and the tables are updated regularly to account for changes in the manufacture of illicit drugs.  State parties are required to share information with one another and with the INCB on their international transactions involving these chemicals to identify and prevent diversion for illicit purposes.  Article 12, Sections 8 and 9 of the Convention requires licensing or similar control of all persons and enterprises involved in the manufacture and distribution of listed chemicals.    Resolutions from the CND – the treaty-based body within the UN system with prime responsibility for international drug-control policy – have provided additional guidance to states parties on how to implement their obligations according to specific best practices.  These resolutions have also encouraged greater dissemination and use of the INCB’s International Special Surveillance List (ISSL) – a mechanism for monitoring chemicals not regulated by the Convention but for which substantial evidence exists of their use in illicit drug manufacture.    The INCB is an independent, quasi-judicial monitoring body for the implementation of the three UN international drug control conventions – the 1988 UN Drug Convention, the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs of 1961 as amended by the 1972 Protocol, and the Convention on Psychotropic Substances of 1971.  The INCB monitors compliance with the drug control treaties and proposes appropriate remedial measures and technical assistance to governments that are not fully applying the provisions of the treaties or are encountering difficulties in applying them.  The United States provides funding to the INCB to monitor the measures called for in the Conventions, and to improve detection and tracking of chemicals subject to diversion.  In addition to ISSL, the INCB has developed a number of instruments to address the challenges of precursor chemicals:  • The Pre-Export Notification Online system (PEN Online) is an online database system that enables the exchange of information between member states on the import and export of chemicals required for the manufacture of illicit drugs, and to provide the ability to raise alerts to stop suspect shipments before they reach illicit drug manufacturers.  The system facilitates information sharing on the global level by collecting data on precursor chemical trafficking and use trends, and then publicizing this data.  In practice, electronic responses are sent to exporting countries which are required to acknowledge receipt and confirm clearance to export chemicals.  Since the PEN Online system was first launched in March 2006, 162 governments have registered to use it.  On average, there are 2,910 PEN pre-export notifications made monthly via \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  48  the online system.  More than 35,000 pre-export notifications have been submitted using the PEN Online system.  • The Precursors Incident Communication System (PICS) is another INCB tool that facilitates real-time communication exchange among law enforcement officials worldwide.  The system supports intelligence sharing and facilitates direct coordination and collaboration among national authorities to advance investigations on chemical trafficking.  As of November 2018, more than 2,300 incidents communicated through PICS; an increase of more than 230 from the previous year.  Those incidents involved more than 30 different countries and territories.  The system has registered users from 109 countries and territories, representing nearly 250 agencies.    In addition to PEN Online and PICS, the INCB manages task forces to implement Project Prism, Project Cohesion, and Project ION — three INCB international initiatives in matters related to chemicals used in the illicit manufacture of drugs, specifically synthetic drugs (Project Prism), heroin and cocaine (Project Cohesion), and NPS (Project ION).  These ongoing mechanisms facilitate coordinating the monitoring of chemical transactions and targeted, time-bound intelligence-gathering operations.    The Board also maintains a Precursor Task Force and a Project ION Task Force.  At the 61st CND, the Precursor Task Force held a side event delivering presentations on flexible approaches to drug precursor control.  Those included examples of voluntary cooperation with industry in Germany; regulatory measures in the United States to reduce administrative burdens on control measures; and steps to cope with non-scheduled precursor chemicals in China.  The Project ION Task Force is primarily engaged in the coordination, collection, and communication of strategic and operational information and intelligence related to synthetic NPS with little or no known medical, scientific, or industrial uses.  This task force promotes international operational initiatives by supporting national authorities' efforts in preventing non-scheduled NPS from reaching consumer markets.  Additionally, the INCB recently implemented a special project (Project Opioids) to interdict the illicit distribution and sales of synthetic opioids by developing partnerships and practical actions with governments and relevant industries.    Regional Bodies.  The regulatory framework codified by the United Nations does  not exist in isolation.  Regional bodies, such as the European Union (EU) and the Organization of American States (OAS) actively work in partnership with the United States on multilateral chemical control initiatives, including the implementation of CND resolutions.  Chemical Control Activities and New Trends  Fentanyl.  Fentanyl is a powerful and deadly Schedule II synthetic opioid that is between 50 and 100 times more potent than morphine.  Within North America, drug traffickers are increasingly lacing illicit fentanyl into heroin and other drugs to create a more potent high for users.  Fentanyl is also pressed into pill form and sold as counterfeit prescription opioid pills.  In many instances, buyers are not aware of the presence of fentanyl in heroin, alternatively the user may have sought out fentanyl-laced heroin for the greater high.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  49  Fentanyl is responsible for a surging number of overdose fatalities in the United States, Canada, and some European countries.  Specifically in the United States between 2017 and 2018, fentanyl-related overdose claimed the lives of more than 30,000 Americans.  In Canada, from January to June 2018, opioids, mainly fentanyl and its analogues, were responsible for nearly 2,100 overdose deaths.  While fentanyl deaths have been highest in North America, fentanyl availability and overdose deaths have also increased in other parts of the world.  In the United Kingdom, 122 fentanyl-related deaths were recorded from between 2017 and March 2018, up from 58 recorded in 2016.    The two precursor chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related substances (for example, acetyl fentanyl) are NNPP and ANPP.  While there are several chemicals and pathways to manufacture fentanyl, the NPP and ANPP processing method is currently the preferred one used by clandestine manufacturers.  On October 18, 2017, these two chemicals were added to Table I (internationally controlled chemicals) of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, implementing the decision of the 2017 CND.  With the addition of ANPP and NPP, there are now 28 chemicals controlled under Table I.  International control of these chemicals under the 1988 UN Drug Convention requires states parties to the convention to institute domestic regulation of the import and export of ANPP and NPP, which is intended to reduce their availability to criminals and reduce their availability in the illicit supply chain.    The INCB has identified a list of 93 fentanyl-related substances with no currently known legitimate medical or industrial uses, beyond limited research and analytical purposes.  Seventy-seven of those substances are not currently scheduled under any of the three UN drug conventions.  In response to Member State requests, the Board disseminated this list of fentanyl-related substances and invited all countries to refrain on a voluntary basis from any manufacture, import, export or distribution of the substances on the list.  The list is a valuable tool used by DEA and international law enforcement practitioners to increase identification and detection of fentanyl-related substances in criminal channels.  New Psychoactive Substances and Opioid Analogues.  NPS are substances of abuse, either in a pure form or a preparation, that are not controlled by the 1961 Convention or the 1971 Convention, but which may pose a public health threat.  Producers modify and experiment with new chemical formulas in a search for new NPS that can avoid detection by authorities and skirt the international control regime.    The rapid proliferation of NPS is creating a critical challenge for law enforcement officials worldwide because of the speed in which they can be reformulated and remarketed to avoid international control.  Over 850 formulations of NPS were reported to the United Nations through 2018, exceeding the capacity of law enforcement and regulatory authorities to curb this problem.  Traffickers sell these substances via the Internet, through both open and non-indexed online websites (the so-called “Dark Web”), then utilize international mail and express consignment shipments to deliver them.  Because of the extreme potency of these substances, tiny quantities, often only milligrams, are required to generate powerful and deadly highs; consequently, such small shipments can easily evade law enforcement and regulatory detection.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  50  The UNODC’s Global Synthetics, Monitoring Analyses, Reporting and Trends (SMART) program helps law enforcement and forensic officials to combat the challenges posed by NPS through increased information sharing worldwide.  The United States is a staunch supporter of the Global SMART program as a critical tool to increase voluntary cooperation among member states in sharing information on NPS trafficking and use trends on a global level.  Data collected and analyzed by Global SMART informs CND scheduling decisions that affect international control of NPS under the UN drug conventions.  This information is available on online portals, and is used to generate reports updating member states on the scope of this problem.    Illicit manufacture, trafficking, and use of synthetic opioids and NPS are poised to expand to new countries and regions.  Many countries in the Middle East and Africa have reported increased trafficking and misuse of the synthetic opioid tramadol.  Misuse of tramadol could lead to a demand for even more toxic forms of synthetic opioids.  Criminals have been quick to capitalize on the low risk and cost of synthetic opioids, and continue to develop and introduce new analogues to markets.  In 2012, governments reported just three synthetic opioid NPS to the United Nations, increasing to 10 in 2016.  By 2018, according to the INCB, 37 countries had reported seizing 40 different opioid-type NPS, mostly fentanyl or fentanyl-related substances.    In addition to new fentanyl analogues, counterfeit variations of oxycodone, tramadol, and other pharmaceutical products continue to make inroads in the United States and other markets.  Trafficking and abuse of synthetic opioids has become a top concern of governments in Africa, South Asia, and the Middle East, particularly related to counterfeit or illicitly manufactured tramadol.  Within the EU, 38 synthetic opioid NPS have been detected since 2009, with 13 reported in 2017, including 10 fentanyl analogues.  The international legal framework for drug control is struggling to keep pace with the speed by which criminals can develop new NPS.  The United Nations drug control treaties, as well as the laws of many countries, continue to control drugs individually according to their chemical structure – a time consuming process.  Many countries – including the United States – have enacted legislative reforms within the scope of international law to review and control NPS based on their psychoactive effects or broader category of classification (class-based scheduling), rather than precise chemical structure.    In November 2018, during the G-20 Meeting in Buenos Aires, China agreed to reclassify fentanyl as a controlled substance in its internal list of regulatory precursor chemicals.  According to China’s Foreign Ministry, the country will schedule the entire category of fentanyl-type substances as controlled substances, and start the process of revising relevant laws and regulations.  Full implementation of this announced reform could make an important impact in reducing the availability of fentanyl analogues.    Carfentanil.  Carfentanil is a particularly potent fentanyl analogue not approved for use in humans that is contributing to opioid-related overdose deaths.  Used as a veterinary tranquilizer for large mammals, carfentanil is up to 100 times more potent than fentanyl, and controlled under Schedule II of the Controlled Substances Act.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  51  Evidence obtained from seized drug supplies indicates that carfentanil is commonly used as an adulterant in other illicit drugs, such as heroin or cocaine, or mixed with diluents and pressed into counterfeit prescription pills.  According to data obtained from National Forensic Laboratory Information System (NFLIS), there have been at least 2,900 domestic carfentanil encounters in over 21 states in the United States since 2016.    The presence of carfentanil in the illicit drug market poses a serious threat to the public health given users are often unaware the product they are purchasing contains carfentanil.  At the 61st CND in March 2018, based on the WHO’s recommendation, UN Member states voted to internationally control carfentanil and five other fentanyl analogues under Schedules I and IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs.     The Single Convention on Narcotics Drugs of 1961 is an international treaty barring production and supply of specific narcotic drugs of similar effects except under license for specific purposes, such as medical treatment and research.  Schedules I and IV of the 1961 Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs are considered the strictest level of controls of dangerous narcotics and their production components.    Heroin.  Heroin is derived from the opium poppy plant and can be lethal if taken on regular basis.  Traffickers are increasingly mixing fentanyl into heroin to stretch supplies and maximize profits, often without the knowledge of users.  The main precursor chemical used to produce heroin is acetic anhydride, a substance also widely used in legitimate industry.  Drug trafficking organizations continue to channel acetic anhydride to illicit producers through diversion, or smuggling.  Acetic anhydride may also be used as a compound substance to produce a chemical reaction in the production of methamphetamine.      According to the INCB, there has been a sharp increase in the demand for acetic anhydride for illicit purposes since 2016, particularly in the EU.  However, detected attempts by traffickers to divert the substance from international supply channels have gradually decreased in number.  One reason for the detected decline in diversion attempts could be that traffickers have succeeded in diverting and stockpiling sufficient amounts.    Seizures of acetic anhydride of suspected European origin continued in Europe and West Asia in 2017 and 2018.  In total, 20 countries reported seizing shipments of acetic anhydride in 2017, amounting to almost 127,000 liters.  The largest volume of total seizures was reported by Afghanistan (37,700 liters), followed by Turkey (23,200 liters) and Iran (20,300 liters).  Countries reporting total seizures of more than 5,000 liters included Bulgaria, Mexico, Japan, the Netherlands, and Pakistan.  Despite the fact that diversion attempts appear to have decreased since 2016, suspicious requests for supplies of acetic anhydride continue to be posted on certain online trading platforms.  In this regard, the United States continues to work closely with participant countries of the INCB Precursor Task Force of Project Prism and Project Cohesion to counter acetic anhydride diversion.  The United States also provides assistance to expand international use of the INCB’s PEN Online and PICS to control and to monitor the diversion of acetic anhydride and other chemicals.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  52   For activities under Project Prism and Project Cohesion, participating governments are requested to register points of contact (focal points) for their relevant national authorities involved in precursor control, such as national regulatory, law enforcement, customs and drug control agencies, and to actively use the system to communicate all incidents involving precursor chemicals.  Governments that have not yet registered PICS points of contact for their national authorities involved in precursor control may request an account by writing to incb.pics@un.org.     Methamphetamine.  Methamphetamine is produced using a variety of methods, but most require one or more of the following precursor chemicals: pseudoephedrine; ephedrine; pharmaceutical products containing these chemicals; phenyl-2-propanone (P-2-P); and phenylacetic acid.  Use of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine in the illicit manufacture of methamphetamine is predominant in Asia, Oceania, Africa and in some regions in Europe.  In the Western Hemisphere, the bulk of illicitly manufactured methamphetamine is made using P-2-P-based methods.  As these precursor chemicals have become more difficult to obtain due to increased controls, traffickers have started using other chemicals, or seeking non-controlled pre-precursor chemicals or esters, and derivatives of phenylacetic acid to produce the precursor chemicals necessary for methamphetamine production.    In 2017, seizures of phenylacetic acid were predominantly in Mexico, with 19.5 metric tons (MT) seized in clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.  It was not clear if the phenylacetic acid seized in Mexico had been illicitly manufactured from one of its precursors, such as 2-phenylacetamide, which is also controlled in Mexico.   Traffickers, particularly in Europe, may be still using the pre-precursor APAAN, or alpha-phenylacetoacetonitrile for the production of methamphetamine.  This chemical was added to the list of internationally controlled chemicals under the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 2014.  In Europe, there are limited legitimate uses for APAAN, and therefore imports are likely to be intended for conversion to benzyl methyl ketone (BMK), an amphetamine precursor.  According to the INCB, three European countries reported seizing APAAN between 2016 and 2017. Together, the amounts seized totaled less than 600 kilograms (kg) in 2017, less than half the amount seized in 2016.      Methamphetamine production takes place domestically within the United States and worldwide.  Domestic small production capacity laboratories (SPCLs) are the most frequently encountered type of clandestine laboratory.  These SPCLs tend to be low production operations (grams or ounces), and make up only a small percentage of the drug that is consumed in the United States.  The emergence of the “one-pot labs” (a.k.a. “shake-n-bake” labs) constitute the majority of SPCLs found domestically.  These laboratories typically use two-liter plastic soda bottles, 16-20 ounce drink containers, and other such receptacles.  Only rudimentary technical skills are required to manufacture methamphetamine using these methods.  Pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are the principal precursor chemicals used in the SPCLs and are purchased over the counter from retail pharmacies and convenience stores.  Most of the \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  53  methamphetamine available in the United States, however, is produced abroad, and trafficking across the U.S. southern border increased exponentially in 2018.  Traffickers increasingly prefer new production methods to manufacture methamphetamine that do not require ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  These methods were identified in 98 percent of all samples seized by the DEA in the United States in 2017.    Most large-scale manufacturers in Mexico are believed to use the P-2-P method to manufacture the precursor chemicals required to produce methamphetamine.  However, there have been some indications of a possible shift to the phenylacetic acid method.  Mexican authorities seized large volumes of phenylacetic acid (20 MT) in 2017.  Chemical analysis of future seizures may help provide additional analysis on emerging production methods used by Mexican drug trafficking organizations.   Countries in Africa and Asia, where precursors like P-2-P and APAAN are relatively unknown, continue to rely on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to produce top quality methamphetamine.  There are indications, however, that Mexican alternate methods to produce methamphetamine are being expanded in Africa.  Moreover, traffickers may also be shifting to adopt the use of APAA, or Alpha-phenylacetoacetamide, as a substitute chemical for P-2-P and APAAN.  This shift began after APAAN was scheduled under Table I of the 1988 UN Drug Convention in 2014.  In 2018, the INCB recommended that APAA be added to the list scheduled under Table I.    Cocaine.  Potassium permanganate, an oxidizer, is the primary chemical used to remove the impurities from cocaine base.  It has many legitimate industrial uses, including waste-water treatment, and as a disinfectant and deodorizer.  During the first 10 months of 2018, more than 30 countries shipped more than 25,500 MT of potassium permanganate to over 120 importing countries and territories.  Potassium permanganate can also be combined with pseudoephedrine to produce methcathinone, a synthetic psychoactive stimulant controlled under the 1971 UN Convention.   In South America, the only region of the world where large quantities of coca leaf are cultivated, traffickers continue to divert chemicals from legitimate industry, either from domestic or international sources, for cocaine production.  A growing trend cited by law enforcement officials is the recycling of chemicals, which allows clandestine laboratory operators to reuse chemicals up to four times before they need to be replaced.  The two main sources of the potassium permanganate used for illicit purposes appear to be diversion from licit domestic distribution channels and subsequent smuggling to illicit processing sites either within the same country or across sub-regional borders, and illicit manufacture.  Traffickers are also producing their own potassium permanganate, particularly in Colombia.  Alternative precursor chemicals as well as solvent mixtures used in cocaine manufacturing have also been detected.  Countries in Central and South America have a variety of other chemicals under national control, which are known to have been used in the illicit manufacture of cocaine.  These include common acids and bases, oxidizing agents, solvents used for the extraction of cocaine base from coca leaves and for the conversion of cocaine base into cocaine hydrochloride, as well as precursors of and substitutes for potassium permanganate.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  54  Additionally, traffickers continue to recycle the chemical containers, making it difficult to trace the origin of the chemicals inside.  INCB’s Project Cohesion monitors the imports of potassium permanganate to cocaine processing areas.  The United States, the INCB, and other international partners encourage countries in South and Central America to continue sharing information on these new trends.  Future Trends.  Drug traffickers will continue to adapt to new production methods and exploit chemicals not controlled under the Convention or domestic laws.  To avoid enforcement pressure, criminals will also continue to take advantage of countries with limited enforcement and regulatory capacity, and frequently obtain chemicals produced within countries where illicit drugs are produced, thereby escaping international monitoring, surveillance, and interdiction efforts.  It is critical to continue efforts to strengthen the capacity of law enforcement, public health institutions, and transportation and shipment industries to minimize illicit precursor chemical diversion.  It is also important to enhance international cooperation to combat the threats posed by domestic chemical diversion.  Toxic adulterants is also of concern as drug traffickers continue to manipulate illicit drug composition with distinct pharmacological products.  Drug traffickers have traditionally mixed non-toxic materials such as lactose and glucose into drug supplies to increase profitability, but there is growing evidence that traffickers are increasingly mixing banned or controlled toxic substances including pharmaceutical drugs and fungicides into illicit drugs to increase drug potency and produce enhanced psychoactive effects.    Many street drugs contain multiple toxic adulterants, numerous controlled substances, and impurities from the heroin manufacturing process.  However, crime laboratories, emergency departments, and medical examiners do not routinely test for adulterants unless given a specific reason to do so.  It is vital that law enforcement authorities continue to test drug samples for toxic adulterants, alerting public health authorities of additional negative effects toxic adulterants can cause to the body, including death.     Major Chemical Source Countries and Territories  This section focuses on individual countries with large chemical manufacturing industries that have significant trade with drug-producing regions and those with significant chemical commerce susceptible to diversion domestically for smuggling into drug-producing countries.  Designation as a major chemical source country does not indicate a lack of adequate chemical control legislation or the ability to enforce it.  Rather, it recognizes that the volume of chemical trade with drug-producing regions, or proximity to them, makes these countries the sources of the greatest quantities of chemicals liable to diversion.  The United States, with its large chemical industry and extensive trade with drug-producing regions, is included on the list.    Many other countries manufacture and trade in chemicals, but not on the same scale, or with the broad range of precursor chemicals, as the countries in this section.  These two sections are broken down by region.    Africa   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  55   Nigeria    Nigeria’s National Agency for Food and Drug Administration and Control (NAFDAC) is the primary government agency responsible for preventing diversion of precursor chemicals in Nigeria.  Since 2011, 11 clandestine methamphetamine laboratories have been detected in Nigeria, making Nigeria an emerging major producing country for methamphetamine.  In addition to the emerging methamphetamine threat, Nigeria is also developing into a major transshipment country for ephedrine, a precursor chemical used in the production of methamphetamine.  Precursor chemicals – mainly ephedrine – are imported from India and China then diverted to the laboratory operators.    In July 2018, the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency’s Sensitive Investigative Unit reported that it seized 50 kg of ephedrine destined for a methamphetamine lab in Anambra, Nigeria.  The ephedrine was produced in India then shipped to Ghana.  From Ghana it was smuggled to Kano, Nigeria and was seized in Kogi, Nigeria while in route to Anambra.  Aggregate 2018 seizure data pertaining to precursor chemicals were not available at the time of this report.  South Africa  South Africa is a leading regional importer of chemicals used in the production of illicit drugs, particularly synthetic drugs.  The South African Police Services (SAPS) has a trained, dedicated clandestine laboratory team.  The SAPS division of the Directorate for Priority Crime Investigations (DPCI) estimates 40-50 clandestine laboratories are dismantled annually within the country.  According to statistics released in September 2018, SAPS reported a 10.5 percent increase in drug-related crimes from fiscal years 2016-2017 to 2017-2018.  Enforcement teams from the South African Revenue Service (SARS) also seize illicit drugs and precursor chemicals, including ethanol and toluene.    Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine used in South Africa to synthesize methamphetamine largely originate in Nigeria and India.  South African authorities regularly report newly identified precursor substances used in illicit drug production to the INCB.  South Africa also submits information on seized precursor shipments to the INCB’s PICS.  Restricting and analyzing the trade of precursors are mandated by the South Africa National Drug Policy, which mandates the establishment of computerized inventory control systems for scheduled chemicals and regulating and monitoring the purchase of medicines containing precursors via a registry system.  Such measure have not been fully implemented.   The nexus between wildlife trafficking and trafficking in precursors and illicit drugs is being investigated.  U.S. law enforcement collaboration with South Africa on investigations is productive but sporadic, and U.S. authorities regularly share information on container shipments suspected of containing possible illicit materials with South African counterparts.   North America    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  56  Canada    Canada has a large chemical industry and strong legislation, which allow for effective regulatory controls over the industry.  Canada’s “Controlled Drugs and Substances Act” (CDSA) and its regulations provide the legislative framework for the control of chemical precursors.  Health Canada submits an annual report to the INCB with respect to its obligations under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  The annual report provides information on licit imports and exports for the previous year, stopped shipments and seizures, and refusals of permit applications due to objections from foreign authorities.  The report also details information received from the INCB, and incomplete or invalid application information.   Canada cooperates fully with the INCB in cases where shipments may pose a concern.  Scheduling of substances under the CDSA and its regulations give law enforcement agencies the authority to take action against activities that are not in accordance with the law.  These instruments also authorize Health Canada to communicate information collected to law enforcement agencies, border control officers, foreign competent authorities and the INCB if necessary.  As a state party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, Canada is obligated to impose controls on substances in response to decisions of the CND.  Canada continues to explore ways to prevent the illicit diversion of chemical precursors through legislative and regulatory channels.    Mexico    Mexico has several major chemical manufacturing and trade industries that produce, import, or export chemicals required for illicit drug production.  Mexican laws regulate the production and use of many of these substances and the Mexican Federal Commission for the Protection Against Sanitary Risk (COFEPRIS) is responsible for enforcing chemical control laws.  In addition, Mexico controls all chemicals listed in the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Mexican government agencies, to include Customs and the Mexican Regulatory Agency, continue to monitor the importation of controlled precursor chemicals, but this has not significantly deterred local methamphetamine production.  Although Mexico-based transnational criminal organizations are major producers of methamphetamine, imports of methamphetamine precursors pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are outlawed, and they are not produced legally within the country.  Mexico regulates the importation of precursor chemicals, including phenylacetic acid, methylamine, hydriodic acid, and red phosphorous.  The importation of formaldehyde and ammonium chloride continues to be monitored due to their potential diversion, as these chemicals can be used to manufacture methylamine, a key chemical for methamphetamine production.    Despite monitoring and regulations, illicit precursor importers attempt to move chemicals undetected within the country.  Importers continue to mislabel shipments, which poses a challenge for law enforcement in detecting the importation of chemicals coming from source countries such as India and China.  Importers also exploit regulatory vulnerabilities in Central America to smuggle precursor chemicals into Guatemala and Honduras and eventually to Mexico for use in methamphetamine production.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  57  The Mexican government controls two fentanyl precursor chemicals NPP and ANPP.  While these controls have not fully deterred criminal organizations from obtaining these chemicals, it has forced criminals to seek chemical alternatives, while providing Mexican regulatory and law enforcement agencies a legal basis to seize these substances and file criminal or civil charges against those illegally importing them.  Despite controls, the small quantities needed for fentanyl production present a challenge to law enforcement in the detection of these chemicals as they enter Mexico.    Mexico participates in international efforts to control precursors and has a strong bilateral working relationship with the United States.  Mexico signed a memorandum of cooperation with the United States in 2012 to address precursor chemicals and clandestine laboratories.  The two governments also cooperate to share best practices with Central American countries affected by the trafficking of precursor chemicals.  U.S. government agencies continue to provide training and equipment to both Mexican and Central American law enforcement agencies to address existing and emerging synthetic drug threats in the region.    The United States    The United States manufactures and/or trades in almost all 28 chemicals listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 UN Drug Convention to which it is a party, and it has laws and regulations implementing chemical control provisions.    The foundation of U.S. chemical control is the Chemical Diversion and Trafficking Act of 1988.  This law and subsequent chemical control provisions of the U.S. drug law are interwoven into the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, rather than individual stand-alone legislation.  The DEA is responsible for administering and enforcing these laws.    The Department of Justice, primarily through its U.S. Attorneys, handles criminal and civil prosecutions at the federal level.  In addition to registration and recordkeeping requirements, the legislation requires importers and exporters to file import or export notifications at least 15 days before the transaction is to take place.  The 15-day advanced notification permits DEA to evaluate the transaction.  However, the legislation and regulations allow for a waiver of the 15-day advance notification if a company has an established business relationship for a specified listed chemical or chemicals with its foreign customer that has been reported to DEA, subject to the criteria in the Code of Federal Regulations.  In these cases, same-day notification is permitted for future shipments.  Diversion investigators and special agents communicate with exporting and importing government officials in this process.  The legislation also gives the DEA the authority to suspend shipments.    U.S. legislation requires chemical handlers to report to DEA suspicious transactions such as those involving extraordinary quantities or unusual methods of payment.  Criminal penalties for chemical diversion are strict; the penalties for some chemical trafficking offenses involving methamphetamine are tied to the quantities of drugs that could have been produced with the diverted chemicals.  If the diversion of listed chemicals is detected, persons or companies may be prosecuted or the DEA registration may be revoked.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  58  The Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005 (CMEA) mandated DEA to establish total annual requirements, import quotas, individual manufacturing quotas, and procurement quotas for three List 1 chemicals:  pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and phenylpropanolamine.  This affected those DEA-registered importers and manufacturers that wish to import or conduct manufacturing activities with these chemicals.  The CMEA also restricted retail level transactions of nonprescription drug products that contain ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, or phenylpropanolamine, now known as “scheduled listed chemical products.”  The CMEA and other chemical control legislation are aimed at preventing the illicit manufacture of illegal drugs domestically and internationally.    The United States has played a leading role in the design, promotion, and implementation of cooperative multilateral chemical control initiatives.  The United States also actively works with other concerned nations, and with the UNODC and the INCB to develop information sharing procedures to better control precursor chemicals and non-controlled substances used in the illicit production of drugs. U.S. officials are members of a combined task force for both Project Cohesion and Project Prism.  The United States has established close operational cooperation with counterparts in major chemical manufacturing and trading countries.  This cooperation includes information sharing in support of chemical control programs and to prevent chemical diversion.  Central America and the Caribbean    Costa Rica  Costa Rica has a stringent licensing process for the importation and distribution of precursor chemicals, and has implemented precursor diversion prevention measures recommended by the INCB.  Costa Rica has controls for Table I and Table II precursor and essential chemicals as defined by the 1988 UN Drug Convention.   The Costa Rican government’s National Plan on Drugs for 2018-2025 recognizes the international problem of production and trafficking of chemical precursors.  Costa Rica has yet to seize large amounts of the substances compared to elsewhere in the region and imports a relatively low volume of precursor chemicals.    The Costa Rican Drug Institute has a special unit dedicated to the control and regulation of precursor chemicals, and this unit has broad powers to monitor and respond to illegal activity.  By law, importers and businesses that handle chemical precursors or certain types of prescription drugs are required to submit monthly reports through an online tracking system.  During the first 10 months of 2018, there were 2,336 authorized import transactions, licensed to 199 registered importers of chemical precursors (three occasional importers and 196 regular importers).  The system tracks the movement of chemical precursors and solvents and also generates alerts.  Costa Rica received one specific alert during the January-October 2018 period for possible participation of one importer in irregular activity.  The source of the alert provided limited information, which was in the process of being verified and investigated at the time of this report.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  59  Dominican Republic    The Dominican Republic has implemented a chemical control regime in accordance with Article 12 of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Dominican laws regulate the production and use of the 28 chemicals listed in the Convention and the Dominican Republic annually submits information required by the Convention.  The National Directorate for Drug Control (DNCD) is responsible for enforcing chemical control laws.  The Dominican Republic does not have a large petrochemical industry engaged in the manufacturing, importation, and exportation of chemical products.  Chemicals for industrial production are imported from the United States.  The two largest chemical imports are sodium carbonate and toluene, used in the Dominican Republic as an additive for gasoline and as a solvent for paint.    The DNCD regulates and enforces the importation and use of precursor chemicals.  The DNCD receives pre-notifications for precursor imports and issues certificates of importation.  The DNCD also controls and regulates prescription drugs and issues annual permits to medical doctors, clinics, and hospitals, maintaining a register of the type of drug and amount each doctor prescribes each year, especially for drugs containing opiates.  Clinics and hospitals are mandated to report prescriptions for certain drugs before dispensing them and the DNCD verifies that the prescription number and the doctor are valid before authorizing the sale.  The DNCD is taking steps to automate its paper-based chemical control registration.   El Salvador    El Salvador is party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, and invokes its rights to pre-notification of scheduled precursor chemicals under Article 12.  Precursor chemical trafficking remains a regional threat, as methamphetamine production continues to spread from Mexico into neighboring Guatemala.    With U.S. assistance, the INCB trains the Government of El Salvador and its national authorities to comply with the provisions of the three international drug control conventions in the regulatory control of the licit trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, and the monitoring of precursor chemicals.  The ultimate goal is to facilitate the appropriate availability of internationally controlled substances for medical, scientific and industrial purposes, yet prevent their abuse and diversion to illicit channels.    Guatemala    In 2018, the Guatemalan Vice Minister of Counter Narcotics devoted increased attention to the problem of precursor chemical diversion, after an annual seizure of 26 MT of precursor chemicals used to produce heroin, cocaine hydrochloride, and methamphetamine.  However, the Ministry of Health is responsible for the regulation of chemicals in Guatemala and lacks the investigative depth to verify any information beyond cursory regulatory permits.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  60  Due to a lack of cooperation between investigators and regulators, the Guatemalan government determined that it lacked legal standing to seize these chemicals, and these 26 MT were ultimately returned to their owner.  Existing Guatemalan laws and regulations are not sufficiently utilized to determine whether chemical imports are ultimately used for legitimate commercial purposes or diverted to produce illicit drugs.  Additionally, there are no verifications in place that would allow authorities to determine whether quantities of imports are reasonable for stated commercial purposes.    To improve the local government’s capability to manage the precursor chemical issue, the U.S. government supported training to increase the Guatemalan government’s ability investigate, and interdict precursors in 2018, as well as promote improved interagency cooperation.  The United States is also working with Guatemalan authorities to establish a Precursor Chemicals Response Team, and provides training to local investigators on precursor cases.  In addition, the United States is providing training for up to 50 drug detection canines to detect precursor chemicals and synthetic drugs, including fentanyl.    Since 2005, the Guatemalan government has been storing large quantities of seized precursor chemicals, though an incinerator donated by the United States in 2017 continues to be utilized by local authorities to reduce the backlog.  As of October 2018, there were approximately 2,400 MT of seized precursor chemicals in Guatemala.  Authorities are working to consolidate seized precursors currently stored around the country at the incinerator site.    Honduras    Precursor chemical diversion continues to be a problem in Honduras.  The Government of Honduras works closely with U.S. authorities to disrupt the importation and diversion of precursor chemicals through Honduras.  The United States provides training and other assistance to help strengthen the capacity of Honduran institutions responsible for controlling precursor chemicals.    Scientific knowledge within Honduras about precursor chemicals is limited and often out of date, and information sharing between government institutions regarding synthetic drug and precursor chemical trafficking is challenging.  The responsibility for the control of precursor chemicals is spread through a variety of agencies in Honduras including the Directorate of Investigation and Intelligence; the Directorate for the Fight against Drug Trafficking; the Public Ministry; the HNP; the Health Ministry, the Agency of Sanitary regulation and the Customs Authority.  These agencies have limited experience working together and do not have an established means to collaborate comprehensively to combat the diversion of precursor chemicals.  The 1989 Law on the Misuse and Illicit Traffic of Drugs and Psychotropic Substances is the current legislation governing the illicit movement of precursor chemicals, but the legislation does not adequately address synthetic drug trafficking or precursor chemicals.  The Precursor Chemical and Synthetic drug Board is working with health, justice, and law enforcement officials to draft a specific law to address the trafficking of chemical precursors.     South America   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  61   Argentina  Argentina’s proximity to top cocaine producing nations and its role as a large producer of chemical precursors makes it vulnerable to the use of precursors in the production of illegal narcotics.  Argentina has enacted legislative measures to curb the illicit use and diversion of chemical precursors.  The Security Ministry’s National Register of Chemical Precursors was created in 2005.  Its Federal Council for Chemical Precursors is responsible for analysis and investigations of crimes associated with chemical precursor diversions.  Argentina maintains a focus on chemical precursors used in the production of cocaine, but is shifting attention towards those used in the production of methamphetamines and synthetic drugs.  Brazil   Brazil is one of the world’s 10 largest chemical producing countries by volume.  Brazil licenses, controls, and inspects essential and precursor chemical products, including potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride, in conformity with its obligations under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Controls on both potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride allow for commercial sales without restriction for quantities of up to one kg for potassium permanganate and one liter of acetic anhydride.  The Brazilian Federal Police (DPF) Chemical Division controls and monitors 146 chemical products in conjunction with 27 DPF regional divisions and 97 resident offices.  The Chemical Division is composed of two units: the Chemical Control Division, subordinate to the DPF Executive Directorate, and the Criminal Diversion Investigations unit under the Organized Crime Division.  Both divisions routinely coordinate and share information when conducting administrative inspections and criminal investigations.  The Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) controls precursor chemical substances used in the pharmaceutical industry.  In March 2017, ANVISA added ANPP and NPP to its list of controlled chemical substances, without banning their use.  Regulatory guidelines require chemical handlers to be registered and licensed to conduct activities such as manufacturing, importing, exporting, storing, transporting, commercializing and distributing chemicals.  The DPF uses a National Computerized System of Chemical Control to monitor all chemical movements in the country, including imports/exports, and licensing.  This system requires all companies to register with an online system and to report all activity conducted, including the submission of monthly reports for all chemical related movements and existing chemical inventories.  Brazil reports to the INCB its annual estimates of legitimate requirements for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for quantities above 10 grams, and P-2-P in any amount using the INCB’s PEN Online.  The DPF routinely uses PEN Online in cases of international trade and in coordination with UN member states to alert importing countries with details of an export transaction.   Chile  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  62   Chile complies with its international obligations to the 1988 UN Drug Convention and furnishes reports through the International Narcotic Control Board’s online reporting system, PEN Online.  Chile has a large mining industry engaged in the manufacturing, import, and export of chemical products.  Most of the chemical substances seized by law enforcement are those used for the processing of cocaine products, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, acetone and sodium hydroxide.  Since 2009 there have been no seizures of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, used as precursors for methamphetamine.  The largest imports of controlled chemical substances and related products come from Germany and the United States, while Ecuador and Bolivia are the primary export destinations.  The regulatory entity for chemical controls is the Unit of Controlled Chemical Substances (DSQC), a sub secretariat of the Ministry of Interior and Public Safety.  The DSQC manages the System of Registration and Administration of Controlled Chemical Substances (SIREGAD-SQC), which collects information on the production, manufacture, preparation, importation, and exportation of chemical substances that could be used in the production of illicit drugs.  Companies that import, export, or manufacture chemical precursors must register with SIREGAD-SQC, maintain customer records, and are subject to regular inspections.  The new online SIREGAD-SQC has improved capabilities for real-time data, and can analyze controlled chemical trends in Chile.  Currently, 586 companies are registered in the system.  In 2018, the government proposed to add 15 new chemical substances to the country’s control list, among them adulterants, bulking drugs derived from cocaine, and substances used for the manufacture of synthetic drugs.    Chilean law enforcement entities have specialized chemical diversion units and dedicated personnel assigned responsibility for investigating chemical and pharmaceutical diversion cases.  Customs, which is not a traditional law enforcement agency, has a risk analysis unit that profiles suspicious imports and exports, which may include chemical precursors.  During 2017, the Ministry of Interior conducted training sessions for law enforcement and security personnel to highlight the role of chemical precursor agents in the illegal manufacture of psychoactive drugs.  From 2017 to 2018, the DSQC conducted 304 inspections and audits, which resulted in sanctioning procedures against 64 companies for failure to comply with the registration and declaration requirements for Chilean precursor chemicals.  Ecuador    Under Ecuadorian law, potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride are designated as controlled chemicals.  Buying, selling, or importing such chemicals requires the permission of the Ministry of Interior, the primary agency responsible for precursor chemical control in Ecuador.  According to Article 219 in the 2014 Penal Code, the use of precursor chemicals to produce, manufacture, or prepare illicit materials, such as cocaine or heroin is punishable by three to five years in prison.   The chemical unit of the National Antinarcotics Directorate (DNA) in the Ecuadorian National Police plays an active role in chemical control by carrying out investigations and intelligence \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  63  operations.  Although DNA’s chemical unit is a highly competent entity, its small size and outdated technology hinder operations.  The unit conducts limited operations in Esmeraldas and Huaquillas, where drug labs and trafficking are prevalent, due to the porous land borders with Colombia and Peru.  Because of its small workforce of only 26 employees, the chemical unit must often rely on ad hoc support from police officers from other units who generally lack adequate chemical training.   Ecuador has been importing large quantities of potassium permanganate for at least the past decade.  According to the Central Bank of Ecuador, during the first eight months of 2018, Ecuador imported 31.2 MT of potassium permanganate, compared to 40.8 MT in all of 2017.  Potassium permanganate is a controlled chemical and requires an import license in order to be imported into the country.  Most 2018 imports of potassium permanganate originated from China.  Similar to potassium permanganate, acetic anhydride is also a controlled chemical requiring an import license.  During the first eight months of 2018, Ecuador imported 49.21 MT of acetic anhydride, compared to 0.12 MT imported during all of 2017.  There were few imports of acetic anhydride imports in 2017 due to vendor difficulties in complying with importing controls that year.  Most 2018 imports of acetic anhydride originated from Mexico.  Traffickers also continue to smuggle liquid chemicals, including ether, from Ecuador to Colombia and Peru for cocaine processing.   Venezuela  Limited coca cultivation occurs along Venezuela’s border with Colombia.  Some precursor chemicals used to produce cocaine are trafficked through Venezuela, but the quantity is unknown.  In 2018, Venezuelan authorities did not release statistics on seizures of drug labs or precursor chemicals.  The Venezuelan government has not reported the production of NPS in Venezuela.  Asia    Bangladesh    Transnational drug trafficking organizations with connections to Burma and India operate within Bangladesh.  Over the past three years, Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies have reported trafficking of synthetic drugs such as “yaba” (a mixture of caffeine and methamphetamine, sometimes with heroin) and diverted pharmaceutical drugs, such as phensedyl (codeine-based cough syrup).  Bangladesh has successfully engaged bilaterally with India to control the diversion of phensedyl, and Bangladeshi law enforcement agencies work closely with DEA to seize and disrupt illicit drugs and chemicals.  According to the Bangladesh Ministry of Home Affairs, phensedyl diversion into the country reduced dramatically in 2018.  In October 2018, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina approved in principle the draft of “Narcotics Control Act 2018,” (NCA 2018) which prescribes a death sentence as a maximum punishment for anyone involved in producing, smuggling, distributing or using over five grams of yaba or amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  The minimum sentence is life in prison.  NCA 2018 also prescribes between five and 15 years in jail for carrying, trafficking, or smuggling less \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  64  than five grams of yaba.  Furthermore, NCA 2018 prescribes a death sentence as maximum punishment, and life imprisonment as a minimum, for anyone involved in producing, smuggling, distributing, or using 25 grams or more of “Category A” drugs, which include heroin or cocaine.  Yaba and ATS are elevated to Category A drugs under the NCA 2018.  Officials at the Department of Narcotics Control (DNC) and other law enforcement agencies have stated that drug offenders exploited loopholes under existing legislation in order to evade punishment.  The Government of Bangladesh is committed to the implementation of the 1988 UN Drug Convention and regional agreements regarding control of narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances and precursor chemicals.  Twenty-three of the 28 precursor chemicals listed in the 1988 UN Drug Convention are included in the “Schedule of Drugs” of NCA 1990 to comply with the provisions of Article 12 of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  NCA 1990 also allows financial investigations and freezing of assets derived from trafficking in drugs and precursors.  The government provides the INCB with annual estimates of Bangladesh’s legitimate use requirements for imports of the four precursors frequently used in the manufacture of ATS—3, 4-MDP-2-P, pseudoephedrine, ephedrine, and P-2-P under CND Resolution 49/3.  The Directorate General of Drug Administration has developed a draft national drug policy, approved by the Cabinet in December 2016, in response to the threat posed by the abuse of, and trafficking in, pharmaceutical preparations and other drugs.  The “National Drug Policy 2016” replaced the “National Drug Policy 2005” and aims to ensure that the manufacturing of medicines is in compliance with international standards to increase export of pharmaceutical items.  The new policy also proposes forming a National Drug Regulatory Authority to stop the adulteration of medicines and raw materials.  Responsible authorities will be required to update the price of drugs every year and publish the updated prices online.  Bangladesh has a nascent but growing commercial pharmaceutical industry.  Besides meeting 97 percent of the local demand, many pharmaceutical companies are exporting medicines to over 122 countries.  In 2015, the first Bangladeshi company received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to export a prescription drug for hypertension to the United States, followed by a second approval to export a cardiovascular drug.  Other top listed pharmaceutical companies are now trying to get FDA approval to enter the U.S. market.  Bangladeshi pharmaceutical companies focus primarily on branded generic final formulations.  About 85 percent of the drugs sold in Bangladesh are generic and 15 percent are patented drugs.  Bangladesh manufactures more than 450 generic drugs, sold under 5,300 registered brands that have 8,300 different dosages and strengths.  These include a wide range of products from anti-ulcerants, flouroquinolones, anti-rheumatic non-steroid drugs, non-narcotic analgesics, anti-histamines, and oral anti-diabetic drugs.  Bangladesh is also producing high-tech medicines like anticancer drugs, hormonal products, enzymes and coenzymes at a limited scale, meeting only four percent of Bangladesh’s total requirements.  As such, Bangladesh’s chemical imports are primarily in these pharmaceutical categories.   China    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  65  China has implemented a strict licensing regime for the production, sale, and transport of drug precursor chemicals.  The National Narcotics Control Commission of China (NNCC) is the agency with primary responsibility for drug precursor chemical control.  China maintains a list of controlled precursor chemicals called the “Catalogue of Precursor Chemicals,” which currently includes 32 drug precursor chemicals.  China’s catalogue includes notable precursors potassium permanganate (cocaine), acetic anhydride (heroin), and ephedrine and pseudoephedrine (methamphetamine).  In February 2018, China added key fentanyl precursors ANPP and NPP to the catalogue.  China regularly provides precursor shipment data the INCB’s Pre-Export Notification system.  During the November 2018 G-20 Meeting in Buenos Aires, China agreed to reclassify fentanyl as a controlled substance in its internal list of regulatory precursor chemicals.  According to China’s Foreign Ministry, the country will schedule the entire category of fentanyl-type substances as controlled substances, and start the process of revising relevant laws and regulations.  Full implementation of this announced reform could make an important impact in reducing the availability of fentanyl analogues.    Both U.S. law enforcement and China’s NNCC recognize the diversion of drug precursors to illicit manufacture as a significant problem in China.  In their 2017 Annual Drug Report, the NNCC reported 388 cases of drug precursor-related crime, an increase of 39.6 percent over the previous year.  Additionally, the NNCC reported seizing 2,384 MT of precursor chemicals, an increase of 50.5 percent over the previous year.  U.S. law enforcement reports that the most common diversion tactic used by traffickers is the intentional mislabeling of shipments containing precursors.  Perpetrators caught mislabeling precursor shipments often face only civil penalties and small fines rather than criminal charges.  The challenge of preventing precursor diversion is further exacerbated by China’s ineffective enforcement of land, air, and sea transport regulations.    Hong Kong Special Administrative Region   Hong Kong, a Special Administrative Region of the People’s Republic of China, is neither a drug manufacturing nor chemical producing economy.  With well-developed logistics connectivity to China, one of the world’s largest precursor chemical exporters, Hong Kong’s chemical trade is mostly in the form of imports for consolidation and subsequent re-export or transshipments; only small amounts are consumed locally by industrial, pharmaceutical, testing or education activities.    In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, controlled chemical imports totaled approximately 12.32 MT, with approximately 1.31 MT re-exported.  Hong Kong supports international efforts to prevent precursor chemical diversion through a combination of effective legislation, strong law enforcement, and close collaboration with the INCB, other foreign counterparts, and the business community.  The Control of Chemicals (COC) Ordinance, in effect since 1996, is Hong Kong’s basic legislation for regulating possession, manufacture, transport, and distribution of designated controlled chemicals.  In May 2018, the COC Ordinance (Amendment of Schedule 2) Order \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  66  2018 and the Hong Kong Dangerous Drugs Ordinance (DDO) (Amendment of First Schedule) Order 2018 came into effect.  The COC Order added a total of 29 chemicals, including ANPP and NPP, two precursor chemicals used in the synthesis of fentanyl and its analogues, and all chemicals in the 1988 UN Drug Convention, to Schedule 2 of the COC.    The DDO Order added additional synthetic drugs to the First Schedule of the DDO, including EPH, MPA, MDMB-CHMICA, SF-APINACA, and the synthetic opioid U-47700.  The COC, which establishes a licensing regime over importers, exporters, dealers, traders, manufacturers, and handlers of the designated chemicals, applies equally to imports, exports, and transshipments.  Permits for every shipment are mandatory.  Government approval for all premises and containers used to store such chemicals is also mandatory.  The maximum penalty for illicit chemical trafficking is imprisonment for 15 years and a fine of $130,000.  The Controlled Chemicals Group (CCG) of the Hong Kong Customs and Excise Department’s Drug Investigations Bureau administers and enforces the Ordinance.   Permit applications to handle controlled chemicals, including those for the partial removal of chemicals while in transit, must be received by CCG at least 10 days prior to the proposed date of activity.  CCG uses this interim period to establish the bona fides of a proposed shipment, including through coordination with foreign counterparts via the Pre-Export Notification System.  Export permits are only issued upon receipt of “No Objection” letters from competent authorities in importing jurisdictions.  While Hong Kong does not control sales of over-the-counter medicines containing ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, CCG does investigate reports of possible diversion or parallel trading involving those substances.  Hong Kong supports international efforts to prevent illicit chemical diversion, though tends to be less engaged when chemicals transiting Hong Kong are not controlled in the territory.  India    India’s Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act (NDPS) provides the country’s legislative framework to implement precursor chemical control obligations required by the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  The Act requires control measures pertaining to finished pharmaceutical products as well as chemicals used to manufacture those products.    India regulates 19 of the 28 precursor substances scheduled in Tables I and II of the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Of the 19 substances, India’s NDPS Act designates five as “Schedule A” (i.e., subject to the most stringent controls): acetic anhydride; ephedrine; pseudoephedrine; n-acetylanthranilic acid; and anthranilic acid.  India continues to participate in international precursor control initiatives such as the INCB-led Project Cohesion and Project Prism.  Nevertheless, precursor chemical diversion from licit producers to illicit brokers remains a challenge.  India-based precursor trafficking organizations are involved in the illicit exportation and domestic sale of precursor chemicals such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, both of which are used in the manufacture of methamphetamine.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  67  To avoid Chinese controls on the export of precursors, DEA has observed entrepreneurs and dealers shift to India as their new source of supply for precursor chemicals and domestic production of drugs including fentanyl.  Multi-ton shipments of precursor materials from India have been shipped to Africa and Mexico.  This trend is expected to continue.     Republic of Korea (South Korea)  The Republic of Korea’s well-developed commercial infrastructure renders it an attractive location for criminals to obtain and transship precursor chemicals.  Precursor chemicals used to manufacture illicit drugs are imported from the United States, Japan, India, and China, and then either resold within South Korea or smuggled into other countries.  In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, South Korea imported approximately 38.25 MT of ephedrine, up from 28.5 MT in 2016, and approximately 37.75 MT of pseudoephedrine.  As of September 2018, Korean authorities controlled 33 precursor chemicals, two more than in 2016.  Acetic anhydride remains the chemical of greatest concern.  The Republic of Korea imports acetic anhydride for legitimate use, such as film production, cigarette filters, and other industrial and medical applications.  Law enforcement investigations have traced illicit acetic anhydride exports from South Korea to Pakistan and countries in the Middle East.   Both the Korea Customs Service and Ministry of Food and Drug Safety (MFDS) participate in INCB-led taskforces, including Projects Cohesion and Prism, which monitor imports of potassium permanganate and chemicals used to produce amphetamine-type stimulants.  Korean law enforcement authorities also cooperated with Southeast Asian nations to verify documents and confirm the identities of importing businesses, including by physical inspection.   The National Assembly passed a law in 2011 requiring manufacturers and exporters of precursor chemicals to register with the government.  The MFDS periodically provides training and updates to South Korean businesses to keep them from unknowingly exporting precursor chemicals to fraudulent importers.  Illegal precursor chemical shipments can be hidden by exploiting South Korean customs and chemical regulations.  Most chemicals are shipped by containerized cargo via ocean freighters.  The 1,000 kg reporting requirement threshold in the current regulations makes the Republic of Korea vulnerable to the “smurfing” of acetic anhydride – a diversion method in which smugglers make multiple small quantity purchases from different retail outlets to avoid detection, then combine them for shipment.  South Korean authorities work closely with U.S. counterparts to track suspect shipments.  Singapore    Singapore’s geographic advantage and robust port infrastructure contribute to its rank as one of the world’s top trade hubs, including for the trade of precursor chemicals.  The Government of Singapore continues to be a partner with the United States and other concerned countries in international chemical control initiatives to prevent the diversion of synthetic drug precursor chemicals, including ephedrine, pseudoephedrine and other essential primary chemicals, like potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride.  Singapore is one of the largest distributors of \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  68  acetic anhydride in Asia.  Used in film processing and the manufacture of plastics, pharmaceuticals, and industrial chemicals, acetic anhydride is also the primary acetylating agent for heroin.   Singapore does not produce ephedrine or pseudoephedrine; however, Singapore sees significant volumes of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine coming through its ports.  In 2017, Singapore exported approximately 21 MT of pseudoephedrine (down from 35.29 MT in 2016) and 6.55 MT of ephedrine (down from 8.78 MT in 2016).  Singapore imported approximately 23 MT of pseudoephedrine and 6.38 MT of ephedrine in 2017 (down from 37.6 MT and 10 MT in 2016).   Most of the ephedrine imported to Singapore originated from India and Taiwan, the bulk of which is then re-exported to Indonesia’s pharmaceutical companies.  The imported pseudoephedrine originates mostly from India, China, Germany, and Taiwan, and is also often re-exported to pharmaceutical companies in Indonesia.  Singapore also exports both chemicals to Vietnam, Cambodia, Malaysia, and Nepal for pharmaceutical purposes.  Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine that are not re-exported and remain in Singapore are used primarily by the domestic pharmaceutical industry.   In 2017, Singapore imported approximately 9.57 MT and exported 9.73 MT of acetic anhydride.  Singapore imported 23.5 MT and exported 5.26 MT of potassium permanganate.  Singapore uses potassium permanganate in the treatment of reclaimed water, rainwater, and seawater, which Singapore relies on for over 70 percent of its water supply.    Singapore imported 100 grams of phenyl-2-propanone in 2017.  Singapore did not export any phenyl-2-propanone in 2016.  Singapore did not import or export any ANPP and NPP, the two primary chemicals used to produce illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.  Since 2012, the Singapore Central Narcotics Bureau (CNB) had no diversion-related seizures of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.   The CNB is the competent authority in Singapore for the 1988 UN Drug Convention and is tasked with undertaking measures to prevent the diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  All imports, exports and transshipments of these controlled substances require a permit from the CNB, and supporting documentation must be kept by the companies for a minimum of two years and made available for inspection by the CNB.  Supporting documents may include invoice, sale contracts, and documentary proof from the competent authority of the exporting countries.  The movement of these controlled substances is also tracked and monitored by CNB.  If the permit application is approved, CNB will provide Pre-Export Notification or PEN-Online to the competent authority of the importing country for any exportation of substances.   Information on all goods imported and exported through Singapore’s borders must be provided in advance to enable Singapore Customs, the Immigration and Checkpoints Authority or other controlling agencies to facilitate legitimate and secured trade through measures such as timely pre-clearance risk assessment.  Singapore does not currently require advance cargo manifest information nor screen transshipments unless they involve conveyances from select countries of international concern, a Singapore consignee, or contain strategic or controlled items, including certain chemicals.  However, Singapore is conducting a three-year trial of the World Customs \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  69  Organization’s Cargo Targeting System that utilizes carriers’ electronic cargo manifest data including transshipments to identify high-risk shipments across a variety of threats.    Singapore solicited carriers to provide data on a voluntary basis; as of October 2018, 11 shipping lines were transmitting manifest data electronically, representing over 50 percent of the cargo shipments in Singapore.  In instances where precursor diversion for illicit drug manufacturing purposes was suspected, Singapore’s authorities have assisted foreign law enforcement agencies.  The Government of Singapore conducts site visits of companies dealing with controlled chemicals to ensure awareness of the requirements and overall compliance.   The Port of Singapore is the world's second busiest port in terms of shipping tonnage and is the world's busiest transshipment port.  Singapore’s authorities have never reported a diversion of precursor chemicals used in the manufacturing of methamphetamine from Singapore's pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and fine chemical industries, nor have they reported the seizure of any domestic clandestine methamphetamine laboratories.    Taiwan    The Taiwan Ministry of Economic Affairs Industrial Development Bureau imposes strict reporting requirements in tracking the production, distribution, sale, storage, and export/import of 25 of the 28 precursor chemicals scheduled under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  As of December 31, 2018, Taiwan’s government had not imposed controls over ANPP and NPP.  In January 2019, however, Taiwan’s Ministry of Justice initiated a process to control these chemicals.   Taiwan’s Food and Drug Administration (TFDA) supervises the trade and use of finished products containing ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and other chemicals under the Controlled Drugs Act, including by end-users such as hospitals.    Thailand    Thailand is not a major source country for drug precursors, nor are precursors widely imported into Thailand.  Domestic drug production is relatively limited.  The major drug threat to Thailand is finished product, such as crystal methamphetamine and methamphetamine tablets.   According to Thai authorities, most chemicals and precursors are imported for legitimate medical and industrial purposes.  For exports, Thai chemical companies sometimes do not adequately identify their potential customers and may not be fully aware of the intended use of chemical shipments.  The legal and regulatory framework for preventing the diversion of precursors is extensive and long-standing, beginning with the Commodity Control Act of 1952.  More recently, Order 32/2599 (2016) of the National Council for Peace and Order introduced new regulations to monitor the import, export, production, trafficking, and possession of precursors and chemicals.  Pre-export notification is conducted to mitigate diversion.  The Precursor Chemical Control Committee, which has been in place since 1993, formulates national strategy on precursor \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  70  control.  Thailand is compliant with the controlling chemicals listed under the 1998 UN Drug Convention.   In 2018, there were two noteworthy seizures of sodium cyanide totaling 18.5 MT.  Sodium cyanide is a non-regulated base chemical used to produce benzyl cyanide, which is a U.S. List I precursor chemical.  The chemicals were seized at the border, transiting through Thailand en route to Burma for possible use in methamphetamine production.  Although stable in-shipment, sodium cyanide produces deadly hydrogen cyanide vapor when mixed with an acid.    Europe    Chemical diversion control within the EU is based upon EU regulations binding on all 28 member states.  EU regulations meet the chemical control provisions of the 1988 UN Drug Convention, including provisions for record-keeping on transactions in controlled chemicals, a system of permits or declarations for exports and imports of regulated chemicals, and authority for governments to suspend chemical shipments.  EU regulations are updated regularly and directly applicable in all EU member states.    EU regulations establish common risk management rules to counter chemical diversion at the EU’s borders.  Member states are responsible for investigating and prosecuting violators.    The U.S.-EU Chemical Control Agreement, signed May 28, 1997, is the formal basis for U.S. cooperation with the EU and its member states in chemical control through enhanced regulatory cooperation and mutual assistance.  The agreement calls for annual meetings of a Joint Follow-up Group to review implementation of the agreement and to coordinate positions in other areas, such as national or joint positions on chemical control matters before larger multilateral fora, including the CND.    In December 2013, the EU adopted new basic legislation that strengthens controls on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, and tightens controls on companies in the EU using acetic anhydride.    For external trade, the change strengthened controls on medicinal products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine exported from or transiting through the EU.  The EU developed a new category of scheduled substances (Category 4), imposed mandatory export authorization and pre-export notification, and extended enforcement power to stop and seize cargo if there is “reasonable doubt” concerning the shipment.  For trade within EU territory, compulsory registration of end-users for acetic anhydride was introduced by creating a new subcategory (2A).  Additionally, a definition of “user” was added for natural or legal persons possessing substances for purposes other than placing them in the market.    Other amendments to the regulation to facilitate tracking and enforcement include: clarifying definitions for scheduled substance and natural products; strengthening the rules for licensing and registration by introducing explicit criteria for granting or refusing licenses and registrations; increasing the power of competent authorities to control non-scheduled substances; implementing a quick reaction mechanism to add new chemicals to the list of scheduled \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  71  substances via the so-called 'catch-all'-provision; and developing an EU database on drug precursors, and improving data protection provisions.    In 2015, a Commission Delegated Regulation and a Commission Implementing Regulation entered into force (replacing previous implementation legislation).  These regulations complete the revision of the EU drug precursor legislation that started at the end of 2013.  However, the EU is currently carrying out an evaluation of the EU drug precursor legislation. This is expected to be finalized by the end of 2019.  If needed, the EU may introduce amendments to its drug precursor legislation.  Additionally, on November 23, 2018, the EU introduced new legislation for a quick response to public health and social threats against NPS.  The new legislation intends to strengthen the EU Early Warning System and risk assessment procedures on NPS and shortens control processes.   Bilateral chemical control cooperation continues between the United States and the EU as well as its member states.  Many EU member states participate in voluntary initiatives such as Project Cohesion and Project Prism.  In 2007, the EU established guidelines for private sector operators involved in trading in precursor chemicals, with a view to offering practical guidance on the implementation of the main provisions of EU legislation on precursor chemicals, in particular the prevention of illegal diversion.  These guidelines, now titled “Guidelines for Operators – Drug Precursors' Control in the EU,” have been updated in 2017.    Germany    Germany continues to be a leading manufacturer of legal pharmaceuticals and chemicals that can be used to produce illicit drugs.  According to the most recent available data from 2017, Germany was one of the largest global exporters of ephedrine (20.6 MT) and pseudoephedrine (259.1 MT), as reported by the Global Trade Atlas (GTA) database, which relies on statistics from the European Commission Statistics Office (Eurostat).  Most of the 28 scheduled precursors under international control and listed in Tables I and II of the 1988 UN Drug Convention are manufactured and/or sold by the German chemical and pharmaceutical industry.   Germany’s National Precursor Monitoring Act complies with EU regulations. Germany has a highly developed chemical sector, which is tightly controlled through a combination of national and EU regulations, law enforcement action, and voluntary industry compliance.  Cooperation between the chemical and pharmaceutical industry, merchants, and German authorities is a key element in Germany’s chemical control strategy.    Germany works closely with the UNODC, and is an active participant in chemical control initiatives led by the INCB, including Project Prism and Project Cohesion.  The United States works closely with Germany’s chemical regulatory agency, the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices, on chemical control issues and exchanges bilateral information to promote transnational chemical control initiatives.  German agencies cooperate closely with their U.S. counterparts to identify and stop chemical precursor diversion.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  72  The Netherlands    The Netherlands has a large chemical industry with large chemical storage facilities, and Rotterdam serves as a major chemical shipping port.  The Netherlands has strong legislation and regulatory controls over the industry, and law enforcement authorities track domestic shipments and work closely with international partners.  Trade in precursor chemicals is governed by the 1995 Act on the Prevention of Misuse of Chemicals to Prevent Abuse of Chemical Substances (WVMC), which aims to prevent the diversion of legal chemicals.  Parliament approved minor legislative changes October 9, 2018, to bring the WVMC in line with changes in EU Regulation.  Chemical substances are also governed under The Act on Economic Offences and the Opium Act, and EU regulations.   Production of synthetic drugs is significant in the Netherlands.  Recent trends show an increase in new types of precursors and pre-precursors to circumvent national and international legislation.  APAAN is used in amphetamine production and acetic anhydride is used as a pre-precursor for benzyl methyl ketone (BMK).  Safrole continues to be used as a pre-precursor for piperonyl methyl ketone (PMK), though availability has decreased since 2014.  The main (pre-) precursors used in the Netherlands are APAA, PMK, and BMK-glycidates.   In recent years, law enforcement, especially in the south, reinforced its efforts to combat synthetic drugs and pre-precursors.    The Financial Investigation Service (FIOD) of the Ministry of Finance oversees implementation of the WVMC and has responsibility for law enforcement efforts targeting precursors.  Customs monitors the trade and production of chemicals.   The chemical industry is legally obliged to report suspicious transactions.  The Netherlands abides by all EU regulations for drug precursors.  The Netherlands an active participant and an initiator of the INCB-led Project Prism taskforce.  The Dutch government also continues to work closely with the United States on precursor chemical controls and investigations.  The Netherlands has had a memorandum of understanding with China since 2004 concerning chemical precursor investigations.   The Netherlands requires a license for the manufacture and trade of ephedrine.  Relevant reports on suspicious transactions are shared nationally and internationally.  The Netherlands also monitors a number of non-registered substances used in the production of methamphetamine.    Poland   Poland is both a transit country for drug trafficking and the source of production of synthetic drugs for Western European markets.  Poland is one of the major source countries of amphetamine-type stimulants in the European market, and in recent years the production of methamphetamine has also emerged.  The manufacturing process and the distribution of illicit drugs are handled by organized criminal syndicates, which establish, equip, and supply clandestine laboratories.  Polish police have reported changes in the modus operandi of criminal \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  73  groups, which have started to divide amphetamine manufacturing into stages.  These production stages take place in various locations, which tend to change frequently.  The 2005 Act on Counteracting Drug Addiction prohibits the production, import, and marketing of precursor chemicals in Poland.  The State Sanitary Inspector exercises supervision over compliance with this prohibition.  The division of roles and responsibilities for drug and chemical controls in Poland are delineated in a 2011 Memorandum of Understanding between the Chief Sanitary Inspector, Commander of the National Police, Customs Service Chief, and Chief Pharmaceutical Inspector.  The memorandum lists the goals of the memorandum; general provisions; and applicable laws, procedures, and protocols for each entity, as well as information sharing agreements.   Poland’s precursor chemical controls are governed by a number of national anti-drug laws, which also implement UN and EU requirements on chemical controls.  Most recently, updated anti-drug regulations came into force, namely the Act of July 20, 2018, which amended the 2005 Act on Counteracting Drug Addiction and the Act on the State Sanitary Inspection, as well as the August 17, 2018, law regarding the Health Ministry’s list of psychotropic substances, intoxicants and NPS.  These recent amendments aim to strengthen the scope of NPS risk assessments, due to their growing availability.  The Ministry of Health’s State Sanitary Inspector and State Pharmaceutical Inspector are the lead entities in implementing drug and chemical controls.  The State Sanitary Inspector is in charge of controls for category 2 and 3 drug precursors (such as permanganate and acetic anhydride), and supervises manufacturing, importation, and commercial entities associated with handling these substances.  The State Pharmaceutical Inspector is the competent authority in controlling category one drug precursors (such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine) and supervises manufacturing, importation, and commercial entities associated with handling these substances.  In situations of possible illegal handling of said precursors, the relevant Chief Inspectors notify the Central Bureau of Investigation Police (CBŚP).  In 2015, an amendment to the 2001 Pharmaceutical Law came into force, restricting the sale of over-the-counter medical products containing psychoactive substances (including pseudoephedrine).  According to the September 6, 2001, Pharmaceutical Law, manufacturers, importers, and distributors of pharmaceutical substances must be an approved business entity on Poland’s National Register of manufacturers, importers, and distributors of active substances, run by the State Pharmaceutical Inspector.  A business entity wanting to enter the market must apply for a license, and the State Pharmaceutical Inspector will conduct an inspection of the business entity within 60 days.  If approved, the business entity can be registered and begin operating.  The State Pharmaceutical Inspector conducts control audits on all registered entities every three years thereafter.  Poland’s National Registry complies with EU-Directive 2011/62/EU relating to medicinal products for human use.    Polish law enforcement activities are mainly focused on the detection and prevention of the illegal production of synthetic stimulants, including the control of precursors and pre-precursors.  These activities are coordinated by the Central Bureau of Investigation Police (CBŚP), in close cooperation with the State Sanitary Service.  In 2016, police reportedly dismantled 24 \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  74  laboratories: 18 for the production of amphetamine; three for methamphetamine; two for mephedrone; and one producing an NPS (4-CMC).  In July 2017, CBŚP, in cooperation with the State Sanitary Inspection, dismantled a laboratory producing 4-chlorometcatinone (4-CMC), seizing a total of 128 kg of substances in various stages of production, including over 56 kg of finished product.  While retail shops selling NPS are actively identified and shut down, challenges persist with online sellers of NPS within Poland.  The State Sanitary Inspectorate have also found difficulties in prosecuting transnational crimes outside the EU concerning illegal chemical product trade through e-commerce.   The Republic of Poland enters information into the PEN system for all exports and imports of drug precursors.  This information is forwarded to the International Narcotics Control Board by the Main Pharmaceutical Inspector in cooperation with the Chief Sanitary Inspector.   Switzerland    The Government of Switzerland continues to be a strong partner with the United States and other concerned countries in international chemical control initiatives to prevent the diversion of synthetic drug precursor chemicals, including ephedrine and pseudoephedrine, and other primarily essential chemicals, including potassium permanganate and acetic anhydride.  Switzerland is a significant importer and exporter of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.    In 2017, according to the most recent available U.S. data, Switzerland imported approximately 70.94 MT of pseudoephedrine (2nd largest importer) and 1.8 MT of ephedrine (19th largest importer).  Switzerland exported approximately 47.3 MT of pseudoephedrine (4th largest exporter) and 178 kg of ephedrine (5th largest exporter) during the same period.  Data from Swiss Customs shows negligible differences in the amounts listed above, with the exception of ephedrine imports, which Swiss Customs data lists at just 176 kg for 2017.  Swiss control measures concerning precursor chemicals such as ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are governed by the Federal Narcotics Control Ordinance and the Federal Department of Home Affairs’ Ordinance on the Directory of Narcotics.  The Ordinances require importers and exporters of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to obtain a license from Swissmedic, Switzerland’s relevant regulatory authority, and require chemical manufacturers to provide “end user” certificates.  To more effectively deter illegal dissemination of these precursor chemicals, regulations were enacted in October 2017 requiring a license and “end user” certificates for import or export of preparations containing these precursor chemicals.  In 2018, there were no significant changes reported to Swiss legislation regarding import and export of these substances.  Switzerland participates in multilateral chemical control initiatives led by the INCB, including Project Prism and Project Cohesion.  Switzerland also participates in the International Import and Export Authorization System (I2ES), which facilitates effective implementation of import and export authorization systems for legal international trade in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  75  Swiss law enforcement agencies have established close cooperation with the Swiss chemical manufacturing and trading industries and counterparts in major chemical manufacturing and trading countries.  This cooperation includes information exchanges in support of chemical control programs and in the investigation of diversion attempts.  Cooperation between U.S. and Swiss law enforcement agencies on chemical control related issues is excellent, particularly with the Swiss Federal Criminal Police.   The United Kingdom    The UK is a leading producer of precursor chemicals commonly used to manufacture illicit drugs.  However, because the UK applies a strict regulatory regime to control the production and trade of precursor chemicals, only relatively small amounts of these chemicals are believed to be diverted for illicit use.  Between January 2017 and early 2018, the UK Border Force seized over two metric tons of precursor chemicals destined for northwest England intended for the illicit manufacture of amphetamine-type stimulants and methamphetamine.  Law enforcement authorities estimate that this volume of chemicals had the potential to produce as much as two metric tons of unadulterated amphetamine sulphate, with an estimated street value of over $51 million.  The United States and United Kingdom cooperate closely in international bodies to promote global regulation of precursor chemical.      Middle East    Egypt  Egypt oversees the import and export of all internationally-recognized chemicals through a committee composed of the Ministry of Interior (ANGA), Ministry of Finance (Customs), and Ministry of Health (Pharmaceutical).  This committee approves or denies requests to import or export chemicals.  Over the past few years, there was a spike in the importation of ephedrine.  With the large amounts of ephedrine imported relative to the population of Egypt, it is possible that not all of it is used for legitimate medicinal production.  However, the Egyptian government has not reported any large scale diversion of ephedrine or observed any increase in the use of methamphetamine.    During 2018, there was an increase in the amount of tramadol seized by the Egyptian government at the ports.  There was also an increase in the amount of heroin smuggled into the country, as well as a rise in new drugs combining aromatic plants – such as marjoram or incense – infused with synthetic cannabinoids up to 100 times as powerful as natural marijuana.     United Arab Emirates  The United Arab Emirates (UAE) is a major cargo transshipment point, and therefore an ideal transit point for precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs.  UAE chemical controls and customs regulations are based on international conventions, Gulf Cooperation Council guidelines, and local laws and ordinances.  In the UAE, the Ministry of Health (MOH), Ministry of Climate Change and Environment, and the Export Control Executive Office are responsible for the licensing of export and transshipment of controlled chemicals.  UAE authorities adhere to \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  76  UN conventions related to the shipment of chemical precursors and other commodities through established licensing procedures.      According to UAE Ministerial Decree No. 1986 issued in 1995, the MOH must approve the import of chemicals listed in the 1988 UN Drug Convention, which includes ANPP, NPP, potassium permanganate, and acetic anhydride.  The UAE signed onto and implemented the convention in May 1990 with publication in the official gazette.  According to the 2015 GCC Unified Guide for Customs Procedures at First Points of Entry, shipments of restricted goods must include approvals and authorizations from the competent authorities.  These shipments must also include the Harmonized System codes for hazardous goods and chemicals on the packing list.    In August 2007, the UAE government enacted Federal Law Number 13 of 2007, which bans the export or re-export of certain strategic and controlled items and established penalties for parties involved in the diversion of controlled shipments, including chemical and biological materials.  The law authorizes government bodies to restrict or ban the import, export, or re-export of goods deemed a threat to UAE national security, foreign policy, natural resources, public health and safety, or the environment.    On January 7, 2018, the MOH issued a ministerial decree updating the list of banned medications, narcotics, and psychotropic drugs.  The MOH cited concerns over individuals importing large quantities of controlled drugs potentially destined for resale rather than personal use.  Pharmacy law No. 4 of 1983 and Narcotics Law No. 14 of 1995 warn travelers entering the UAE against bringing in controlled or psychotropic medicines and illegal narcotics.  On February 10, 2018, the Anti-Narcotics Council approved strategic indicators for combatting drugs in order to intensify drug enforcement efforts.    Transshipment of methamphetamine and cocaine precursors is virtually non-existent in UAE ports.  However, the UAE is a crossroads for methamphetamine from Iran, heroin from Afghanistan, and cocaine from Latin America, in the form of finished product.  Traffickers generally prefer to use larger ports in order to increase the odds of evading detection due to the large shipping volume at such ports.  Dubai’s Jebel Ali Port is the largest container port in the Middle East and the ninth largest in the world, with a total volume of 15.4 million twenty-foot equivalent units (TEU) in 2017 and capacity of approximately 20 million TEU.  The Dubai Airport Free Zone (DAFZA) and Dubai International Airport Cargo Gateway, formerly Dubai Cargo Village, handled 1.74 million tons of freight in 2017 and the Al Maktoum Airport (DWC) 972,295 tons of air cargo in 2017.  Significant Illicit Drug Manufacturing Countries    This section is also broken down by region and focuses on illicit drug manufacturing countries, their chemical control policies, and related efforts.    Asia    Afghanistan    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  77   Inadequate border security and weak enforcement capacity hamper control of precursor chemicals in Afghanistan.    Both acetic anhydride and ammonium nitrate are illegal in Afghanistan and have no legitimate uses.  Hydrochloric acid, acetone, and sulfuric acid are controlled substances and subject to seizure for other reasons, such as customs violations.  Ammonium chloride is not illegal, but if found at a laboratory site, Afghan authorities seize and destroy it.  Since 2013, the United States has supported the UNODC Container Control Program (CCP) to develop units in Kabul and at key ports of entry on Afghanistan’s borders with Pakistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan, and Iran.  Through training and assistance, CCP promotes effective container controls to prevent drug trafficking and other illicit activities and to facilitate legitimate trade.  The program enables effective information sharing with other countries participating in CCP, especially the neighboring Central Asian states.  The Precursor Control Unit (PCU) of the Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan is a specialized unit devoted to combating the precursor problem.  Afghanistan uses the INCB’s PICS to enhance information sharing between national authorities on precursor incidents.  The PCU communicates directly with the Central Asian Regional Information and Coordination Center for Combating Illicit Trafficking of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and their Precursors as well as the Pre-Export Notification system.  Beginning in early 2016, the United States funded capacity building for regional PCU staff through a UNODC training program.  Afghanistan maintains a Drug Regulation Committee (DRC) to monitor and regulate the licit precursor chemical trade.  The DRC licenses chemicals for licit use and stores data on the use of chemicals so authorities can better understand emerging trends.  The DRC also authorizes investigations and spot checks on companies importing chemicals.    Burma    The illicit production and export of synthetic drugs in Burma continued to increase in 2018, and Shan State has become the locus of synthetic drug production in the region.  The fact that Burma does not have a major chemical industry and does not manufacture the precursor chemicals necessary to produce heroin and ATS on an industrial scale indicates the sheer volume of essential and precursor chemicals smuggled into the country from elsewhere.      Organized criminal syndicates transport precursor chemicals into Burma across porous borders primarily from China, and to a lesser degree from Thailand and India.  The precursor chemicals are then diverted to clandestine laboratories and refineries in regions of northern and eastern Shan State that are under the control of armed ethnic groups or militias.  Recent record-breaking seizures along the Burmese-Thai border indicate the establishment of numerous clandestine laboratories in key transit towns on the Burmese side of the border.  The best available information suggests that significant methamphetamine production takes place in clandestine laboratories that operate in the Wa Self-Administered Division in Shan State.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  78  The Supervision Committee for the Control of Precursor Chemicals, which functions within the Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC), monitors the possession, use, sale, production, and transportation of chemical precursors.  Importers of licit chemicals are required to use a pre-import notification system to obtain a certificate of verification from the CCDAC, and retailers must also apply for a certificate to transport chemicals across and within Burma’s borders.  After the Committee added two precursors (ANPP and NPP) in 2017, there are now 28 identified precursor chemicals prohibited for import, sale or use in Burma.     However, authorities faced overwhelming challenges that fundamentally limited their ability to control the illicit import and diversion of precursor chemicals for use in the production of illegal narcotics.  The most significant of these challenges involve extremely porous borders, particularly those portions of the border in eastern Shan State that are not under government control.  A UNODC finding showed that 70 percent of law enforcement officials in border areas had not received any specialized training to police cross-border crimes, nor any training on how to conduct presumptive drug and precursor tests in the field.  During the first nine months of 2018, Burmese authorities reported seizing 450,000 tablets of pseudoephedrine; 18.66 metric tons of caffeine powder; 47,787 liters of sulfuric acid; 165,733 liters of hydrochloric acid; 190,578.25 liters of ethyl ether; and 75,450.15 liters of sodium hydroxide.  Burma is a party to the 1988 UN Drug Convention, but has not instituted laws to meet all of the UN chemical control provisions.  The United States funds UNODC’s support for Border Liaison Offices to strengthen border management.  This program includes capacity-building trainings for frontline officers on effective uses of field test kits, training-of-trainers courses, and delivery of field test kits.  UNODC, also with U.S. support, hosted a High-Level Asia Regional Conference on Precursor Control in November 2018.  Heads of law enforcement agencies from ASEAN and neighboring countries shared information and discussed steps needed to establish a coordinated response to precursor chemical diversion and trafficking in the Asia-Pacific region.  Indonesia  Indonesia’s 2009 National Narcotics Law gave the country’s National Narcotics Board of Republic of Indonesia (BNN) the authority to monitor narcotics and precursor production at pharmaceutical plants, and to conduct investigations and arrests in response to precursor and narcotics violations.  Although there were several laws and regulations regarding the import and export of precursor chemicals, the extent of enforcement was largely unknown.    Regarding the two most widely sought-after precursor chemicals used for cocaine and heroin production – potassium permanganate (cocaine) and acetic anhydride (heroin) – the United States was unaware of a single seizure in 2018 by Indonesian law enforcement.  BNN reported that it regularly conducts unannounced inspections to companies that are listed importers of precursor chemicals.  In the past year, BNN hired an additional 300 personnel.    Every year, through the Ministry of Health, Indonesia reports estimates of its legal domestic narcotics precursors to the International Narcotics Control Board.  The bulk of precursors comes \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  79  in via ocean routes from China, Taiwan, and India; however, Indonesia is not a prime destination for precursors, as the vast majority of illegal narcotics is not manufactured within country.     Pakistan    Pakistan is a destination and transshipment point for diverted shipments of acetic anhydride and other precursor chemicals used in the production of heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants.  Pakistan does not domestically produce industrial-scale quantities of either acetic anhydride or ephedrine, though it has chemical and pharmaceutical industries with a legitimate, albeit modest, demand for these substances.    Pakistan enforces a basic precursor control regime as part of its obligations under the UN drug control conventions, covering the import of seven multi-use chemicals: acetic anhydride; pseudoephedrine; anthranilic acid; acetone; potassium permanganate; methyl-ethyl ketone; and toluene.  The country’s Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF) is charged with managing precursor control and does so largely by conducting ground checks on importing businesses, licensing those businesses, and reviewing Pre-Export Notifications (PENs) requesting the sale of these substances within Pakistan.  Besides ANF, 15 federal and provincial agencies share responsibility for chemical control throughout the country.  Per UN Commission on Narcotic Drugs Resolution 49/3, ANF established two review committees to manage the precursor control mechanism, the Committee for Granting Non Objection Certificates to Companies and Firms for Use of Precursor Chemicals and the Committee for Quota Allocation to Pharmaceutical Companies.     During the first nine months of 2018, ANF received 63 PENs, approving 54 and denying nine.  It is likely that significant imports of precursor chemicals circumvent the PENs system via mislabeled shipping containers and by maritime smuggling along Pakistan’s coastline.  During the first nine months of 2018, ANF reported seizing 4,283 liters of acetic anhydride.     In 2018, both ANF and Pakistani Customs continued to submit information via the International Narcotics Control Board Precursor Incident Communication System, which distributes real-time information on precursor seizures to law enforcement agencies worldwide.    The Andean Region    Bolivia    Bolivia’s government passed a Controlled Substances Law in March 2017 that schedules precursor chemicals in coordination with the International Narcotic Control Board.  Precursor chemicals continue to be diverted through black market channels into Bolivia for processing cocaine.  According to the Chemical Substances Investigations Group (GISUQ) of the Bolivian counterdrug police (FELCN), the majority of these chemicals come from Brazil, Argentina and Chile.  The most common chemicals seized as contraband match those commonly found in drug factories (where base paste is prepared) and cocaine labs (where base paste is transformed into \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  80  cocaine HCl).  In addition to serving as a transit country for illicit drug shipments, Bolivia is also a source country for coca and cocaine processing.  The number of labs within Bolivia that process Peruvian base paste and Bolivian base paste into cocaine has significantly increased over the last five years.  The most common chemicals found in cocaine factories and labs are sulfuric acid; hydrochloric acid; sodium carbonate; caustic soda; phenacetin; sodium metabisulfite; activated carbon; ethyl acetate; and levamisole.  The last five products are not listed as controlled substances under Bolivian law, and GISUQ believes they are alternative chemicals that drug producers use to avoid law enforcement controls.  Traffickers use activated carbon to deodorize and discolor water and other liquids, and phenacetin, a highly toxic analgesic, is used to increase the volume of cocaine.  The GISUQ is charged with locating and interdicting chemicals used in the traditional cocaine process, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid, and gasoline.  The GISUQ coordinates activities with the General Directorate for Controlled Substances, a civilian entity under the Government of Bolivia that administers and licenses the commercialization and transport of controlled substances listed under Bolivian domestic law.  Under the Controlled Substances Law, violation of controlled substances could result in penal action against all participants, a change from the old law wherein unlicensed transport and commercialization generated only an administrative violation.  The new law provides the legal framework for GISUQ, in coordination with other agencies, to add or eliminate chemical substances controlled under Bolivian law.  The Bolivian government does not have control regimes for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.  The GISUQ, however, coordinates with the Ministry of Health to supervise and interdict illegal commercialization of methamphetamine.  In September 2016, the Ministry of Health created the State Agency of Medicines and Health Technologies to regulate the use and commercialization of synthetic drugs.  In 2018, the GISUQ seized 236.8 MT of solid substances and 597,210 liters of liquid precursor chemicals.     Colombia    Precursor chemical diversion in Colombia is a serious problem that the government is working to address.  The Colombian government has tightened controls on coca-processing chemicals, though traffickers still are able to import them illicitly into Colombia.  Colombian police and military forces have stepped up enforcement efforts.  The Ministry of Justice reported that during the first nine months of 2018, the Colombian National Police (CNP) and military forces seized 18,681 MT of solid precursors and 3,815,216 gallons of liquid precursors.  The Colombian government controls the import and distribution of chemicals needed for processing coca leaves into cocaine, such as sulfuric acid, hydrochloride acid, and potassium permanganate, as well as cement.  It limits production, distribution, and storage of precursors nationwide and prohibits gasoline and other chemicals in certain zones.  Additionally, Colombian companies are not authorized to export ephedrine or pseudoephedrine in bulk form.  Colombian law bans all pharmaceutical products containing ephedrine or pseudoephedrine from domestic distribution.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  81   Since 2015, the government has focused on regulating essential chemicals for drug production and has expanded its enforcement efforts related to these chemicals.  Also in 2015, the government began implementing the Information System for the Control of Substances and Chemical Products (SICOQ), a tracking tool that the CNP and the Ministry of Justice developed to strengthen the control of chemicals in real time.  In October 2018, more than 5,811 companies were registered in the platform, which allows the government to track the movement of chemicals.  However, of the over 5000 registered companies, only 3,330 have valid government-issued authorizations for the legal use of controlled substances and chemical products as of October 26, 2018.  The remainder either have not yet been inspected or must provide additional information regarding their use of chemicals in their businesses.  While the Colombian government has strengthened chemical-control legislation, traffickers are still able to camouflage precursors to import them clandestinely into Colombia.  Although chemical companies require government permission to import or export specific chemicals and controlled substances, the CNP have the burden to prove seized chemicals were intended for illicit drug production.  Further, to bring U.S. charges against an illicit chemical trafficker, the CNP must be able to prove that the trafficker had knowledge that the chemicals seized were going to produce drugs that would end up in the United States.  Additionally, traffickers and clandestine laboratories recycle controlled chemicals and replace controlled chemicals with non-controlled chemicals.  The CNP created a special unit specifically tasked with the interdiction of precursor chemicals.  The Colombian Marines have also increased their efforts against precursor chemicals traveling via rivers, particularly in the Department of Nariño, the department that produces the most coca and cocaine in Colombia.  Nariño has over 745 miles of rivers and few roads connecting it to the rest of the country, making the riverine route the most attractive option for precursor traffickers.  Recognizing this challenge, the Colombian Marines have increased the operational tempo on the rivers to better cover riverine chokepoints, areas through which traffickers must cross to move illicit chemicals.  Peru    Peru is a producer and major importer of chemicals essential to cocaine production.  Chemicals are principally imported into Peru licitly by wholesalers through the Port of Callao and are later diverted for illicit purposes by smaller actors for cocaine production.  Peru requires all chemical sector entities to obtain a license.  Peru’s authority to regulate the precursor chemicals used in illicit drug production is based on Legislative Decree 1126 and the regulation set forth in Supreme Decree 010-2015EF, which establish protocols for sanctions and fines related to the chemical industry.  However, Supreme Decree 010-2015EF is not effectively enforced.  The National Superintendence of Tax Administration (SUNAT) is the regulatory agency handling all issues related to the chemical industry, but SUNAT does not have law enforcement powers and is limited to investigative activities.  SUNAT coordinates with the Peruvian National Police (PNP) to combat diversion of precursor chemicals. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  82   The PNP’s Precursor Chemical Unit, DEPCIQ, reported an increase in PNP seizures of precursor chemicals over the first nine month of 2018 in comparison to the same period in 2017 – from 7,826 MT in 2017 to 8,199 MT.  Peru continued to implement the 2015 Precursor Chemicals Initiative to cover approximately 70 percent of roads in the VRAEM, the Peru-Bolivia border, as well as the Junín, Ayacucho, and Lima regions, utilizing 12 backscatter x-ray scanners in strategic corridor routes.  Alleged corruption within SUNAT and the PNP fosters mistrust between the entities, leading to an unwillingness by either to share investigative information related to precursor chemicals.    The Ministry of Health manages estimates of Peru’s INCB licit demand for ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.  The Ministry’s Health Department does not have a regulatory or enforcement arm to prevent the diversion of chemicals.  According to INCB records, Peru does not have strict controls to prevent the diversion of ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, and P-2-P.  Indications suggest that ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are entering the country in larger quantities than required by the INCB assessment.    Major Exporters and Importers of Pseudoephedrine and Ephedrine (Section 722, Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act “CMEA”)    This section of the INCSR is produced in response to the CMEA’s Section 722 requirement to report on the five major importing and exporting countries of the identified methamphetamine precursor chemicals.  In meeting the CMEA requirements, the Department of State and DEA considered the chemicals involved and the available data on their export, import, worldwide production, and the known legitimate demand.  The available data does not address illicit trafficking and production.    Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine are no longer the preferred chemicals for methamphetamine production shipped to the United States, since traffickers are increasingly using substitutes or pre-precursors.  The phenomenon of substitute chemicals used in methamphetamine production is particularly observed in Mexico, where the nitrostyrene method is used to produce P-2-P, which starts from benzaldehyde and nitroethane, or from the intermediary product 1-phenyl-2-nitropropene, and in Europe, where the method using APAAN, are largely used.  Phenylpropanolamine, a third chemical listed in the CMEA, is not a methamphetamine precursor, although it can be used as an amphetamine precursor.    In 2000, the FDA issued warnings concerning significant health risks associated with phenylpropanolamine.  As a result, phenylpropanolamine is no longer approved for human consumption.  Phenylpropanolamine is still imported for veterinary medicines, and for the conversion to amphetamine for the legitimate manufacture of pharmaceutical products.  Phenylpropanolamine is not a methamphetamine precursor chemical, and trade and production data are not available on phenylpropanolamine.  Therefore, this section provides information only on ephedrine and pseudoephedrine.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  83  The Global Trade Atlas (GTA), compiled by Global Trade Information Services, Inc. (WWW.GTIS.COM), provides export and import data for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine collected from major trading countries.  However, given the reporting cycles by participating countries, data often lags behind one year.  The most recent year for which full-year data is available is 2017.  The data, including data from the previous year, is continually revised as countries review and revise their data.  GTA data analysis and a chart identifying the sources of the data are presented in the tables at the end of this section.     During the preparation of the 2018 CMEA report, GTA data for U.S. exports and imports for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for calendar years 2014-2016 were updated in light of revised estimates provided by DEA.  For the 2019 CMEA report, GTA data for U.S. exports and imports for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for calendar years 2015-2017 were also updated in light of revised estimates provided by DEA.    Obtaining data on legitimate demand also remains problematic.  Such data is still not sufficient to enable any accurate estimates of diversion, or to comply with the economic and compliance analyses required by the CMEA report.  There are significant numbers of countries that have yet to report regularly to the INCB on their reasonable estimates about the trade in the end products that form the basis of legitimate demand – although each year the number of countries reporting increases.    Nevertheless, many countries do not report trade in ephedrine and pseudoephedrine when it is incorporated into a finished pharmaceutical product, in the form of finished dosage units such as liquids, tablets, and capsules, due to concerns that this type of information is commercially sensitive.  Further challenges include governments that may not be able to ascertain this data if, for example, they do not subject pharmaceutical preparations to national control, or if a different ministry with different or less stringent means of oversight regulates preparations versus bulk chemicals.    Ephedrine and pseudoephedrine pharmaceutical products are not specifically listed chemicals under the 1988 UN Drug Convention.  Therefore, reporting licit market trade and demand for ephedrine and pseudoephedrine as well pharmaceutical products derived from them is voluntary.  Even so, the trend toward better reporting has been positive.    Thus far, the economic analysis required by the CMEA remains challenging because of outdated, insufficient, and unreliable data.  Often the collection and reporting of such data requires a regulatory infrastructure that is beyond the means of some governments.  It is also important to note that not all countries are familiar with the methodology and data sources used by the GTA to report the final numbers and some countries dispute the accuracy of the data.  This increases the difficulty of comparing import or export totals across years.  Itt remains challenging to determine with precision the top-five countries exporting and importing the largest amount of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine.   Nevertheless, the United States will continue to urge countries in diplomatic and technical fora – in both bilateral and multilateral settings – to provide reporting on their licit domestic requirements for methamphetamine precursor chemicals to the INCB.  The United States will \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1     Chemical Controls  84  also continue to work with the INCB and with authorities in the reporting countries to secure explanations for anomalies between reported imports and reported licit domestic requirements, and to follow the development of other chemicals used in the production of methamphetamine.   This report provides export and import figures for both ephedrine and pseudoephedrine for calendar years 2015-2017.  The report illustrates the wide annual shifts that can occur in some countries, reflecting such commercial factors as demand, pricing, and inventory buildup.  GTA data on U.S. exports and imports have been included to indicate the importance of the United States in international pseudoephedrine and ephedrine trade.  Complete data on the worldwide production of pseudoephedrine and ephedrine are not available because major producers will not release this proprietary data.    CMEA Trade data.

According to the Global Trade Atlas (GTA) database, ephedrine exports increase 20.24 percent in 2017, due to a substantial increase in exports from Italy and China.  India’s exports had a 10.22 percent decrease; going from 80,274 kg in 2016 to 72,829 kg in 2017.  The country continues to rank as the top global exporter of ephedrine for this year’s report.  Italy increased its export from 567 kg in 2016 to 32,824 in 2017, a 98.27 percent increase.  The reason for this increase in unknown.  China now appears as the fourth top exporter of ephedrine, going from 3,259 kg in 2016 to 10,963 kg in 2016; a 70.27 percent increase.  The top-five economies in 2016 were:  India, Germany, the UK, Singapore, and Switzerland.

Introduction  Afghanistan remains the dominant source of the world’s illicit opiate supply.  The insurgency and widespread corruption present major challenges to the central government’s efforts to establish the physical and economic security necessary to bring the illicit drug trade under control.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) and the Afghan Ministry of Counter Narcotics (MCN) estimate the total area under opium poppy cultivation in Afghanistan for the 2018 season to be approximately 262,673 hectares (ha).  This is a decrease of 20 percent in area under cultivation compared with 2017, due largely to an ongoing drought and lower market prices.  Afghan opium is typically refined into heroin or morphine in Afghanistan or neighboring countries for export.    A symbiotic relationship exists between the insurgency and illicit drug trafficking.  Traffickers provide weapons, funding, and material support to the insurgency in exchange for protection.  Some insurgents traffic drugs or tax their production and transportation to finance their operations.  However, trafficking is not limited to insurgent-controlled areas.  The drug trade is also a primary driver of corruption, which undermines governance and rule of law throughout Afghanistan.   Afghanistan suffers from widespread illicit drug use.  The U.S.-supported 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey profiling urban, rural, and national drug use conservatively estimated that roughly 11 percent of the population tested positive for one or more drugs, including 5.3 percent of the urban population and 13 percent of the rural population.  Drug use by women and children is among the highest documented worldwide, and 38.5 percent of rural households tested positive for some form of illicit drug.  These figures portend a massive health crisis that Afghans are gradually acknowledging.    Senior Afghan government officials state that the government recognizes the deleterious impact of illegal drugs and is attempting to address the problem, citing the 2015 adoption of the National Drug Action Plan (NDAP) as proof.  Despite public displays of support for this comprehensive national drug control strategy, the Afghan government has been slow to implement it.  The Afghan government will require financial and technical assistance from the international community for the foreseeable future to achieve the NDAP’s objectives.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1. Institutional Development  The Afghan government is publicly committed to confronting the drug problem in Afghanistan, focusing particularly on what it identifies as the underlying root causes of the drug economy, including instability, poverty, organized crime, and lack of economic opportunity.  MCN is the lead agency for developing drug control policy and coordinating related government activities.  As part of President Ashraf Ghani’s reform agenda, the Afghan National Unity Government (GNU) has pledged “to intensify efforts to control narcotic production and sale.”  MCN is also \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 96  working to “mainstream” drug control into the activities of the entire government.  Enlisting the support of other ministries to counter illicit drugs requires top-level Afghan government support, which has been historically lacking.   To combat drug trafficking, the Afghan government, with assistance from the United States and other donors, operates the Criminal Justice Task Force (CJTF), a self-contained judicial unit established under the 2010 Counter Narcotics Law and housed at the Counternarcotics Justice Center (CNJC).  CNJC also houses the Counter Narcotics Tribunal and a detention center.  It serves as the central facility for the investigation, prosecution, and trial of major drug and drug-related corruption cases.  From December 22, 2017, through September 22, 2018 (the first nine months of 2018 according to the solar calendar), the CNJC processed 269 cases, involving 322 suspects.  From these cases, the government confiscated approximately 1.69 metric tons (MT) of heroin, along with 19.4 MT of raw opium, 3.87 MT of morphine, and 31.09 MT of hashish.  The United States and Afghanistan have neither a bilateral extradition treaty nor a mutual legal assistance treaty in force, but they do cooperate on investigations on a case-by-case basis.  Afghanistan’s new penal code authorizes confiscating assets (including land, structures, and vehicles) used in, or earned through, narcotics production and trafficking.  However, the government did not have procedures in place to distribute the proceeds of seized assets to support law enforcement.   2.  Supply Reduction  According to the 2018 Afghanistan Opium Survey – jointly produced by UNODC and MCN – growers cultivated 262,673 ha of opium poppy in 2018, a 20 percent decrease from 2017.  MCN analysis suggests the decrease is due to both lowered crop yield resulting from drought conditions and a low market price following 2017’s record crop.  The 2018 poppy cultivation figure for Helmand province was 136,798 ha, which was the highest of any province and 48 percent of the 2018 country total.  U.S. government estimates for 2018 Afghanistan opium production were not available at the time of this report.  Aside from opium, Afghanistan cultivates cannabis and produces significant amounts of hashish.  The latest available cannabis survey (2012) estimates that 10,000 ha of commercial cannabis cultivation is sufficient to potentially produce approximately 1,400 MT of hashish.   Poppy eradication decreased in 2018, with officials destroying 327 ha of opium poppy fields, compared to 750 ha in 2017.  This is well short of eradication totals in 2015 (3,760), 2014 (2,692), and 2013 (7,348).  Only four provinces conducted eradication in 2018, and the majority of eradication took place in Nangarhar province (287 ha).  Deteriorating security conditions, changes in the way eradicated fields are verified, a lack of political will, Taliban control over many rural areas, and MCN’s ineffective management of the Afghan inter-ministerial process all contributed to anemic eradication efforts in 2018.  The United States supports the Afghan government-led eradication efforts through the Governor-Led Eradication (GLE) program that reimburses provincial governors at a rate of $250 per hectare for costs associated with verified poppy eradication.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 97  The Counter Narcotics Police of Afghanistan (CNPA) are increasingly able to plan and conduct effective counterdrug operations.  The United States supports specialized units within the CNPA, including the Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) and the National Interdiction Unit (NIU).  These units are mentored by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and U.S. Special Operations Forces, a relationship that has increased access to key military enablers and has led to record seizures.  During the first nine months of 2018, the NIU and the SIU conducted 85 joint operations and reported the seizure of drugs and chemicals worth more than $109 million, including nine MT of opium, 1.3 MT of heroin, and 15.7 MT of morphine base, according to figures provided to DEA by the Afghan specialized units.  Additionally, the NIU and SIU arrested 175 individuals during this period, including 29 leaders identified by DEA as “Major Targets.”     Primary trafficking routes into and out of Afghanistan are through the Balkan route (Iran to Turkey to Eastern and Western Europe); the southern route (Pakistan and Iran to Africa, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Canada); and the northern route (Central Asia to the Russian Federation).  Clandestine drug laboratories within Afghanistan and in neighboring countries process a large portion of the country's opium into heroin and morphine, illicitly importing large quantities of precursor chemicals to facilitate production.  NIU operations targeting these laboratories and chemicals resulted in the destruction of over 100 laboratories and the reported seizure of nearly 93,800 liters and 16.3 MT of precursor chemicals during the first nine months of 2018.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  The Afghan government acknowledges that Afghanistan has one of the highest substance abuse rates in the world.  The 2015 Afghanistan National Drug Use Survey identified that rural drug use is far higher than urban use, and more than 38 percent of rural Afghan households included at least one member who tested positive for some form of illicit drug.  To stem the effects of this public health crisis, the United States funded a rural treatment pilot project to expand substance abuse treatment to the hardest hit local communities, in addition to continuing to support 86 drug treatment centers across the country in conjunction with the Ministry of Public Health.  The demand for treatment and prevention services far exceeds the capacity of the centers, most of which have extensive waiting lists for new patients.  The United States also supports UNODC’s global children’s addiction program to develop protocols for treating children, training treatment staff, and delivering services through non-governmental organizations.   The United States engages in robust public information programming and funds communication and outreach programs aimed at discouraging poppy cultivation, preventing drug use, and encouraging licit crop cultivation.  The United States also supports an anti-drug curriculum in Afghan schools, which has trained more than 1,900 teachers and reached more than 600,000 students in 900 schools.      4.  Corruption  The Afghan Government as a whole does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering illicit proceeds.  Widespread and longstanding \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 98  credible allegations and media reporting suggest, however, that many individual government officials directly engage in, and benefit from, the drug trade.  Corrupt practices range from facilitating drug activities to benefiting from drug trade revenue streams, to thwarting arrests and prosecutions.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  In, 2015, President Ghani approved a four-year National Drug Action Plan (NDAP), establishing three interrelated goals:  1) decrease the cultivation of opium poppy; 2) decrease the production and trafficking of opiates; and 3) reduce the demand for illicit drugs while increasing the provision of treatment for users.  The NDAP targets all facets of the drug trade, from cultivation and production to trafficking and use, by employing incentives such as alternative development and deterrents such as eradication, interdiction, and prosecution.  The U.S. government’s drug control priorities for Afghanistan include disrupting the drug trade and targeting drug revenues that finance the insurgency; developing licit alternative livelihoods; strengthening law enforcement and eradication efforts; reducing the demand for drugs; and building the Afghan government’s drug control capacity.   More broadly, the United States seeks to restore Afghanistan’s agriculture economy, to strengthen its institutional capacity, and to disrupt the nexus of drugs, insurgents, and corruption.  Agriculture accounts for one quarter of Afghanistan’s gross domestic product and employs approximately 62 percent of its workforce; a key challenge to reducing drug production is developing economically viable alternatives to poppy and sustained workforce employment.  The United States, in coordination with Afghan and international partners, promotes licit crop production where poppy is cultivated and funds projects designed to support farmers and agri-businesses in targeted value chains, including wheat, livestock, and high-value horticulture.   The United States is currently implementing alternative development initiatives, within the framework of the Afghanistan Integrated Country Strategy, to reduce illicit drug production and promote sustainable agriculture-led economic growth.  The Boost Alternative Development Interventions through Licit Livelihoods (BADILL) project, implemented by UNODC, aims to strengthen and diversify licit livelihoods of small and marginal farmers through alternative development methods.  The project supports and strengthens selected value chains in production, processing, quality control, and market linkages across 13 target provinces.  The Community-Based Agriculture and Rural Development projects implemented by the UN Development Program (UNDP) work to improve household income while reducing dependency on illicit poppy cultivation for selected communities in 12 high-poppy cultivating districts in Badghis, Farah, and Nangarhar provinces.  The projects will also develop and strengthen community-based agri-business infrastructure, such as irrigation, transportation, and storage facilities.  D.  Conclusion  The illicit cultivation, production, trade, and use of illicit drugs undermine public health and good governance in Afghanistan, while fueling corruption, providing significant funding for insurgents, and eroding security.  Opium cultivation is most prevalent where physical and economic infrastructure is least developed, and where the Afghan government lacks control.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 99  Afghanistan will not succeed in combating the drug trade and drug use until Afghans view illicit drugs as a serious domestic problem.  That awareness is slowly building, but will remain incomplete until the Afghan government demonstrates the political will to challenge vested political and economic interests more robustly.   Most importantly, security will need to be established in areas controlled or contested by the Taliban before meaningful progress can be expected.  Afghanistan cannot interdict or eradicate itself out of this problem.  Alternative development, demand reduction, and public information, are important elements of a comprehensive poppy reduction strategy.  Increased efforts to enforce Afghan laws against illicit poppy cultivation and to arrest traffickers are necessary for success.  In addition to mainstreaming drug control efforts into other existing national strategies and programs, Afghanistan must actively combat corruption at all levels of government to regain public trust in its counterdrug campaigns, and ensure that provincial governors and other sub-national officials genuinely cooperate on national drug control plans and policies.  None of these achievements would be sufficient by itself, and each faces significant challenges in the coming years.  Success in countering Afghanistan’s place in the global drug trade will not come quickly or easily.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 100  Albania  Albania is both a source country of cannabis and, increasingly, a transit country for cocaine and heroin commanded largely by organized crime elements moving illicit drugs from source countries into European markets.  The volume of drug seizures and number of drug-related arrests in 2018 was significant, driven largely by Albanian law enforcement cooperation with international partners, increased international pressure, and Albania’s efforts to accede to the European Union.    Albania’s role as source or market for illicit drugs beyond cannabis is minor, but there has been an increase in seizures of cocaine transiting Albania to Europe, in addition to discoveries of heroin and cocaine processing labs in northern and central Albania.  Albanian crime groups traffic cocaine and heroin to European markets from source countries in South America and Asia.  Albania’s institutions are moderately equipped to fight drug crimes, but corruption at every level of government limits their overall effectiveness.  Official corruption is pervasive and fosters an environment in which drug traffickers are largely able to operate with impunity.    Efforts to eradicate and prosecute cannabis growers have been extensive but uneven, and disrupting the drug trafficking infrastructure that has developed over two decades is a challenge.  A high rate of unemployment and weak rule of law have created an ideal environment for the organized crime groups driving Albania’s drug control problem.  Albania’s exportation of cannabis and movement of illicit drugs to European markets is a highly lucrative enterprise for drug traffickers.  The status quo, which infrequently leads to convictions or imprisonment, is no deterrent for criminals.  Albania is, however, moving towards justice reform to prosecute and convict criminals of trafficking drugs by leveraging organized crime affiliation.  Prosecutors now combine drug-related charges with organized crime charges.    U.S. assistance supports Albania’s integrated border-management risk analysis to identify potential drug traffickers; law enforcement training on investigative techniques; provision of equipment to enhance drug search capabilities; and implementation of justice reforms that are impacting the legal landscape of drug trafficking.  Sustained U.S. engagement has increased Albania’s ability to detect drug smuggling at borders and set up a framework for Albania to target organized crime rings moving illicit drugs across the globe.  It is vital that the Albanian government continues implementation of justice reform and works to erode the influence of organized crime.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 101  Algeria  Algeria is principally a transit country for illicit drugs rather than a center of production or consumption.  The Government of Algeria is actively working to address the problem through increased enforcement and treatment efforts.  Although the Algerian government’s security forces focus primarily on counter-terrorism efforts and border security, officials have become increasingly concerned about possible links between al-Qa’ida in the Islamic Maghreb and drug trafficking.  Algerian authorities report the bulk of drugs transiting Algeria consisted of cannabis originating from Morocco.  Traffickers also smuggle smaller quantities of cocaine, heroin, and psychotropic drugs into and through Algeria.  Most of these drugs travel by sea to Europe, while some are smuggled overland to Middle Eastern destinations.  Algeria‘s borders stretch over 4,000 miles and are sparsely populated and difficult to monitor.  Cannabis resin remains the most widely consumed and transited drug, though cocaine, heroin, and psychotropic substances are also used and trafficked through the country.   The government is combatting domestic consumption of illicit drugs through expanding facilities for treating drug addiction.  Currently, there are 42 Intermediate Addiction Treatment Centers (CISAS) operating in Algeria.  Patients received at these centers rose from 9,897 in 2007 to 22,444 in 2017.  Voluntary hospitalization, therapeutic interventions, and outpatient consultations form the basis of CISAS treatment.  Algerian law provides for jail time of up to two years for use and between 10-20 years for drug trafficking and distribution.  For consumption cases, the law gives preference to treatment over penal judgments.  Algeria has updated its drug control regulations to conform to international agreements, including relevant UN treaties.  Algeria works within the Euro-Mediterranean cooperation network MedNET, created in 2006 to advance regional cooperation in the fight against drugs.  The National Office for the Fight Against Drugs and Addiction coordinates the Government of Algeria’s drug policies and produces official reports on the country’s drug problem.  The National Police, Customs, and National Gendarmerie are responsible for day-to-day enforcement.  During the first eight months of 2018, authorities seized 27.7 metric tons of cannabis and 958,476 doses of psychotropic substances, and arrested 33,595 individuals on drug-related charges.  In May 2018, authorities seized a shipment of 701 kilograms of cocaine in the port of Oran.  Algeria would benefit from further training to boost counterdrug capabilities of its security forces.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 102  Argentina  Transnational criminal organizations utilize Argentina as a transshipment point for Andean cocaine destined to European and other international markets.  Domestic cocaine processing and consumption are growing concerns, and the consumption of domestically processed cocaine base is prevalent in poorer neighborhoods.  U.S.-Argentine security cooperation has strengthened under President Mauricio Macri’s administration.  The Security Ministry has adopted best practices from U.S. law enforcement, strengthening collaborative criminal intelligence efforts between federal and provincial forces through interagency task forces.  An interagency task force launched in 2018 in Salta province focuses on a key entry point for Andean cocaine.    The government unveiled a national program to combat drug trafficking in 2016 that proposed increased targeting of drug trafficking organizations and efforts to reduce cocaine base consumption.  A presidential decree in 2016 declared a state of national emergency that resulted in the federal Drug Demand Reduction Agency implementing demand reduction policies throughout the country.  The government continues to deploy federal forces into major urban centers in response to public safety concerns.  These efforts reduce resources available for combating smuggling at the border and along key corridors.  In July 2018, President Macri issued executive decree 683 authorizing the military to support domestic civilian security efforts against non-state actors, including transnational drug traffickers.     Seizures of cocaine conversion laboratories and the availability of cocaine base suggested increased domestic processing.  Official statistics show seizures of cocaine, marijuana, and synthetic drugs all increased from 2015 to 2017.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Argentine authorities reported seizing approximately 137.8 metric tons (MT) of marijuana and 5.56 MT of cocaine, a 66 percent increase and a 35 percent drop, respectively.  Most cocaine seizures were in the Salta and Jujuy provinces bordering Bolivia and Paraguay.  Marijuana seizures primarily were in the Misiones and Corrientes provinces, bordering Brazil and Paraguay.  Argentina is a regular participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring together maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international organizations spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  Argentina adopted legal and procedural reforms to improve investigations and prosecutions of drug trafficking and other criminal enterprises.  These reforms allow for greater use of certain special investigative measures, including informants and undercover officers in investigations.  New legislation enabling cooperating witnesses helped advance corruption cases.  Constructive measures Argentina could undertake include focusing interdiction efforts on targeted regions and transportation sectors; allowing defendant cooperation for sentence reductions and controlled deliveries to further investigations; further enhancing federal and provincial coordination; boosting judicial efficiency in case management, investigations, and prosecutions; increasing border security resources; and coordinating drug supply and demand reduction strategies.  Argentina’s extradition, customs, and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States are utilized to the benefit of both countries.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 103  Armenia  Armenia is primarily a transit country for illicit drugs originating in Southwest Asia and destined for markets in Europe and Russia.  Most drug supplies transiting Armenia originate in Afghanistan and transit Iran before entering Armenia over land borders or by aerial transshipment.  The Armenian Government maintains directive control over law enforcement, border enforcement, prosecutorial, and judicial functions.  Russian border guards manage Armenia’s borders with Turkey and Iran and compose part of the immigration staff at the Yerevan and Gyumri international airports.  Armenian law enforcement agencies typically do not cooperate with the Armenian customs service on international investigations.  A popular revolution in April-May 2018 resulted in a new government that promised to fight corruption, but said little about illicit drugs until October 2018, when the acting prime minister pledged to eliminate drug trafficking through Armenia’s Syunik province.  Despite an increase in the volume of drugs seized over the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017 that included some highly publicized seizures, there have been no arrests of high-level criminal figures related to drug trafficking.  Interceptions of large shipments remain rare.     Between January and June 2018, Armenian law enforcement registered 512 criminal cases involving illegal distribution of illicit drugs, including 45 cases of drug smuggling.  Authorities seized 32.2 kilograms (kg) of illicit drugs, 25.5 grams of psychotropic substances, and three grams of precursor chemicals.  Heroin seizures increased by over 300 percent in the first six months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017, which could be due to better screening practices at borders and checkpoints and/or a more robust focus on anti-drug policing.  Multi-ton quantities of heroin, nevertheless, likely continue to pass through Armenian borders.     On May 1, two Iranian nationals flying to Armenia were detained carrying “large quantities” of opium, methamphetamine, and heroin.  In June, Armenia announced the investigation of a transnational criminal group that attempted to smuggle opium, heroin, and marijuana from Iran through Armenia to Georgia.  On September 30, a Guatemalan citizen was detained at Yerevan’s international airport for smuggling 3.5 kg of cocaine.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 104  The Bahamas  A.  Introduction  The Bahamas is not a significant drug producing country, but remains a significant transshipment point for illicit drugs bound for the United States and other international markets.  The Bahamas’ location, less than 50 miles off the coast of Florida at its closest point, makes it a natural conduit for drug trafficking.  The Bahamian archipelago stretches over a nautical area the size of Florida with over 700 islands and 2,000 cays, the vast majority of which are uninhabited.  The Bahamas boasts 10 international airports, 56 airstrips, and more than 80 marinas.  Traffickers blend in among numerous pleasure craft moving between Florida and The Bahamas.  Trafficking also occurs through commercial freighters and commercial and private planes.  Trafficking enables and strengthens transnational criminal organizations and gang activity.   The United States and The Bahamas enjoy a long-standing history of law enforcement cooperation.  There is strong political will within the Bahamian government to tackle drug trafficking and organized crime.  Operation Bahamas, Turks and Caicos (OPBAT), a tripartite agreement dating back to the 1980s, spells out the obligations of The Bahamas, Turks and Caicos Islands, and the United States to improve their effectiveness in the fight against drug trafficking.  Bolstered by this agreement, Bahamian and U.S. law enforcement agencies have partnered in several major law enforcement operations targeting trafficking organizations.  In 2018, these operations resulted in numerous arrests and the seizure of cocaine and marijuana.   Demand for cocaine within the country remains low, though a small domestic market does exist.  Use of marijuana, including among adolescents, remains a concern.  The government is reviewing a 2018 CARICOM Regional Commission on Marijuana report that recommended the declassification of marijuana as a dangerous drug and its reclassification as a controlled substance; however, the government has not proposed any associated policy changes.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  During 2018, there was a notable increase in communication, effectiveness, and cooperation between Bahamian law enforcement agencies and the United States.  New leadership in the Royal Bahamas Police Force (RBPF) and Ministry of National Security, as well as the leadership within the Royal Bahamas Defense Force (RBDF), were integral to many of these improvements.  The Bahamas passed a new Proceeds of Crime Bill in March 2018, which strengthened the measures to recover any income or assets received from criminal activity and created a new category for unexplained wealth.  The Bahamas also updated The Financial Transactions Reporting Act in 2018, which increased reporting requirements, as well as abilities for investigation into financial matters by relevant bodies.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 105  The greatest challenge to the host government in tackling the trafficking issue remains the weakness of the Bahamian criminal justice sector.  While the average time between initial arraignment and trial in 2017 was within 90 days for minor offenses, for more serious matters, such as those involving trafficking, smuggling, firearms, or gang violence, regular adjournments prolonged cases, in some instances for several years.  Many accused choose to go to trial, confident the courts will take years to move their case through the system and the government will eventually drop the charges.  Despite these challenges, the Judiciary has begun making important improvements.  In 2018, the Magistrate Courts, Supreme Court, and Court of Appeals courts introduced U.S.-provided digital audio recording equipment in the courtroom to record procedures and serve as the official record in the Magistrate’s courts.  The Judiciary expects this improvement to increase both the transparency and efficiency of the justice sector.  The Bahamas signed a comprehensive maritime agreement with the United States in 2004, which continues to enable cooperation in counterdrug and migrant interdiction operations in and around Bahamian territorial waters.  The Bahamas has an extradition and mutual legal assistance treaty (MLAT) in place with the United States.     2.  Supply Reduction  U.S. law enforcement agencies integrate with the RBPF and RBDF to gather law enforcement intelligence, conduct investigations, and execute interdictions.  These operations are supported by marine, technical, and training resources provided through U.S. assistance programs.  With a small population base (353,000 according to the 2010 Census) and significant territory to cover, pooling U.S. and local resources and knowledge are essential to efficient deterrence and interdiction.  Beginning in January, four major law enforcement operations targeting trafficking networks were executed within The Bahamas in 2018.  All four operations resulted in multiple arrests, as well as weapons and drug interdictions.  For three of the four operations, the RBPF and RBDF worked in partnership - a first in many years and a sign of increasing cooperation between the two agencies.  Additionally, the RBPF and RBDF prioritized the forward deployment of their marine assets throughout the archipelago, improving interdictions further afield, including numerous interdictions from the windward pass and throughout the southern Bahamian islands.    On March 20, Bahamian security forces successfully executed Operation Northern Strike, one of the most significant Bahamian-planned, executed, and led operations in recent history.  With technical assistance and planning support from U.S. law enforcement, Bahamian law enforcement accomplished their mission of targeting transnational criminal organizations responsible for trafficking drugs, people, and weapons, arresting 51 individuals and confiscating narcotics, weapons, and currency.  On September 24, RBPF and RBDF forces successfully executed Operation Tidal Surge in the Abaco Islands, targeting another smuggling network.  This operation resulted in 26 arrests and the seizure of cocaine, marijuana, and weapons.  This operation demonstrated the ability of these Bahamian forces and U.S. law enforcement to work together and across a distance in the archipelago.  On November 5, RBPF forces intercepted two high-speed vessels travelling from Andros Island to Nassau resulting in the seizure of nearly 900 kilograms (kg) of marijuana.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 106   During the first 10 months of 2018, coordinated U.S.-Bahamian operations in The Bahamas led to 203 arrests and the seizure of approximately 176 kg of cocaine, 5.66 metric tons of marijuana, and $1,693,809 in currency and $43,400 in assets.  Joint operations also eradicated 2,520 cannabis plants – an amount similar to 2017 and an indication that cannabis cultivation remains steady.  U.S. and local law enforcement investigations indicate that illicit trafficking through The Bahamas remains high.  The total number of major operations increased significantly from the previous year due to increased levels of cooperation.  Throughout 2018, traffickers continued to split up larger loads into smaller loads before entering the southern Bahamas.  Traffickers move cocaine through The Bahamas via “go-fast” boats, small commercial freighters, maritime shipping containers, and small aircraft.  Traffickers move cocaine from The Bahamas to Florida by blending in with legitimate traffic that transits these areas.  Larger go-fast and sport fishing vessels transport marijuana from Jamaica both to The Bahamas and through The Bahamas into Florida.  Haitian and Haitian-Bahamian drug trafficking organizations, networked between Haiti and the significant Haitian diaspora in The Bahamas, continue to play a role in the movement of cocaine.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  With U.S. support, the Bahamian government partnered with the Organization of American States to conduct a comprehensive drug use survey in 2018.  According to the survey respondents, 20 percent of male respondents admitted to smoking marijuana, while the same was true for 7 percent of females.  Of the respondents who admitted to smoking, 40 percent admitted to smoking on a daily basis.  Only 1 percent of respondents admitted to cocaine usage.  Over 40 percent claimed to know a friend or family member who takes illegal drugs, with most reporting knowing two or more people.    The Public Hospitals Authority offers residential substance abuse treatment programs, drop-in treatment programs, substance abuse prevention programs, and relapse prevention programs.  The United States partnered with the Public Hospitals Authority to train, mentor, and certify drug treatment professionals both from within and outside government.  Following the certification of its professionals, the Public Hospitals Authority and other partners developed a training program for other substance use treatment staff in the country to learn about substance use issues.  From the completion of the certification program in 2016, the Public Hospitals Authority has trained over 150 staff from local hospitals, the prison, the school for boys and girls, and local emergency rooms on New Providence Island and Grand Bahama Island.   The Bahamas Department of Correctional Services has a small residential drug treatment program, which can accommodate up to 21 inmates at a time.  The United States has provided training for the corrections officers that provide drug treatment programs at the facility; several prison guards have also received additional training from the Public Hospitals Authority.     4.  Corruption  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 107  The Government of the Commonwealth of The Bahamas does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  Further, Free National Movement government has prioritized addressing public corruption as part of its national agenda.  During calendar year 2018, at least four government employees were arrested and charged with drug-related offenses.  These officials were investigated by the RBPF.     C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  In 2018, a CBSI-funded maritime surveillance system radar was installed in the southern-most island of Great Inagua to provide greater visibility of maritime and air traffic through the windward pass.  CBSI funds have also been used over the past two years to provide maintenance and logistic support for the RBDF maritime interceptor vessels.  In addition, security cooperation activities with the RBDF enhance capabilities in maritime law enforcement, intelligence, small boat operations, port security, engineering, disaster relief, and maintenance.    The United States and The Bahamas maintain close maritime law enforcement cooperation and coordination under a comprehensive maritime agreement to combat illicit trafficking of illicit drugs by sea and air.  The Bahamas is a regular participant in the annual Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summit and hosted the sixth iteration of the summit in Nassau on August 7-8, 2018, bringing together over 100 maritime counterdrug professionals from over 15 countries from across the Caribbean and Europe.  The United States has delivered training, technical assistance, and equipment needed by Bahamian government counterparts to combat transnational organized criminal networks and improve citizen security in The Bahamas.  In October 2018, the United States completed the installation of digital recording equipment in the Magistrates and Supreme Court courtrooms in New Providence, Grand Bahama, and Abaco Islands.  The courts use this equipment to record court proceedings in support of Bahamian plans to increase justice sector efficiency.  Additionally, the Embassy donated ballistics vests and protective gear, a new Leica macroscope, and updated licenses and training on IBM computer programs to the RBPF.  Finally, the Embassy provided training for the Internal Affairs Division within the Bahamas Department of Corrections.   The United States sent officials from the police and justice sector to external training focused on organized crime, investigating gangs, and trafficking in persons.  The United States organized a training for magistrates and registrars to prepare them for the administrational changes involved with the new digital audio recording equipment.  Additionally, the United States provided a senior justice advisor to meet with key staff in the Ministries of National Security, Legal Affairs, and Finance to provide technical assistance as these ministries establish practices to address issues with corruption.  The advisor provided guidance on draft legislation, as well as established a program for increasing contact between these ministries and several U.S. counterparts.  The United States supported Bahamian participation in the International Drug Enforcement Conference (organized by DEA) and other regional counterdrug training opportunities. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 108   U.S. assistance for demand reduction supports the Ministry of National Security, the Public Hospitals Authority, and nongovernmental organizations.  Additionally, the United States supported training focused on drug demand reduction and improved corrections policies addressing drug use and demand within prisons.   D.  Conclusion  The United States and The Bahamas enjoy a long-standing cooperative relationship against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime.  Drug trafficking and related smuggling will remain a primary concern for the United States in The Bahamas.  The United States will continue to assist Bahamian efforts to counter these networks and increase efficiencies in the administration of justice through a range of assistance, and OPBAT and the CBSI framework will continue to bolster Bahamian drug-control institutions and enhance U.S. and Bahamian law enforcement relationships.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 109  Belgium  Belgium is a primary entry point for cocaine smuggled into Europe.  South America-based drug trafficking organizations transport cocaine through the Port of Antwerp to reach the lucrative European drug market and beyond.  Highly profitable cocaine sales in Europe strengthen the various drug trafficking organizations, allowing them to expand their reach to other points around the world, including the United States.   The Port of Antwerp has experienced record-breaking cocaine seizures over the past several years from within containerized cargo arriving at the port.  This is the result of increased coca production in Colombia, the port’s relative exposure as an area difficult to fully police, and successful law enforcement at other European ports.  Belgian authorities seized approximately 30 metric tons (MT) of cocaine in 2016, approximately 41 MT of cocaine in 2017, and approximately 36 MT of cocaine during the first 10 months of 2018 at the Port of Antwerp.  In addition, South American authorities seized approximately 28 MT of cocaine destined for Antwerp during the same period in 2018.   The seized cocaine in 2017 alone would have generated more than $1.2 billion in drug proceeds, and consequently, significant drug money laundering.  Criminal networks increasingly use virtual currencies to facilitate illicit drug trafficking in Belgium.  The online sale of synthetic drugs, including via non-searchable web sites (“Dark Web”), has increased significantly, resulting in more cyber currency investigations by Belgian police authorities.  Belgium and U.S. law enforcement agencies maintain close operational cooperation, focusing on cocaine trafficking and drug money laundering.  The United States and Belgium fully utilize extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements.  Despite strong international information sharing and cooperation, local capacity issues have prevented police from fully carrying out many large-scale drug investigations.  Drug trafficking organizations appear to operate with little fear of legal reprisal, in part due to the relative lack of applicable criminal sanctions.  Belgium has not historically been a source of precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs, despite a robust chemical industry.  Belgium has, however, served as transit point for precursor chemicals sourced out of China and India and destined for clandestine synthetic drug laboratories in the Netherlands, Mexico, and elsewhere.       \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 110  Belize  A.  Introduction   Belize is a major transit country for illegal drugs that originate from countries in South America.  Due to Belize’s location and sparse population, transnational criminal organizations exploit both clandestine and legal airstrips to refuel or offload drugs, primarily cocaine, for further transshipment by land through Guatemala or Mexico and ultimately to the United States.  Traffickers also exploit Belize’s offshore barrier islands and porous coastline to move drug shipments by “go-fast” boats.  Authorities in 2018 successfully seized 996.2 kilograms (kg) of cocaine from aircraft carrying illicit drugs, the first major interdictions in eight years.  Better-resourced drug interdiction efforts in neighboring Guatemala and nearby Honduras will increase the likelihood that traffickers will expand their efforts to exploit Belize’s permissive environment and limited law enforcement capacity.    The Belizean police, military, and Coast Guard share responsibility for drug interception, but none is adequately resourced.  Belize has no air defense systems, no radar systems capable of monitoring night flights, and no maritime radar.  It has significant equipment and equipment maintenance needs, limited law enforcement response capability, and systemic investigative and prosecutorial limitations.  These resource constraints directly inhibit Belize’s ability to interdict shipments and prosecute traffickers.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishment, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development   The Government of Belize is cognizant of the dangers posed by its status as a transit point.  It is particularly concerned that growing violence in Belize is, and will increasingly be, tied to the drug trade.  However, Belize’s domestic criminal concerns are focused on extremely high levels of local gang-related violence, which is not yet clearly tied to transnational organized crime.  Members of transnational criminal gangs, such as MS-13, have been arrested in Belize, but such regional groups do not appear to be organized in the country.  Given Belize’s resource constraints, most of its law enforcement and legislative initiatives are necessarily tied to domestic gang activity.  U.S.-funded programs focus on improving specialized units, police and criminal justice procedures, border security, technology, information sharing (internally and regionally), forensic improvements, and police professionalism.    Belize assists in the capture and repatriation of U.S. citizen fugitives through provisions of the Belize Immigration Act.  Extraditions from Belize have been less successful.  A bilateral extradition treaty between the United States and Belize has been in force since 2001, and a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between the United States and Belize has been in force since 2003.  Belize also has an extradition treaty with Mexico.   Belize also has a shiprider agreement with the United States (1992, amended in 2000).  Belize’s other shiprider agreements are the Agreement Concerning Co-operation in Suppressing Illicit Maritime and Air Trafficking in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances in the Caribbean \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 111  Area and the Proliferation Security Initiative Agreement.  Regionally, Belize is a party to the Inter American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance and the Caribbean Community (CARICOM) Mutual Legal Assistance Treaty.  Belize also has a Mutual Legal Assistance Act, which provides a basis for considering request for legal assistance with countries with which it does not have a legal assistance treaty.  Belize is giving consideration to adhering to the CARICOM Arrest Warrant Treaty.  A Pharmaceutical Ad Hoc Committee, established in 2014 to assess the trends relating to the movement of pharmaceutical drugs in Belize, dissolved from inactivity.  In late 2018, the Ministry of National Security instructed the National Security Council to establish a task force to begin collecting precursor chemical data.  2.  Supply Reduction  Belize operates a multi-agency approach to drug interdiction.  The Belize Police Department is the primary agency responsible for drug law enforcement.  It has two U.S.-supported specialized units – the Anti-Narcotics Unit comprised of 15 police officers and Mobile Interdiction Team comprised of 38 members.  The Belize Coast Guard is responsible for the protection of Belize’s territorial waters and interdiction of illicit activities in the maritime environment.  The Belize Defense Force (army) is often used as a supplemental force.  Interdiction activities are coordinated through the Joint Intelligence Operations Center.    Since November 2017, eight aircraft became stranded in Belize, mainly due to suspected damage from rough landings at illicit strips.  Authorities seized 556.2 kg of cocaine from one of the planes.  An additional seizure of 440 kg of cocaine was made after a ninth illicit aircraft landing.  Based on the size of the aircraft that are known to have landed, the smallest being a Cessna and the largest a Hawker jet, the potential quantity of narcotics transported ranges from 300 to 3,000 kg per aircraft.  It is unknown how many total aircraft landed and successfully departed undetected.    The Belize Defense Force, Coast Guard, Anti-Narcotics Unit, and other police forces conducted multiple cannabis eradication operations in the first nine months of 2018.  The Anti-Narcotics Unit seized 44.32 kg of cannabis and arrested six persons between those seizures and the aircraft interdiction; the Mobile Interdiction Team seized approximately 31 kg of cannabis and arrested six persons at highway checkpoints in the same timeframe.  If other seizures are made by the police, the numbers are not disseminated.  3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Belize’s domestic drug use is difficult to quantify, and no data is collected by the government.  Historically, marijuana is the primary illicit drug used in the country.  In November 2017, Belize decriminalized the possession of up to 10 grams of marijuana for both recreational and medicinal purposes.  There are some indications that there is increasing public use of cocaine and crack cocaine.  However, Belize does not have the capacity to locally test for cocaine, other narcotics, or synthetics by its forensic services.  The public health sector is able to test for marijuana and cocaine. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 112   Belize’s National Drug Abuse Control Council (within the Ministry of Health) is the lead agency in the prevention and control of drug abuse.  The Council provides drug education prevention programs to schools and communities.  Its objective is to reduce the demand and supply of drugs and alleviate the associated consequences.  From 2015-2017, the Council provided drug prevention education programs to 48,138 students.  Its outreach services for persons living with drug addiction grew from 256 clients in 2015 to 373 clients in 2017 (the most recent available data).  Its other efforts include attending regional fora and organizing community health and education fairs, workshops on drugs and the workplace, and prevention training for school counselors.    Belize’s central prison, co-managed by the government and a church-affiliated non-governmental organization The Kolbe Foundation, launched the Ashcroft Rehabilitation Center in 2018.  The program features a group-based approach to address personality disorders, substance abuse, and habitual addiction, all aimed at inmate reform reducing recidivism rates, including drug-related crimes.   4.  Corruption   The Government of Belize does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution.  However, insufficient resources, weak law enforcement institutions, an ineffective judicial system, and inadequate compensation for civil service employees and public safety officials facilitate corruption.    Belize lacks laws specifically addressing drug-related corruption.  The Prevention of Corruption Act, passed in 2000, includes measures to combat corruption related to illicit monetary gains and the misuse of public funds while holding public office.  It also provides a code of conduct for civil servants.  Belize did not charge anyone under this act in 2017 or 2018.  A Special Audit of the Immigration and Nationality Department found multiple cases of fraud and corruption within the department.  After this revelation and other reports of corruption among senior government officials (not related to illicit drugs) and significant public pressure, Belize signed and ratified the United Nations Convention against Corruption (UNCAC) in 2016.  In the course of implementing UNCAC, the government completed a self-assessment checklist; participated in a technical exchange visit in Jamaica; and initiated an impact of corruption assessment.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   U.S.-funded programs support citizen security, border security, and rule of law programs aimed to improve Belize’s security structures.  U.S. assistance, consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Central America, through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), focuses on building transparency and accountability, capacity building, and other institutional-level improvements.    Belize is a participating member of the CARICOM Implementation Agency for Crime and Security (IMPACS), which provides research and passenger data support through the Joint Regional Communications Center based in Barbados.  IMPACS is assisting Belize in \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 113  implementing the Advance Passenger Information System (APIS), a widely-used data interchange system that allows air and sea carriers to streamline and transmit traveler data.  APIS is recognized by commercial carriers and the international community as the standard for passenger processing and enhanced security in the commercial air and vessel environment.  Once implemented, commercial carriers will be able to share information with Belizean officials on individuals and cargo flagged by international law enforcement authorities for suspicious behavior or outstanding warrants, including related to drug crimes.  Belize is also focused on improving its information and data sharing processes and is working with the United States and international partners.  The Joint Information Operations Center was designed to be the hub for collating and sharing information within Belize and with international partners.  Through the information sharing process, its goal is to combat transnational criminal threats and transnational criminal networking by addressing the reduction of violent crime, border crossings, weapon smuggling, human and drug trafficking, and dismantling of local criminal networks.  U.S. advisors are working with the Government of Belize to improve the policies and procedures that will provide a better process for responses to transnational threats and drug crimes.  The United States and Belize have signed Letters of Agreement (LOAs) concerning both drug control and maritime security.  The LOAs, dated August 2010, include elements of establishing the police vetted unit and its area of responsibility, security sector reform, drug control, transnational crime, demand reduction, and community policing.    The United States also maintains a bilateral agreement with Belize to suppress illicit traffic by sea and air, which includes provisions for ship boarding, ship riders, pursuit, entry to investigate, over flight of territorial seas, order to land, and for the use of third-party platforms.  Belize is a regular participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring together maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international organizations spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  D.  Conclusion    Belize faces a challenging drug control environment and strong leadership is necessary to reduce the impact of drug trafficking and crime in the country.  The United States will continue to assist Belize’s law enforcement and justice sectors by providing training, advisory, and institutional support to combat drug trafficking.  The United States encourages Belize to strengthen its public security and law enforcement institutions through more effective anti-corruption legislation, modern drug control legislation, comprehensive background checks and vetting of new and existing personnel, enhanced training, and continuing education programs.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 114  Benin  Benin is a significant transshipment point for cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, and chemical precursors used to produce illicit drugs.  Nigerian drug syndicates partner with Beninese nationals based in Benin.  Cocaine from South America and heroin from Southwest Asia via East Africa transit Benin for major markets in Western Europe.  Methamphetamine produced in Nigeria transits Benin for markets in Europe, Southeast Asia, and South Africa.  There was also some evidence of illicit drug trafficking to the United States in 2018, according to U.S. law enforcement authorities.  Locally cultivated cannabis remains the most accessible illegal drug for consumption in Benin.  There is a small but growing domestic market in Benin for heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine.  Benin receives registered commercial freight shipments from India of the prescription opioid tramadol, destined for the Sahel, with high levels of local consumption and abuse.  Tramadol pills exceeding the usually prescribed dosage by tenfold (500 milligrams vs 50 milligrams) are commonly sold in Benin.   Benin introduced new measures in 2018 aimed at improving efficiency and performance in law enforcement and judicial operations.  In January, Benin merged its National Police and Gendarmerie to create a single law enforcement unit, the Republican Police.  The merger eliminated overlapping responsibilities in practice between units involved in drug control.  In September, a specialized criminal court with exclusive jurisdiction for drug-related crimes began hearing cases.  The ability of police and courts to insulate themselves from corruption and partiality remains a longstanding challenge in Benin and the region.  The Central Office for Repression of Illicit Trafficking of Drugs and Precursors (OCERTID) was created in 1999 under the national police to coordinate drug enforcement operations.  OCERTID reports monthly statistics on drug seizures; the national drug lab lacks equipment to test drugs or confirm purity.  Benin's Law on Control of Drugs and Precursors provides penalties of between one and 20 years in prison for trafficking drugs.  Individuals prosecuted for drug-related crimes in Benin are typically human couriers.  The Government of Benin must continue to make progress in improving coordination between its relevant agencies and build cooperation and trust with neighboring countries to successfully pursue complex case investigations.   Benin does not have a bilateral extradition treaty or a mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States, though it is party to multilateral conventions that enable cooperation.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 115  Bolivia  A.  Introduction  Although illicit drug consumption remains low in Bolivia, it remains the third largest source country of coca in the world, according to UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates, and is also a major transit zone for Peruvian cocaine.  In March 2017, President Evo Morales signed into law a bill increasing the licit area of coca production from 12,000 hectares (ha) to 22,000 ha.  However the United States government estimated 2017 cultivation amounts to be 31,000 ha (a modest decrease in coca cultivation from 2016 to 2017), and UNODC estimated Bolivia coca cultivation to be 24,500 ha (an increase of 1,400 ha from 2016 to 2017), both in excess of the limits established by the Government of Bolivia.  European Union (EU) studies reveal that domestic demand for the traditional, cultural, and religious use in Bolivia is less than 15,000 ha.    The Bolivian government has inadequate controls over its domestic coca cultivation, and UNODC calculated an estimated 35-48 percent of the coca that was cultivated in 2017 did not go to the two authorized coca markets for sale.  The United States government estimated cocaine production potential in Bolivia to be 249 metric tons (MT) in 2017.  Most Bolivian cocaine is exported to other Latin American countries, especially Brazil and Argentina, for domestic consumption, or for onward transit to West Africa and Europe, rather than to the United States.  In September 2018, the United States again determined that Bolivia “failed demonstrably” to adhere to its obligations under international drug control agreements and the U.S. Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, as amended.  This Presidential determination was based, in part, on insufficient justification for the increase in coca production authorized under Bolivian law.  According to the 2017 UNODC report, 91 percent of the coca grown in the Yungas region, approximately 20,822 MT, is sold in the legal market.  Conversely, nearly 91 percent of the coca grown in Cochabamba’s Chapare region, approximately 21,738 MT, is diverted away from the legal market.  Bolivian President Evo Morales is “president in perpetuity” of the coca growers’ federation in the Chapare region.    Peruvian officials estimate 41 percent of all Peruvian cocaine departs to or through Bolivia via ground or aerial transshipment, commonly known as the “air bridge.”  Bolivia reportedly confiscated seven aircraft involved in drug trafficking in 2018, down from 17 reportedly seized in 2017 by the Special Counter-Narcotics Police Force (FELCN).  In traditional (authorized) coca cultivation areas, Bolivia maintains a “social control” policy to curb illicit coca production.  Under this approach, the government usually negotiates with coca growers to obtain their consent for eradication.  In nontraditional (unauthorized) areas, including national parks, eradication is officially mandatory.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 116  In March 2017, President Morales promulgated two new laws to replace the Coca and Controlled Substances Law 1008 (1988).  In addition to increasing the licit area of coca production from 12,000 ha to 22,000 ha, the General Law on Coca (Law 906) provides a framework for the regulation of the production, circulation, transportation, marketing, consumption, research, industrialization, and promotion of coca in its natural state.  The new Controlled Substances Law (Law 913) includes three key enhancements:  a procedure for the payment of informants and plea-bargaining in drug-related cases; a procedure for asset forfeiture; and a framework for wiretapping in drug-related investigations.  It also provides a legal basis for two studies – one on coca yield per hectare and another to determine coca leaf-to-cocaine yield.  Both studies are under way by UNODC with European EU funding and their results are expected in the second half of 2019.  As of November 2018, the Controlled Substances Law’s implementing regulations were still pending approval from the Bolivian legislature and not in effect.  Bolivia has numerous entities with drug control mandates.  The National Drug Control Council (CONALTID), chaired by the Ministry of Government, is the central drug control policy-making body in Bolivia.  The Vice Ministry for Social Defense and Controlled Substances (VMSD) is mandated to combat drug trafficking, regulate coca production, advance coca eradication and drug prevention, and execute rehabilitation programs.  The General Law on Coca is enforced through a series of regulations that clarify responsibilities between governmental institutions and reinforce the role of the National Council for Revaluation, Production, Marketing, Research and Industrialization of Coca (CONCOCA) as the point for intergovernmental coordination.  Biometric registration of all coca producers and sellers is also mandatory by law, and regulations exist to monitor coca transportation routes, markets, and industrial research on coca.  FELCN reports to the VMSD and comprises approximately 1,700 personnel, and is the agency that focuses primarily on interdiction and money laundering cases.  The Joint Eradication Task Force (FTC) conducts manual coca eradication with approximately 2,300 personnel.  The Unit for the Execution of the Fight against Narcotics (UELICN) plans and funds drug enforcement operations.  In 2018, UELICN’s budget remained unchanged from 2017 at $48.3 million; however, a budget increase of about 25 percent is expected for 2019.  In 2018, Bolivia, with UNODC support, created the Regional Center for Counternarcotics Intelligence (CERIAN), a regional fusion center for intelligence analysis and information sharing based in Santa Cruz with the participation of Brazil, Argentina, and Paraguay.  Other border countries may join once a framework is finalized.  Bolivia’s 2016-2020 Strategy to Combat Drug Trafficking and Reduction of Excess Cultivation of Coca Leaf prioritizes actions against criminal organizations rather than what the Bolivian government considers legitimate farmers who cultivate coca for traditional uses.  The strategy includes four pillars:  reduction of supply; reduction of demand; control of the excess supply of coca; and shared international responsibilities.  Current Bolivian coca cultivation far exceeds the country’s demand for coca for traditional purposes.  The Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission of the Organization of American States continues to recommend that Bolivia implement a system to monitor narcotics and psychotropic drugs used in healthcare settings to ensure the medicines are not diverted for illegitimate uses.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 117  Bolivia receives most of its foreign counternarcotic financial support from the EU.  The EU is currently implementing a $50 million three-year (2016-2018) assistance program, and provides an additional $10 million to support UNODC drug control programs and technical assistance.  The Bolivian government denies that foreign drug cartels operate within its borders, but acknowledges the presence of cartel emissaries.  The United States and Bolivia are parties to a 1995 extradition treaty that permits the extradition of nationals for the most serious offenses, including drug trafficking.  Bolivia and the United States do not have a mutual legal assistance treaty, but both countries can request assistance through various multilateral conventions to which both are signatories.   2.  Supply Reduction   FELCN reported destroying 93 cocaine hydrochloride processing labs and 1,004 rustic cocaine labs during 2018, a 62 percent increase and 62 percent decrease, respectively, from 2017.  According to the Bolivian government, FELCN seized 10.48 MT of cocaine base and 7.59 MT of cocaine hydrochloride in 2018 – a 7.4 percent decrease and 153 percent increase, respectively, from what was seized during the first 10 months of 2017.  FELCN arrested 3,986 individuals on drug-related offenses in 2018.  Corruption, interference by other branches of government, and insufficient judicial resources undermine due process and create delays in the administration of justice.  The United States government estimated that coca cultivation was 31,000 ha in 2017, a 17 percent decrease from 2016, and that the production potential of cocaine decreased 9 percent from last year to 249 MT.  The modest reduction in the U.S. cultivation estimate is attributable to better survey data and analysis.  UNODC estimated that 24,500 ha of coca were cultivated within Bolivia in 2017, a 6 percent increase from 2016.  UNODC officials have noted that 91 percent of the Chapare region’s coca cultivation is destined for illicit cocaine production and not traditional consumption.  According to UNODC’s 2017 report published in August, there were 8,400 ha of coca cultivated in the Chapare region, an increase of 17 percent over the previous year.  According to the most recently available information from the Bolivian government, Bolivian authorities eradicated 8,600 ha of coca as of October, compared to 7,237 ha during all of 2017.  The Bolivian government estimates it needs to eradicate 11,000 ha of coca yearly to see a net reduction in coca cultivation.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Illicit drug consumption remains low in Bolivia, according to UNODC and the 2016 World Drug Report.  According to a joint 2016 CONALTID/UNODC study funded by the European Union on drug use in the university student population, 6.1 percent of Bolivian university students had used illicit drugs in the previous year.  Broken down by category, 5 percent of surveyed students had used marijuana; 0.8 percent used LSD; and 0.4 percent used cocaine.  In October 2017, CONALTID, the EU and UNODC launched a “Listen First” campaign aimed at preventing the abuse of drugs by children, focusing on parents, prevention staff, health workers, teachers, and decision makers.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 118  There are approximately 80 drug treatment and rehabilitation centers in Bolivia.  According to the Bolivian government’s 2016-2020 Strategy to Combat Drug Trafficking and Reduction of Excess Cultivation of Coca Leaf, 98 percent of those centers are run by nongovernmental organizations.  There are only two public treatment centers, one in Tarija and one in Santa Cruz.    4.  Corruption  As a matter of official policy, the Government of Bolivia does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking.  However, President Morales and other senior government officials have acknowledged serious corruption problems in the judiciary and police.  In 2017, the Ministry of Anticorruption and Transparency was dismantled and its responsibilities transferred to the Ministry of Justice, which was thereafter named the Ministry of Justice and Transparency.   FELCN is the only police unit with a known polygraph program.  All FELCN members are required to take an annual polygraph test, and those who do not pass are supposed to transfer out of the program.  However, reports vary as to whether those two requisites are uniformly applied.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States Embassy meets periodically with the Vice Ministry for Social Defense and Controlled Substances and FELCN officials to discuss Bolivia’s drug control efforts.  Bolivia sent participants to five courses at the U.S.-funded International Law Enforcement Academy in 2018.  The participants represented two Bolivian institutions: FELCN and the Financial Investigative Unit.  The United States does not have a counterdrug presence in Bolivia, but it consults with international organizations and third-country governments involved in supporting Bolivian drug control goals and efforts to strengthen the rule of law.   Bolivia participated in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in May, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  In conjunction with the Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit, the Vice Minister of Social Defense visited the State Department and requested continued cooperation and exchange of information of eradication imagery and data.  D.  Conclusion   Bolivia remains the third largest source of coca and cocaine in the world, and a major transit country for Peruvian cocaine.  For the second time since 2010, UNODC estimates coca cultivation is increasing and, even with a decrease in U.S. coca cultivation estimates, both UNODC and U.S. 2017 estimates are well above the government-sanctioned limit of 22,000 ha.  Despite a decrease in U.S. estimates in 2017, potential pure cocaine production in Bolivia remains historically high at 249 MT when compared to 170 MT less than a decade ago.  There is no available data to support the Bolivian government’s statements that traditional, cultural, and medicinal coca consumption have increased, which it made in justifying the increase in the legal limit of coca cultivation in the new General Law on Coca from 12,000 ha to 22,000 ha.  This \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 119  limit exceeds the amount of coca needed for traditional purposes by approximately 38 percent, per EU reporting.  Bolivia’s inadequate controls over its legal coca markets remain a matter of concern, as is Bolivia’s status as a transit country for cocaine trafficking.  In 2013, Bolivia re-acceded to the 1961 U.N. Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs with a reservation permitting coca to be used only within Bolivia for traditional, cultural, and medicinal purposes.  Despite these stated conditions, Bolivia continues to promote the use of coca in other countries and discuss potential export opportunities for coca products.  These actions undermine Bolivia’s commitments to its international drug control obligations.  In addition, Bolivia should strengthen efforts to stem the diversion of coca to cocaine processing by tightening controls over the coca leaf trade, achieving net reductions in coca cultivation, and improving law enforcement and judicial efforts to investigate and prosecute drug-related criminal activity.  Provisions of the new Controlled Substances Law are still not in effect nor will they be until the Bolivian legislature approves the implementing regulations.  The law nonetheless could be a significant advance in the fight against drug trafficking, as it will institutionalize the use of modern investigative techniques previously absent from the Bolivian legal framework.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 120  Bosnia and Herzegovina  Bosnia and Herzegovina is not a major producer or consumer of illicit drugs or precursor chemicals.  It is primarily a transit country, positioned between drug processing centers in Southwest Asia and markets in Western Europe.  The Adriatic coast is also a major gateway for South American cocaine destined for Europe.   Transnational criminal organizations dominate the drug trade in the Balkans and largely traffic cannabis, heroin, and cocaine.  Bosnian criminal organizations often operate outside of the Balkans, though leaders of these organizations reside within the country.  Law enforcement and security institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina remain limited and do not effectively deter trafficking.  The fragmented structure of law enforcement agencies and inter-agency rivalries impede effective cooperation in detecting drug crimes and pursuing joint investigations.  There is little coordination between units that could connect drug activity to larger organized crime and money laundering operations.  Little political will exists to create policies and programs to reduce demand for illicit drugs.  Corruption is an endemic problem, which can also hamper effective investigations and prosecutions.  Drug demand is increasing within Bosnia and Herzegovina, but remains relatively low compared with other European countries.  During the first 10 months of 2018, police seized 3.35 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 2.7 kg of cocaine; 1.84 metric tons of marijuana/cannabis products; 2,500 tablets of cannabis sativa and 8,998 cannabis plants; 23.9 kg and 10.6 liters of amphetamine-type stimulants; 1,605 tablets and 17.7 kg of MDMA (ecstasy); and 67,968 tablets of diverted pharmaceutical products.  Many of these seizures resulted from joint investigations with neighboring countries.   Nationally, the State Investigation and Protection Agency (SIPA) and the Border Police are responsible for drug control enforcement.  The Customs Administration, within the Indirect Taxation Authority, conducts routine drug seizures at border crossings but does not possess investigative or arrest authorities.  Seized drugs are transferred to either the Border Police or SIPA for criminal investigation and prosecution.  At the entity-level, the Federation Ministry of Interior, Republika Srpska Ministry of Interior, Brcko District Police, and the 10 cantonal Ministries of Interior are engaged on drug issues.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Bosnian police filed 2,014 reports related to drug crimes.  Bosnia and Herzegovina law enforcement agencies’ ability to conduct complex investigations is limited.  Bosnia and Herzegovina continues to work closely with the United States to develop its interdiction, investigative, and prosecutorial capacity, and also cooperates with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime, and other bilateral partners.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 121  Brazil  A.  Introduction  Brazil is a significant transit and destination country for cocaine.  The country’s borders with the cocaine source countries of Colombia, Peru, and Bolivia are porous and over three times the length of the U.S. border with Mexico.  The government views the large, violent, and well-organized drug trafficking organizations operating throughout the country as its primary domestic security threat.  Brazil suffers from a substantial and growing domestic drug consumption problem.  After the United States, Brazil is the world’s second-largest consumer of cocaine hydrochloride and likely the largest consumer of cocaine-base products.  The Brazilian government appreciates the gravity of the illicit drugs issue and is committed to combating drug trafficking, but lacks the capacity to fully stem the flow of illicit drugs across its borders.  In 2018, Brazil entered into another year of economic recession and fiscal short-fall, combined with inflation, resulting in austerity cuts across the government, including at enforcement and social welfare agencies that address drug flows and substance use disorders.  The government continues to prioritize border security and pursues a whole-of-government approach to counter drug trafficking and other forms of organized and violent crime, working in cooperation with international partners.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1. Institutional Development    The Brazilian government’s lead agency for combating drug trafficking is the Federal Police (DPF).  The lead agency for policy on reducing drug demand is the National Secretariat for Drug Policy (SENAD).  SENAD is part of the Ministry of Justice, the Brazilian government’s lead agency for drug control policy.  The DPF’s 2018 budget increased by 18 percent, a significant increase over 2017 levels.  However, DPF operations continued to be impacted by across-the-board fiscal austerity and deep cuts to some operational budgets.  The DPF is capable by global standards, but recognizes that its force of 11,000 agents is insufficient to effectively combat drug trafficking in addition to other duties.  SENAD’s National Anti-Drug Fund budget was cut by 11 percent from 2017 levels.  Reform of drug sentencing laws is a source of public debate, as nearly a quarter of the Brazilian prison population is incarcerated for drug-related crimes (150,000 people), more than any other single crime.  The National Justice Council, which oversees Brazil’s federal judiciary, is creating standardized sentencing guidelines to better distinguish between drug consumers and traffickers.  Brazil maintains bilateral drug control agreements with the United States and every country in South America, in addition to formal partnerships with the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, and INTERPOL.  In May, the United States and Brazil launched a Permanent Security Forum to facilitate bilateral cooperation and plan coordinated strategies in six areas, \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 122  including drug trafficking.  Brazil has extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States.     2.  Supply Reduction    Brazil remains a major transit route for cocaine from the source countries of Bolivia, Colombia, and Peru.  Cocaine products are smuggled across land borders via small aircraft and trucks, as well as by boats using the Amazon riverine system.  Brazil's seaports play a key role in drug smuggling, and Brazilian law enforcement and customs continue to improve port screening and interdiction.  The majority of cocaine entering Brazil is destined for its domestic market and Europe, often through West Africa.  In August, Brazilian police in conjunction with United States law enforcement seized 2.2 metric tons (MT) of cocaine from a drug trafficking organization in Belém, Para destined for Antwerp, Belgium.  In September, Brazilian police cooperated with United States law enforcement to seize 840 kilograms of cocaine HCL base in Manaus, Amazonas destined for transport to the port of Belém at the mouth of the Amazon River.    Since 2011, Brazil’s Strategic Border Plan has confronted drug trafficking and transnational crime, including support of periodic operations.  Operation Sentinela, supervised by the Ministry of Justice, is an ongoing intelligence-building effort to coordinate state, local, and federal police forces, particularly on the border.  Operation Ágata, coordinated by the Ministry of Defense, conducts periodic tactical missions at strategic border points.  These operations took place periodically in 2018 with some success, but consolidated seizure statistics were not available at the time of this report.  In April, Brazil approved the Strategic Plan of the Integrated Border Program, established in November 2016 to improve cooperation among agencies and with international partners.  The first nine months of 2018 saw an increase of counter drug operations and seizures of cocaine and other illicit drugs, though aggregate volumes have not yet been made available.  A lack of a central uniformed reporting system makes consolidated statistical data difficult to attain.    Brazil conducts recurring cannabis eradication operations in the country’s northeast.  In a single operation in June, the DPF eradicated approximately 2.5 hectares of cannabis plantings, with an estimated yield of 88 MT.  Comprehensive statistics for cannabis eradication in 2018 have not yet been released.  Synthetic drugs are present in Brazil, though combating them is a lower government priority given the overwhelming cocaine problem.  Complex synthetic drugs such as MDMA and LSD are usually smuggled in small amounts via couriers flying commercial airlines from Europe.  A study published in June based on data from the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) showed an increase of opioid sales by 465 percent in Brazil between 2009 and 2015, including fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 123  Brazilian federal and state authorities continued to actively promote drug threat awareness, demand reduction, and treatment programs in 2018.  The government continues to implement its 2005 National Drug Policy via its regular budget process, with emphasis on distance-learning training for substance use disorder professionals and civil society organizations and building social service capacity at the municipal level.  In 2018, SENAD approved a new resolution that provides for studies to realign the National Drug Policy.   Brazil approaches the reintegration of people with substance use disorders into society holistically, providing a range of services from medical care to job training. Brazil’s programs are not yet commensurate with the size of the addicted population.   4.  Corruption   As a matter of government policy, the Brazilian government does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking, and there is little evidence to suggest that senior government officials are engaged in such activity.  While there were numerous allegations and examples of political corruption throughout Brazil, including at the highest levels of government, there were no direct links between political corruption and drug trafficking at the national level.  Delays in judicial proceedings often resulted in cases being dismissed.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The 2008 U.S.-Brazil Memorandum of Understanding on Narcotics Control and Law Enforcement supports capacity building in Brazilian federal and state agencies to combat illicit drug trafficking.  In 2018, the United States provided significant training support to Brazilian law enforcement through 29 courses reaching nearly 1,000 officers on topics ranging from money laundering to community policing.  Cooperation between Brazilian and U.S. law enforcement is excellent.  The United States also regularly engages with Brazilian security forces and the Brazil Navy to strengthen cooperation against drug trafficking through subject matter expert exchanges, forums, and other engagements.  The U.S.-Brazil Permanent Security Forum on Security launched in May 2018 as a formal mechanism to coordinate six thematic areas of cooperation, including drug trafficking.  The drug trafficking working group convened in September.    D.  Conclusion  Brazil has institutionalized its commitment to combating illicit drug trafficking and addressing a growing domestic consumption problem.  Brazil would benefit from comprehensive population surveys to determine the scope of its domestic drug consumption, consolidated nationwide data on drug interdiction, increased monitoring of its seaports, and greater cooperation with neighboring countries. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 124  Burma  A.  Introduction  Burma continues to be a major source of illicit opiates and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  According to the UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Burma is the world’s second largest source country of opium poppy cultivation, and one of the largest producers of heroin.  Burma is also one of the world’s largest producers of methamphetamine, primarily in the forms of crystallized methamphetamine and “yaba” tablets (caffeine with small doses of methamphetamine).  In 2018, countries across Southeast Asia and beyond experienced record-breaking seizures of crystal methamphetamine and yaba tablets that originated in Burma.  Production sites for heroin and ATS are generally situated in Shan State along Burma’s eastern borders in areas controlled by ethnic armed groups and militias.  There are also mobile ATS laboratories along the Burma-Bangladesh border, which have created another hub for ATS trafficking.  Precursor chemicals are brought to these production sites from outside the country, primarily from China.   Illicit drugs produced in Burma are trafficked throughout the region, with routes extending beyond the Mekong countries to Australia and New Zealand.  Burma is not a major source of or transit country for drugs entering the United States.  Domestic consumption of illicit drugs is substantial and widespread, though it varies by region.  However, there are no reliable comprehensive studies providing statistics on the scope of the problem.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development  The Central Committee for Drug Abuse Control (CCDAC) is Burma’s interagency mechanism for coordinating drug control efforts, which involve multiple ministries and justice institutions.  In February 2018, the CCDAC passed and enacted a National Drug Control Policy in accordance with recommendations from the 2016 UN General Assembly Special Session on the World Drug Problem (UNGASS).  The 1993 Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law was amended in February 2018 to be consistent with the new policy.  Burma’s Drug Enforcement Division (DED) is the country’s primary interdiction force, but it lacks resources commensurate with the size of the problem.  Burma’s justice system is underdeveloped, and judicial and prosecutorial institutions lack the legal framework to effectively handle the volume of drug-related crimes and complex drug networks.  The DED is theoretically allotted nearly 4,000 employees; however, as of August 2018, there were only 1,164 employees on staff.  The country’s criminal legislation does not permit law enforcement actions that are essential for sophisticated narcotics investigations, such as controlled deliveries.  Accordingly, there have been few investigations and prosecutions of mid- or high-ranking drug trafficking suspects.  In June 2018, President Win Myint ordered the establishment of a Drug Abuse Reporting Department within his office to identify drug offenders.  While the initiative shows a growing \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 125  recognition of drug use and trafficking in the country, it has thus far not provided law enforcement with the tools or resources necessary to interdict significant drug networks.    The Ministry of Social Welfare, Relief, and Resettlement (MSW) and the Ministry of Health and Sports (MOHS) share responsibilities for addressing drug treatment, and rehabilitation.  The MSW established a new Department of Rehabilitation in January 2018 to oversee rehabilitation facilities and services.  The Government of Burma recognizes that the social sector remains significantly underfunded, and that the country still lacks a corps of health and social welfare officials qualified to provide services to those using or addicted to drugs.    The amended Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Law places more focus on treating drug use as a public health matter rather than exclusively as a criminal justice matter.  However, law enforcement authorities continue primarily to arrest and prosecute low-level users and traffickers due to inadequate resources and poor understanding of the new law, as well as limited access to health services for drug users.  The majority of tips sent to the Drug Abuse Reporting Department concern low-level drug dealers, and the burden for handling these cases falls on law enforcement, justice, and correctional institutions.  According to CCDAC reports, 48 percent of prisoners nationwide were arrested for drug-related offences; in Kachin and Shan States, this figure is closer to 70 or 80 percent.  The Union Attorney General’s Office (UAGO) has estimated that as many as 50 percent of all cases prosecuted nationwide relate to drug offenses.     The UAGO oversees all prosecutions in the country, and consults on legislation in the criminal justice field.  Prosecutors below the Union level work in 14 state and regional, 71 district, and 330 township level law offices.  In addition to the lack of resources and rudimentary investigative techniques, they face challenges including: inconsistent testimony from civilian witnesses; the requirement to have a township elder present during a search warrant; and a lack of by-laws for implementation of the Narcotics Law.  The UAGO recognizes the benefits of police-prosecutor cooperation on investigations and prosecutions.  However, there has been no specialized drug prosecution training to date, and prosecutors receive drug cases after the police have already completed their investigations, without prior consultations, which makes prosecutions more difficult.    Burma’s law enforcement and justice institutions have the ability, in principle, to cooperate internationally.  However, due to lack of experience and exposure to international institutions, local law enforcement and judicial officials have limited understanding of regulations relating to extraditions and mutual legal assistance.  On a working level, DED officers and commanders maintain relationships with counterparts in neighboring countries, most notably Thailand and China.  Burma signed new agreements related to drug control in 2018; in addition, Burma is undergoing the process to sign memoranda of understanding with Indonesia and the Philippines on law enforcement cooperation.     2.  Supply Reduction  According to the 2017 UNODC Burma Opium Survey, an estimated 41,000 hectares of opium poppy were cultivated in Shan and Kachin States, representing a 25 percent decrease from to the results of the 2015 survey.  Shan State remains the largest source of opium cultivation.  The \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 126  Burmese government and UNODC are conducting a survey for the 2018 opium poppy season, the results of which are expected to be released in early 2019.  DED officials anticipate that opium and heroin production will continue to decline due to low opium prices and reduced regional demand for opium and heroin.  During the first nine months of 2018, Burmese authorities seized approximately 84,148,000 ATS tablets; 2.57 metric tons (MT) of opium; 750.6 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 2.68 MT of crystal methamphetamine; 72.2 kg of concentrated opium; 29.7 kg of low-grade opium; 1.97 liters of opium oil liquid; 353.5 kg of brown opium powder; and 11.65 liters of liquid opium.  At three drug destruction ceremonies on June 26 marking the annual International Day Against Drug Abuse, law enforcement officers destroyed $187 million worth of seized narcotic drugs, a reduction of more than 50 percent compared to the $386 million worth of seized illicit drugs destroyed in 2017.    During the first nine months of 2018, there were 14,008 drug-related arrests, compared to 13,734 arrests during the entire year in 2017.  As of September 30, there had been 9,784 drug-related prosecutions, compared to 9,366 in all of 2017.  In January, law enforcement officials seized 30 million methamphetamine pills and more than two metric tons of crystal methamphetamine and heroin in Shan State.  This single seizure, worth $54 million on the illicit market, was the largest of the year.  Drug traffickers are consolidating larger volumes of drugs for transport, compared to small retail trafficking in the past.  In June 2018, 12 drug traffickers received prison sentences up to 48 years in connection with a 2015 case involving the largest single seizure ever of ATS in Southeast Asia (and second largest in the world), worth $26.7 million.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  The Ministry of Home Affairs did not grant the CCDAC permission to develop Burma’s first National Drug Use Survey in 2018, despite an agreement with UNODC and the United States to support and fund the project.  Anecdotally, domestic consumption of illicit drugs is extremely high, especially associated with migrant workers in extractive industries, such as jade and gold mines.  The country’s existing public health capacity falls far short of accommodating those who seek or need treatment.    The government, with technical support from UNODC, adopted the first National Drug Control Policy in February 2018.  The policy references international best practices and aligns with the approach of the 2016 UNGASS and complies with the three international drug conventions.      The MOHS and the MSW rely on the international community to provide much of the training on drug treatment and prevention that health and education professionals receive.  The United States continues to fund the Colombo Plan, which trains health professionals on the U.S.-developed Universal Treatment Curriculum for Substance Use Disorders and teachers from the Ministry of Education on the Universal Prevention Curriculum.  Basic education teachers received drug prevention curriculum assistance for the first time in 2018, and expressed eagerness to benefit from additional capacity-building programs.  The United States also \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 127  provides support through local organizations to deliver effective training in life skills and behavior change interventions as well as link drug users to various services, including detoxification, methadone maintenance, HIV testing and AIDS treatments.  The United States also supports drug use prevention through community engagement activities, including a successful Facebook social media campaign.  The MOHS National Methadone Maintenance Therapy Program opened four new sites in 2018 and now has a total of 55 sites nationwide.  Currently, there are 26 major and 47 minor drug treatment centers, and the Government of Burma plans to open an additional three major and nine minor centers.  Significant challenges remain to reaching rural and remote communities.  The U.S. government has donated health and recreational materials to the CCDAC rehabilitation center, and worked with local authorities in 2018 to launch Kachin State’s Drug Use Prevention Strategic Plan.  A similar plan is in development for northern Shan State.   4.  Corruption  The Government of Burma does not, as a matter of policy, encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of drugs, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  However, corruption is widespread in Burma, and illicit proceeds from the drug trade fuel corruption.    The Anti-Corruption Commission has made important strides in building capacity to identify and investigate corruption, and has initiated important cases.  However, it still lacks the resources to lead a systematic fight against corruption.  Government officials participate regularly in conferences and trainings on corruption and related topics sponsored by international partners.    C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  CCDAC, in collaboration with UNODC, developed Burma’s first modern National Drug Control Policy in 2018, which presents a comprehensive approach to tackling the drug situation, involving government, non-government, and civil society stakeholders.  In addition to law enforcement and criminal justice efforts, it includes health and social policy responses, outlining a path to promoting sustainable alternative development for opium poppy farmers, and promoting international cooperation.  Major changes in this policy include increasing compliance with international standards of human rights.    In August 2017, Burma signed an amended Letter of Agreement with the United States that facilitates broadened engagement in law enforcement, drug control, and rule of law issues.    The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) continues to work closely with the DED on operations and the collaboration has expanded to regional level cooperation in forms of intelligence sharing and conducting joint investigations.  However, the government’s ongoing objections to Leahy vetting for in-country police training has hindered U.S. efforts to conduct in-country capacity building trainings.  DEA provided joint interdiction training for Burmese and Thai law enforcement officials in late 2018, and introduced specialized technical equipment to assist Burmese officials in interdicting and analyzing drug shipments.  During the year, 38 law \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 128  enforcement officials attended 16 courses at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok.  Burmese law enforcement officials also participated in additional international training opportunities, including courses pertaining to illicit drugs; cyber-enabled crime; and crimes against children.    D.  Conclusion  The scale of Burma’s drug problem – the consumption and trafficking of illicit opiates and ATS – is enormous.  Domestic consumption is widespread and degrades many communities.  Burma is a major source of illicit drugs throughout Southeast Asia, and illicit proceeds from the trade threaten political stability in many places.  Burma requires legal and organizational reforms to facilitate effective criminal investigations and transparent criminal prosecutions, and the country needs to dedicate resources to building law enforcement capacity to investigate and effectively prosecute drug traffickers and interdict drugs and precursor chemicals in order to see improvements in the future.  The United States remains a close partner with the Government of Burma on all elements of the country’s drug control policy and will continue to work with regional and international partners to help the country address its challenges.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 129  Cabo Verde  Cabo Verde remains an important transit hub for cocaine, cannabis, and small amounts of other drugs trafficked from Latin America to Europe.  The archipelago’s extensive maritime territory, minimal interdiction resources, and remote parts of its 10 islands make Cabo Verde vulnerable to trafficking via aerial and maritime conveyance.  Tourist and business traffic continues to expand through the major international airports on the islands of Santiago and Sal and the secondary airports on the islands of Boa Vista and Sao Vicente, expanding opportunities for drug trafficking via human couriers.  Expanding cargo and cruise ship traffic through the country’s major ports on Santiago, Sao Vicente, and Sal also increase opportunities for drug trafficking.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime reports that cannabis, cocaine, hashish, heroin, and methamphetamine are the most commonly used illicit drugs in Cabo Verde.  There are reports that synthetic drugs including MDMA (ecstasy) are available on the tourist destination islands of Sal and Boa Vista.   Corruption is relatively low in Cabo Verde.  Support from the United States and other international donors is helping to improve the capacity of Cabo Verdean law enforcement agencies to identify and interdict illicit drug shipments.  U.S. support has also increased Cabo Verde’s ability to combat money laundering and other financial crimes often associated with drug trafficking.  There are few drug demand reduction programs active in the country, and recidivism for drug crimes is a major problem.   In August 2017, police seized a reported 1,157 kilogram shipment of cocaine from a private yacht in Mindelo, headed from Brazil to Europe.  The crew, three Brazilians and a French national, were found guilty and are serving a 10-year sentence.   The United States and other partners support Cabo Verde in combating drug trafficking and associated crime, providing robust and varied training to law enforcement and armed forces in Cabo Verde.  The Center for Maritime Security Operations (COSMAR) in Praia and the Joint Operations Center in Mindelo provide oversight of Cabo Verde’s maritime territory.  U.S. Africa Command partners with Cabo Verdean authorities on periodic patrols in the region to interdict suspected drug shipments and other illicit activities, as well as providing training and building capacity within Cabo Verdean security sector institutions.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 130  Canada  A.  Introduction   The Government of Canada continued to combat the production, distribution, and consumption of illicit drugs in 2018.  Canada and the United States cooperate extensively in drug control efforts, including by sharing information and coordinating operations.  Canada is a source of MDMA (ecstasy), cannabis, and fentanyl to the United States.  Canada aggressively targets the trafficking of synthetic and conventional drugs, particularly fentanyl and fentanyl precursors.   B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development   Canada’s national drug control policy is codified by the Canadian Drugs and Substances Strategy (CDSS), which was announced in 2016 and includes four pillars – prevention, treatment, harm reduction and enforcement.  The Strategy has a five-year budget (2017-2022) of $660 million.  Provinces and territories have separate dedicated budgets to address problematic substance use.    In May 2017, Canada’s Parliament passed Bill C-37, amending the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.  The bill authorized temporary scheduling to control dangerous emerging drugs and streamlined the process for establishing supervised consumption sites.  It also prohibits unregistered importation of devices that could be used to manufacture controlled substances, such as pill presses and encapsulators, and authorizes Canadian border officers to open mail weighing 30 grams or less that may contain controlled substances.    Effective October 17, 2018, the production, sale, and use of recreational cannabis (Cannabis Act) became legal throughout Canada.  However, under this legislation, unauthorized cross-border movement of cannabis remains subject to criminal prosecution.   Canada continued to experience a growing number of opioids-related overdose deaths, with over 8,000 deaths since 2016, including 3,996 in 2017; there were more than 1,000 apparent opioid-related deaths during the first quarter of 2018.   Canada is party to the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, and the Inter-American Convention against Corruption.  The Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP) is a member of the International Narcotics Control Board's (INCB) Task Forces, including Project ION (International Operation on New Psychoactive Substances).    2.  Supply Reduction   Canada is a primary source of cannabis and MDMA to the United States, and a source of synthetic drugs and amphetamine-type stimulants to Asia and Australia.  Synthetic opioids have also reached the United States from Canada.  Cannabis cultivation and synthetic drug manufacture are concentrated in British Columbia, Quebec, and Ontario.  Methamphetamine also continues to be produced in Canada.  South America remains Canada’s primary source for \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 131  cocaine, some of which transits the United States.  Afghanistan remains Canada’s primary source of heroin.      Canadian officials report that the volume of fentanyl trafficked from China decreased in 2018, and the majority of fentanyl seizures were trafficked in powder form through the postal stream with minimal concealment.  During the first six months of 2018, Canada seized 20 fentanyl shipments totaling 1.28 kilograms (kg) in powder form.  In 2017, there were 113 seizures for a total of 11.95 kg seized in powder form.    3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   The Substance Use and Addictions Program is a federal program under the CDSS.  It provides $28.3 million annually to Canada’s provinces, territories, non-governmental organizations and other stakeholders, particularly for activities and research to combat the opioid crisis.   The Canadian government produces and implements various public education materials and campaigns to inform Canadians about the health and safety risks of using dangerous drugs and substances, including opioids, and cannabis.  One of the government’s priorities is to reduce the negative stigma associated with seeking mental health services and treatment for substance use disorders.  Health Canada plans to invest more than $350 million annually in community programming to help address the mental wellness needs of First Nations and Inuit populations.   Canada’s comprehensive approach to substance use involved various harm reduction initiatives, including: needle exchange programs; supervised consumption sites; overdose prevention sites; and legislation to protect individuals seeking emergency assistance for overdoses.  Canada also supports medication-assisted therapies for the treatment of opioid dependence, and naloxone is widely available without a prescription, including in all First Nations primary health care centers.    According to the INCB, Canada is the second largest per capita consumer of prescription opioids in the world.  In 2015, 13 percent of Canadians aged 15 years and older reported using an opioid pain reliever in the past year.  Among them, 2 percent reported abusing opioids, a decrease from 2012 (5 percent).      The Government collects substance use prevalence data through the Canadian Tobacco Alcohol and Drugs Survey and the Canadian Student Tobacco, Alcohol and Drugs Survey.  The most recent data showed the prevalence of cannabis use among Canadians aged 15 years and older was 16 percent in 2018, up from 2013 (11 percent).  In 2016-17, 17 percent of students in grades 7 to 12 (approximately 340,000) reported using cannabis in the year preceding the survey, unchanged from 2014-15.  Use of other illicit drugs such as MDMA (0.4 percent), hallucinogens (0.6 percent), cocaine (0.9 percent) and methamphetamine (0.2 percent) remained largely unchanged since 2004.      4.  Corruption   Canada has strong anti-corruption laws and policies and holds its officials to a high standard of conduct.  The Canadian government pursues malfeasant civil servants and subjects them to \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 132  prosecution.  No government officials are known to engage in, encourage, or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking.  Corruption among law enforcement officials is rare.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   The United States and Canada exchange forfeited assets through a bilateral asset-sharing agreement and share information on customs offenses through a customs mutual assistance agreement.  Judicial assistance and extradition matters operate under a mutual legal assistance treaty, an extradition treaty, and related domestic legislation and law-enforcement protocols, including a memorandum of understanding (MOU) between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and RCMP.    U.S. federal, state, local, and tribal entities collaborate with RCMP, Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), provincial and local police, and other Canadian law enforcement authorities to combat drug trafficking.  Cooperation is coordinated through the Cross Border Law Enforcement Advisory Committee, Joint Management Teams, and other bilateral groups.  Integrated teams of Canadian and U.S. law enforcement authorities operate along the Northern Border across a variety of structures, including Border Enforcement Security Taskforces (BEST), Integrated Border Enforcement Teams (IBET), and the Integrated Cross-Border Maritime Law Enforcement Operations (aka \"Shiprider\").    Canada participates with the United States and Mexico in the North American Dialogue on Drug Policy (NADD).  On November 9, 2018, Canada hosted the third annual high-level NADD in Ottawa.  Canada also takes part in the North American Maritime Security Initiative, a joint operations and information sharing effort to target suspect vessels.  Through a longstanding MOU, U.S. Coast Guard detachments are deployed on Canadian Navy ships in the Caribbean Sea and Eastern Pacific Ocean, which resulted in the seizure of over 3.64 metric tons of cocaine during the first six months of 2018.   D.  Conclusion   The United States cooperates extensively with Canada on law enforcement matters and acknowledges the strong and consistent anti-drug efforts of Canada’s federal government.  The United States will continue to work with Canada to stem the flow of illegal drugs across our shared border and enhance regulatory frameworks to prevent access to precursor chemicals and lab equipment for criminal use.         \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 133  China  A.  Introduction  China's geographical location, vast land area, massive population, and expanding economy have all contributed to the country becoming a hub for drug and precursor chemical production and trafficking.  China also faces significant illicit drug consumption challenges, including synthetic drugs.  China shares borders with drug source countries in both Southeast and Southwest Asia and remains a major destination and transit country for heroin produced in these areas.  Its numerous coastal cities with high-volume seaports and its vast network of major international airports make China an ideal destination and transit country for illicit drugs.  China is a major source of synthetic drugs, new psychoactive substances (NPS), and precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs.  Domestic Chinese criminal organizations traffic illicit drugs within China as well as to international markets, and Chinese authorities have noted the presence of international drug trafficking organizations originating from Mexico and Southeast Asia operating within the country.   China is a major source of NPS and other synthetic drugs, including fentanyl and methamphetamine, and domestic use of synthetic drugs (primarily methamphetamine and ketamine) is becoming increasingly prevalent.  China's large chemical and pharmaceutical industries provide an ideal environment for the illicit production and export of these drugs.  According to U.S. and international law enforcement sources, China remains a major source of NPS seized in North America and Europe, which are often purchased via the internet and shipped to overseas customers.  Chemical alterations of scheduled drugs to circumvent existing anti-drug laws have hampered efforts to stem the flow of these drugs.  The current opioid crisis in the United States underlines the importance of bilateral U.S.-Chinese drug control cooperation.  Based on U.S. Customs and Border Protection seizure data, China is the principal source country of illicit fentanyl and fentanyl-related compounds in the United States, including both scheduled and non-scheduled substances.  The challenges posed by trafficking via the internet and small parcel trafficking patterns are formidable and will test the cooperative spirit and ingenuity of law enforcement authorities in both countries.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  China’s drug control strategy focuses on prevention, education, illicit crop eradication, interdiction, rehabilitation, commercial regulation, and law enforcement.  The Ministry of Public Security (MPS) National Narcotics Control Commission (NNCC) is the primary national drug enforcement entity and works in conjunction with provincial public security bureau offices.  The Anti-Smuggling Bureau within the General Administration of Customs is responsible for the enforcement of China’s drug control laws at seaports, airports, and land border checkpoints.  China maintains bilateral drug control agreements with many countries and international organizations, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, and participates in a variety of international drug conferences and bilateral meetings.  There is no extradition treaty \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 134  between China and the United States.  China and the United States signed a bilateral mutual legal assistance agreement in 2000, which entered into force in 2001.  Despite the existence of a mutual legal assistance agreement, many outstanding requests by both the United States and China remained unfulfilled.     2.  Supply Reduction  According to the NNCC's 2017 Annual Drug Report (published June 2018), Chinese law enforcement investigated 140,000 drug – related cases, including 102,000 trafficking-related investigations and made 169,000 drug related arrests in 2017, a slight increase over the previous year.  Chinese authorities also targeted clandestine labs used to produce NPS and other synthetic drugs, illicit drugs, and precursors, destroying 317 clandestine laboratories, arresting 1,345 suspects, and seizing 2,384 metric tons (MT) of precursor chemicals in 2017, an increase of 50 percent over the previous year.  In 2017, Chinese authorities seized a total of 89.2 MT of illicit drugs, including 9.5 MT of heroin (an increase of 8 percent), 28.2 MT of methamphetamine (a decrease of 3 percent), and 7.3 MT of ketamine (a decrease of 30 percent).  In February 2018, China added two fentanyl precursors, NPP and 4-ANPP, to the controlled substances schedule.  In August, China scheduled an additional 32 NPS, including two fentanyl analogues, bringing the total number of controlled NPS and related precursors to 175 and the total number of controlled fentanyl analogues to 25.  During the reporting period, the NNCC initiated “equipment control” measures requiring the registration of nuclear magnetic resonance spectrometry equipment that could be used in synthetic drug production.  The NNCC identified the emergence of new types of NPS as a particular challenge.  According to China’s National Narcotics Laboratory, 230 types of NPS, including 34 previously unidentified substances, were found in China during 2018.  At the November 2018 Group of 20 summit, China announced plans to control all fentanyl-related substances as a class to get ahead of traffickers who switch to non-scheduled NPS as individual substances are scheduled.  No timeline for implementation had been announced by the end of 2018.    3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  According to NNCC, synthetic drugs – primarily methamphetamine and ketamine – have surpassed heroin and other opioids as China’s primary domestic drug threat.  In public statements, the NNCC identified the increase in NPS abuses cases as an emerging trend, and, in addition to ketamine, identified methcathinone and the synthetic cannabinoid JWH-018 as commonly abused NPS.  According to the NNCC's 2017 Annual Drug Report, the total number of registered illegal drug users in China is 2.553 million, but the actual number of drug abusers is estimated to be at least 14 million, according to media reports.  Of the reported registered drug users, 1.538 million (60.2 percent) reportedly used synthetic drugs, while 970,000 (38 percent) reportedly used opioids (e.g., heroin) and 46,000 (1.8 percent) reportedly used cocaine, cannabis, and other drugs.  According to NNCC, 18 to 35 year olds were the largest demographic among registered drug users (55.6 percent).  In 2018, 344,000 new registered drug users were identified, with synthetic drug abusers accounting for 77.1 percent of new registered drug users.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 135  In 2016, NNCC formulated and distributed its “Work Plan on Community-based Drug Treatment and Rehabilitation, 2016-2020” to further the development of a community-based drug treatment and recovery system.  The Plan supports NNCC efforts to combine methadone maintenance treatment and community-based drug treatment and recovery.  In addition to 770 clinics offering methadone maintenance treatment, China has in place 3,258 job placement sites and 29,000 township level offices responsible for community-based drug treatment and recovery work, employing 31,000 full-time community workers.  According to the NNCC annual report, China placed 321,000 drug users into compulsory rehabilitation, and ordered another 260,000 people for treatment at community rehabilitation centers.  NNCC has an outreach program to raise awareness of the negative health effects of illicit drug use and promote drug demand reduction.   4.  Corruption  The Ministry of Public Security takes allegations of drug-related corruption seriously, and launches investigations when deemed appropriate.  Despite efforts to stem drug-related corruption, financial corruption among provincial, prefectural, county, and district government officials continues to be a concern.  The Government of China does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  Based on publicly available information, no senior Chinese official at the central government level is known to have facilitated the illicit production or distribution of drugs in 2017.  Similarly, no senior Chinese official from the central government is known to have laundered proceeds from drug-related activities.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The U.S.-China Bilateral Drug Intelligence Working Group, the Counter Narcotics Working Group, and a group of chemists and experts meet annually to exchange information on drug trends; discuss laws, regulations, and policies; seek progress and address challenges in precursor chemical control; and improve cooperation on investigations of mutual interest.  The August scheduling of 32 NPS was a result of these working-level exchanges.  During the reporting period, Chinese and U.S. law enforcement agencies cooperated in several drug-related investigations and officials from both countries met frequently outside of the formal dialogue mechanisms to discuss practical cooperation.  D.  Conclusion  Drug control cooperation between the United States and China continues to improve through law enforcement operational cooperation and various working groups and consultative mechanisms.  While drug trafficking, manufacturing, diversion, and other drug-related crimes remain significant problems in China, the central government continues to take steps to integrate China into regional and global drug control efforts, as well as to address the country’s domestic drug problem through enforcement and rehabilitation.  U.S. law enforcement has made inroads in building working relationships with provincial public security bureaus, with oversight by central authorities, and relations continue to strengthen.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 136  In order to confront the emerging trend of NPS and stem the future flow of fentanyl and other synthetic opioids to the United States, China should implement and strictly enforce as soon as possible the announced class-based scheduling of fentanyl related substances.  China also should strengthen enforcement of chemical control laws to prevent the diversion of drug precursors to illicit drug manufacture.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 137  Colombia  A.  Introduction  Colombia is the world’s top producer and exporter of cocaine, as well as a source country of heroin and marijuana.  Colombian coca cultivation and cocaine production exceeded all-time record levels during 2017 (the most recent year for which data is available).  The United States estimates potential pure cocaine production increased by 19 percent, from 772 metric tons (MT) in 2016 to 921 MT in 2017.  The United States further estimates coca cultivation increased 11 percent from 188,000 hectares (ha) in 2016 to 209,000 ha in 2017.  On March 1, 2018, the U.S. and Colombian governments agreed to an ambitious Five-Year Goal to reduce Colombia’s coca cultivation and cocaine production by 50 percent by the end of 2023.  Since taking office on August 7, 2018, Colombian President Ivan Duque has endorsed this goal and instituted an aggressive plan for police and military to increase coca eradication, interdiction, and operations targeting criminal organizations to achieve the Five-Year Goal.  In December 2018, the Duque administration released its whole-of-government drug control strategy, which aims to reduce drug consumption, decrease supply, dismantle criminal organizations, disrupt illicit financial flows, and increase state presence and economic opportunity in poor rural areas where criminal organizations and coca cultivation thrive.    In 2018, the Colombian government took initial steps to increase efforts to reduce cocaine availability.  Colombia reported seizing or assisting with the seizure of over 450 MT of pure cocaine and cocaine base.  Coca eradication efforts increased, particularly since President Duque took office.  The Colombian government reported eradicating approximately 85,000 ha of coca during the calendar year through forced eradication and the crop substitution program, which resulted from the peace accord between the Colombian government and the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC).  By increasing eradication results, the Colombian government eliminated tons of potential cocaine from the drug supply chain.   According to the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), over 90 percent of the cocaine samples seized en route to and in the United States by U.S. law enforcement in 2017, and subjected to laboratory analysis, were of Colombian origin.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1. Institutional Development  Colombia’s 2016 peace accord with the FARC ended a 52-year conflict, established new institutions to pursue justice for past crimes, and set in motion a disarmament, demobilization, and reintegration process for FARC ex-combatants.  Colombia continues to struggle with persistent security, governance, and economic challenges in neglected rural regions vacated by the FARC.  The Colombian government recognizes the illicit drug trade and the organized criminal groups it empowers are the greatest threats to peace and security in Colombia.  The Colombian government suspended aerial eradication of coca in October 2015, but President Duque has publicly stated his intent to restart the use of aerial spray as a component of an \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 138  integrated drug control strategy that includes both manual and aerial eradication combined with interdiction, alternative development, and counter-criminal network operations.    2.  Supply Reduction  The United States estimates coca cultivation in Colombia increased 11 percent from 188,000 ha in 2016 to 209,000 ha in 2017.  In 2017, the Nariño department remained the leading coca-producing region in Colombia, with an estimated 46,000 ha, up from 39,500 ha in 2016.  Other top coca-producing departments also saw increases from 2016 to 2017:  Norte de Santander (from 36,000 ha to 42,800 ha); Cauca (from 32,000 ha to 39,000 ha); and Putumayo (from 19,500 ha to 21,000 ha).    Several factors contributed to the surge in coca cultivation in Colombia since 2013, including:  the end of aerial spray of glyphosate on coca; a crop substitution program that created perverse incentives for coca growers to grow more coca; and the failure of the FARC to comply with the illicit drug provisions of the peace agreement.  Drug traffickers employ effective counter-eradication tactics such as protests and the use of improvised explosive devices in coca fields to kill, injure, and demoralize eradicators and to slow eradication operations.  The Colombian government continued to make drug interdiction one of its drug control priorities, alongside investigating, prosecuting, and dismantling criminal groups and extraditing top drug traffickers to the United States.  Reducing the availability of illicit drugs requires a stable post-peace accord environment, the extension of citizen security and the rule of law throughout Colombia, economic development in rural areas, and the countering of illegal armed groups that have plagued Colombia for decades.  Colombian authorities, and third countries using Colombian intelligence, reported seizing over 450 MT of pure cocaine and cocaine base in 2018, as well as approximately 250 MT of marijuana, over 320 kilograms of heroin, and destroyed 3,855 cocaine base laboratories and 319 cocaine hydrochloride (HCl) laboratories.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  According to the most recent National Household Survey of Drug Consumption, from 2014, drug use in Colombia rose between 2008 and 2013, making Colombia the country with the fourth highest consumption of cocaine and marijuana in South America.  Previously, it had one of the lowest consumption rates in the region.  As of 2013, there were over three million consumers of all categories of illicit drugs in Colombia, of which around two million were in major cities including Bogota, Medellin, and Cali.  There are indications that drug use continues to increase among Colombian youth, with marijuana the substance of choice.  Use of inhalants and a cocaine by-product called “basuco” is high among those displaced by years of internal conflict in Colombia.  The Colombian National Police (CNP) has a prevention unit of 2,000 instructors who teach drug prevention to vulnerable schoolchildren nationwide.  On October 1, 2018, two months after assuming office, President Duque signed a decree instructing the CNP to confiscate any drugs held by individuals in public spaces and issue a fine.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 139  Legislation and judicial rulings previously allowed citizens to carry small amounts of marijuana and cocaine for personal use.  Colombia focuses treatment on youth substance abusers.  Acknowledging that severe criminal sanctions disproportionately affect the most vulnerable in the drug-trafficking chain and contribute to prison overcrowding, the Colombian government created a juvenile drug court in Medellin and is planning juvenile drug courts in five other departments.  The Colombian government is working to expand restorative justice programs and programs that teach life, leadership, and cultural skills to youth treatment and detention centers.  The Colombian government will begin training professionals in the U.S.-developed Universal Treatment Curriculum and Universal Prevention Curriculum in 2019.  These curricula will provide evidence-based methods for improving treatment and prevention within Colombia.   4.  Corruption  As a matter of policy, the Colombian government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor the laundering of proceeds of illicit drugs.  Nevertheless, corruption remains a significant problem.    There were a series of high-profile corruption cases in 2018, including in Colombia’s justice sector where at least three Supreme Court justices are under investigation for, or charged with, corruption related to their positions.  The Colombian Supreme Court recently convicted the chief anticorruption prosecutor for corruption.  The prosecution of such high-profile, powerful individuals can be seen as a reflection of strengthened justice institutions, which have the capacity, political will, and autonomy to investigate, prosecute, and adjudicate corruption.    Notwithstanding these notable corruption cases, the Colombian government has made significant strides in implementing its 2013 anticorruption strategy to improve transparency of, and public confidence in, government institutions.  The 2014 transparency and access to public information law was implemented in 2016, requiring all government entities to release information pertaining to salaries, management evaluations, the hiring processes, and the public budget.   The government held an August 2018 referendum on anticorruption measures that would have strengthened accountability and transparency measures such as public bidding for contracts and imposed harsher penalties for those convicted of corruption.  While the referendum failed to meet the participation threshold, among the 11.5 million Colombian citizens who voted, 99 percent voted in favor of the anticorruption measures.  Colombia benefits from an independent attorney general (Fiscal) and inspector general (Procurador), both of whom publicly identify anticorruption efforts as a priority for their institutions.  Between August 1, 2016 and October 30, 2018, the Attorney General’s office opened 2,332 corruption investigations, 788 of which were against current government employees.  Two-hundred and three of those were against judicial branch employees, including 106 investigations of current employees of the Attorney General’s office.  Another 550 were against former government employees and 994 were against private citizens.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 140  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  On December 13, 2018, the Duque administration released its counternarcotics strategy, which sets clear goals and mandates a whole-of-government approach in key drug supply regions of the country.  The strategy outlines four pillars that aim to reduce growing domestic consumption, decrease the supply of drugs, dismantle criminal organizations, and disrupt illicit financial flows.  It also focuses on increasing state presence and economic opportunity in poor rural areas where criminal organizations and coca cultivation thrive.  The strategy is an important step toward achieving the U.S.-Colombia bilateral goal to cut coca cultivation and cocaine production in Colombia by 50 percent by the end of 2023.  The United States provides counter-drug assistance to the CNP, the Colombian military, and judicial institutions, including the offices of the attorney general and inspector general, the judiciary, and the corrections system, which investigate, prosecute, and incarcerate drug traffickers and other criminals.  The United States supports integrated programs designed to expand Colombia’s rural policing capabilities, while enabling the transition of rural communities out of coca-based economies by expanding the presence of the state in post-conflict regions, strengthening licit market linkages (for example promoting alternative crops such as coffee, cacao, palm, fruits, and vegetables), and promoting the rule of law and protection of human rights.  A notable example of this whole-of-government approach is the “Antioquia Libre de Coca (Free of Coca)” initiative, which brings together national and local governments, police and military forces, and the private sector to achieve sustainable drug control and development objectives.  Antioquia was the only major coca-growing department to see a decrease in hectares under cultivation in 2017, according to U.S. government estimates.    Through the U.S.-Colombia Action Plan on Regional Security Cooperation, Colombia’s police and military export law enforcement capabilities and build regional connections by training Central America and Caribbean counterparts to counter transnational organized crime and drug trafficking.  The Action Plan expanded to include 415 activities in nine countries during 2017.  Bilateral maritime counterdrug cooperation, exercised under the Agreement to Suppress Illicit Traffic at Sea that was signed in 1997, continues to be one of the most effective in the region, enabling the seizure of over 146 MT of cocaine in 2016.  D.  Conclusion  The illicit drug situation in Colombia remains a top concern of the U.S. government.  The CNP and military forces have begun to increase efforts to stem coca cultivation and cocaine production.  Colombia can achieve the Five-Year Goal to cut coca cultivation and cocaine production by 50 percent by the end of 2023 through aggressive implementation of and resourcing for its new whole-of-government drug control strategy, which seeks to increase eradication, interdiction, and counter-network operations, as well as to achieve sustainability of short-term efforts through rural development.  Extradition remains a crucial tool against individuals involved in drug trafficking, and demonstrates the cooperative effort of Colombia and the United States.  The U.S. government stands by the Colombian government in its efforts to achieve our shared objectives to combat illicit drug cultivation and trafficking.  The U.S. government will continue to closely monitor the development and implementation of Colombia’s \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 141  drug control strategy to ensure progress is made to reduce the production and trafficking of illicit drugs.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 142  Costa Rica  A.  Introduction  Costa Rica’s strategic location, vast maritime territory, and the small size of its security forces combine to make it an attractive transit and logistics hub for illicit drug trafficking.  In 2018, Costa Rica remained one of the primary countries in the region for transshipment of cocaine to the United States.  During the first nine months of 2018, Costa Rican authorities seized a total of 22.3 metric tons (MT) of cocaine.     Though low for the region, the murder rate in Costa Rica surpassed 600 homicides in 2018, setting a new record for the third year in a row.  Continued turf war-related shootings and cartel-style assassinations have exacerbated heightened public concern and intensified the Costa Rican government’s sharp focus on the fight against illicit drug trafficking.    The government continued to increase its security spending in 2018, despite a severe fiscal crisis, allowing the hiring of more police officials across all services.  Institutional changes are also leading to additional police professionalization, major advances in investigations and prosecutions, and improved success in drug interdiction and disruption of drug trafficking organizations, as well as prevention programs.     B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development   The Costa Rican government enacted encouraging institutional changes to combat the heightened threats from illicit drugs.  The Ministry of Public Security’s (MPS) budget increased by five percent in 2018, on top of an 11 percent increase in 2017.  This was further boosted by a reinstated security tax on companies (in 2017) which now provides a new annual stream of extra-budgetary resources earmarked for security equipment and additional personnel.  As a result, the national police added 1,500 new officers between 2017 and 2018; the Coast Guard (SNG) grew by a third, the Border Police added officials; and the Air Surveillance Service (SVA) doubled its cadre of pilots and mechanics.  This represents continued growth in the capacity of the Costa Rican entities responsible for the majority drug seizures.       The government continued important police professionalization efforts in 2018, including outfitting a new police academy, upgrades in the tactical training site, and additional cooperation between national law enforcement agencies and those of local governments.   The reinstated security tax will also allow investment in new capabilities.  Through Foreign Military Sales (FMS), the government purchased a plane for $7.5 million that will be converted into the country’s first maritime patrol aircraft, which will be in service by late 2019.  Costa Rica also used its own funds to initiate a $9 million purchase of four highly capable interceptor/patrol boats for its Coast Guard, which will be delivered in 2019-2020.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 143  The SNG remained a highly effective regional partner for maritime interdiction, including a growing desire to develop joint operations with the U.S. Coast Guard (USCG).  The arrival of three U.S.-donated 110-foot USCG cutters in April 2018 transformed the SNG.  The cutters have been used to great effect, and without pause, to establish Costa Rica’s first blue-water patrol in the busiest cocaine transit zone – at a fraction of the cost of using U.S. assets.     Following on its success as the first lab in the region to receive international accreditation in key disciplines, the Costa Rican National Forensics lab was reaccredited in October 2018 for chemical analysis, toxicology, and biochemistry (including DNA testing), and successfully added ballistics.  This is the first lab in Central America to attain this top-level rating and only the third in the Latin American region (joining labs in Chile and Mexico).  The accreditation of the lab enhances the credibility of forensic evidence in the investigation and prosecution of cases, including cases of drug trafficking and crime and violence with linkages to drug trafficking.         The six-year-old Border Police improved control of Costa Rica’s porous land border with Panama, including much expanded use of biometrics and improved cooperation with Panama.  The Air Surveillance Service (SVA) pushed to better control its airspace using radar technology supported by the United States.  In December, a multi-year project was initiated to donate and nationalize four twin-engine transport helicopters, providing Costa Rica with the ability, for the first time, to insert law enforcement teams where needed to counter the use of illicit airfields.  The helicopters will also support maritime interdiction missions.  SVA’s support for the Coast Guard will further expand upon the arrival of the maritime patrol aircraft (in late 2019), and with improved capability for night-operations.  After a favorable constitutional court ruling in 2017, the government continued to expanded use of the Judicial Wire Intercept Program (JWIP) in 2018, and now boasts the largest JWIP capacity in Central America.     2.  Supply Reduction  During the first nine months of 2018, Costa Rica seized 22.3 MT of cocaine, already exceeding the amount seized during all of 2017.  In addition, the Costa Rican government, working closely with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and regional partners, reportedly disrupted more than 20 international drug trafficking rings in Costa Rica during the first 10 months of the year.   Costa Rica is a regional leader in eradicating and seizing marijuana.  During the first nine months of 2018, Costa Rican authorities destroyed 1.25 million plants and seized an additional 4.3 MT of loose marijuana.  Local marijuana is grown primarily for domestic use.  To combat a growing cocaine-for-marijuana/arms trade between Jamaica and Costa Rica, the SNG will deploy more advanced maritime patrol boats in 2019 in the Caribbean.   The government expanded cooperation on maritime interdiction and information exchange with Panama and Colombia in 2018, and initiated contacts with Jamaica.    Seizure totals of illicit drugs other than cocaine and marijuana, including synthetic drugs, remained minimal in 2018.  For example, no heroin was seized in Costa Rica during the first nine months of the year, compared to only seven kilograms during the same period in \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 144  2017.  Organismo de Investigación Judicial (OIJ) and the Costa Rican Drug Institute monitor for signs of synthetic drugs in Costa Rica, which remain rare.  However, capacity building in this area increased in 2018, particularly related to identification of precursor chemicals, as well as understanding the criminal networks and patterns involved in its trafficking.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  The production, trafficking, and sale of illicit drugs remain serious criminal offenses in Costa Rica, even if laws against personal consumption are rarely enforced.  The Costa Rican Drug Institute is the government agency that oversees drug prevention programs, including publicity campaigns and materials for schools.  The Institute on Alcohol and Drug Abuse also offers treatment and prevention programs, though considerable gaps remain.  With the uptick in violence, the MPS is increasingly focused on prevention programs.  The National Police implement the Drug Abuse Resistance and Education (DARE) program and the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program.  GREAT began in August 2013, and has grown from 800 graduates in 2014 to over 15,000 in 2018.   4.  Corruption  The Costa Rican government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  The growing presence of transnational criminal organizations and the harm they inflict on Costa Rican society, including corruption, is a chief concern.  The government generally implements a 2006 law that penalizes official corruption; however, there are frequent reports of low- and mid-level corruption, and periodic cases of high-level corruption.  The Costa Rican government has estimated it loses about seven percent of its GDP annually to corruption.     The judicial branch is in the midst of a two-year effort to strengthen ethics controls within the judiciary.  The United States is actively supporting this and related efforts to stem corruption.     A corruption and influence peddling scandal that broke in July 2017 has triggered investigations and suspensions of officials, and continues to cause political ripples.  The Judiciary has been most severely hit, with the head of the Supreme Court opting for early retirement, and a second justice removed from the court.  Three separate legal proceedings are being pursued by the Attorney General, the banking sector supervisor, and the National Assembly.     C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  Costa Rica shares the U.S. priorities of disrupting the flow of illicit drugs and dismantling organized crime.  The United States supports Costa Rican efforts to investigate and prosecute crimes more effectively, to make its borders more secure, and to increase the safety of its citizens, consistent with the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI).   The United States supports police professionalization through a range of training, police academy reform, and expanded tactical training capacity.  In 2018, the Costa Rican government adopted a U.S.-supported community security program as its national crime reduction plan.  In \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 145  so doing, they significantly expanded an intelligence-based citizen security initiative based on a Colombian model program designed to increase cooperation between law enforcement and local government to enhance citizen security.  The result is a whole-of-government preventative effort, “Sembremos Seguridad,” focused on addressing the drivers of insecurity and criminality, including drug trafficking, in Costa Rica’s most problematic neighborhoods.  Costa Rica plans to expand Sembremos Seguridad to all 82 municipalities.    In the justice sector, the United States supports training programs for investigators, prosecutors, and judges on a broad range of topics, including trafficking in persons, money laundering, and counternarcotics.  The United States supports a highly successful restorative juvenile justice program, the second phase of which was launched in early 2018.     The United States continues to support Costa Rican efforts to further strengthen the SNG and SVA’s interdiction capabilities, providing boats with greater reach, a ground-based radar, equipment, training, and professional exchanges.  These increasingly professional and strategic forces are willing partners with great potential.  In early 2018, the first Costa Rican liaison reported to the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South, marking an important milestone for multilateral cooperation on maritime drug interdiction.   A U.S.-supported Maritime Interdiction Vetted Unit (MIVU) comprised of representatives from a specialized law enforcement unit and the SNG was organizationally revamped in 2016, retooled with improved equipment in 2017, and expanded to two units in 2018.    D.  Conclusion  Costa Rica took another step forward in 2018 in its efforts to strengthen its ability to combat drug trafficking and tackle the rising presence of transnational criminal organizations.  In addition to key investments in human capital and equipment, the government’s enactment of a security tax will provide an annual font of resources dedicated to security.  That said, Costa Rica must maintain its planned security sector growth over the mid-term if it hopes to keep up with the rapid increase in drug flows now permeating its territory, and the associated criminality.     Top priorities for increasing effectiveness and efficiency should continue to include:  1) professionalizing police and judicial institutions, with an emphasis on anti-corruption; 2) augmenting the use of advanced investigative techniques aimed at organized crime; 3) further investment in border security, to include Border and Customs Police, and the continued build-up of the Coast Guard and Air Surveillance Service capabilities to control the country’s sovereign territory; 4) passing laws that specifically target organized crime and its proceeds; and 5) continuing to strengthen Costa Rica’s cooperation with regional partners.  Its successful engagement with Panama and Colombia, for example, already yields results.       \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 146  Cuba  Cuba is not a major consumer, producer, or transit point of illicit drugs.  Cuba’s domestic production and consumption remain low due to active policing, strict sentencing, and nationwide prevention and public information programs.  Cuba’s intensive security presence and interdiction efforts have kept supply down and prevented traffickers from establishing a foothold.  Cuba concentrates supply reduction efforts on preventing smuggling through territorial waters, rapidly collecting abandoned drugs found washed up on coastal shores, and conducting thorough airport searches.  Cuba dedicates significant resources to prevent illicit drugs and their use from spreading, and regional traffickers typically avoid Cuba.  While most maritime seizures are found washed up on the shores of Cuba’s southeastern coast, Cuban authorities have reported an increase in drugs found washed up on shores in the western provinces of Pinar del Rio and Isla Juventud.  The United States and Cuba continue to hold expanded bilateral discussions on law enforcement and drug control cooperation.    With respect to international cooperation, the Cuban government reports 40 bilateral agreements for counterdrug cooperation, including the U.S.-Cuba Operational Cooperation Arrangement to Counter Illicit Traffic in Narcotics and Psychotropic Substances (signed in July 2016).  The U.S. Embassy maintains a U.S. Coast Guard (USCG) liaison to coordinate with Cuban law enforcement, particularly the Cuban Border Guards.  USCG and Cuban authorities share tactical information related to boats transiting Cuban territorial waters suspected of trafficking and coordinate responses between operational command centers.  In addition, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) established direct communications with Cuba’s National Anti-drug Directorate in July 2016.  Since then, DEA has received approximately 20 requests for information related to drug investigations, as well as cooperation leading to Cuba’s successful arrest of a fugitive wanted in the United States.  Cuba has demonstrated a willingness to turn over some U.S. fugitives of high interest.  Cuba and the United States continue to share communication between the national central authorities of both countries, which has greatly enhanced bilateral cooperation within the context of the U.S.-Cuba Law Enforcement Dialogue.  Cuba has provided evidence and information to assist U.S. state and federal prosecutions.  In another first in law enforcement cooperation, on July 7, 2018, the USCG turned over drug samples and a case package on two Jamaican nationals detained by Cuban Border Guard after the USCG collected their jettisoned drugs.  Cuba continues to demonstrate a willingness to cooperate on law enforcement matters.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 147  Dominican Republic  A.  Introduction  The Dominican Republic is the top transshipment hub for cocaine passing through the Caribbean, and the U.S. government estimates approximately 90 percent of the cocaine bound for North America and Europe through the Caribbean transits through the Dominican Republic.  Maritime routes, involving the use of “go-fast” boats and commercial containers, continue to be the primary method of smuggling drugs into and out of the country.  The country is experiencing an increase in drug-related violence, especially as local groups engage in violent turf battles to control domestic drug distribution.  To combat the influence of drug traffickers, the Dominican Republic continued its cooperation with the U.S. government in 2018 to interdict illicit drug shipments and extradite criminals.  The United States works actively with the Dominican Republic to plan and conduct international operations to seize illicit drugs and dismantle criminal organizations; however, corruption continues to hamper these efforts.  The Dominican government conducts outreach efforts to warn youth about the dangers of drugs.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1. Institutional Development  Cooperation remains strong between the Dominican and U.S. governments to combat drug trafficking and related transnational crime.  The U.S. government’s primary partners are the National Directorate for the Control of Drugs (DNCD); the Dominican National Police (DNP); the National Council on Drugs (CND); the Office of the Attorney General; the National Intelligence Directorate (DNI); and the Dominican Armed Forces.  The Dominican Specialized Corps for Port Security, working in conjunction with U.S. authorities and private port operators, continued efforts to improve security at key ports.  The participation of the Dominican government in the Cooperative Situational Information Integration system, the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), and the Central America Integration System enhanced relations with the United States and regional Caribbean partners.  Dominican authorities continued joint efforts with the Haitian National Police to exchange information by establishing liaison officers in their respective headquarters.  The Dominican Republic is a party to the Inter-American Convention against Corruption.  In 1985, the United States and the Dominican Republic signed an agreement on international narcotics control cooperation.  The Dominican Republic signed and ratified the Caribbean Regional Maritime Agreement and has a maritime counterdrug agreement with the United States that entered into force in 1995.  The United States and the Dominican Republic signed an extradition treaty in 2015 that entered into force in December 2016, replacing the 1909 treaty, and provides for extradition on a much broader scope of crimes.  In 2012, the United States and the Dominican Republic entered into a Permanent Forfeited Asset-Sharing Agreement.  Through 2018, approximately $4 million in assets have been shared under this agreement.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 148  The Dominican Republic continues to be one of the most active extradition partners in the world for the United States.  Although there is no formal bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between the Dominican Republic and the United States, requests for legal assistance are made through informal channels and formal means pursuant to multilateral law enforcement cooperation treaties and conventions to which the United States and the Dominican Republic are parties.  The Dominican Republic processes U.S. requests for legal and judicial assistance in a timely manner.  2. Supply Reduction  Illicit drugs are seized throughout the country, but the majority of seizures are made through operations targeting vessels from South America.  During the first eight months of 2018, 3.3 metric tons (MT) of cocaine were seized directly by Dominican forces within the territory of the Dominican Republic.  During the same period, the Dominican government contributed to the seizure of 2.14 MT of cocaine entering and exiting the Dominican Republic by U.S. authorities and other international partners.  Illicit drugs remain available for local consumption and are transshipped to the United States and Europe, primarily through maritime routes.  The DNCD and Dominican military continue to cooperate with the United States and international partners in planning and conducting operations to interdict go-fast vessels attempting to deliver illicit narcotics to the southern coast, as well as to interdict drugs exiting the Dominican Republic.  One Dominican port, Caucedo, is certified under the Container Security Initiative (CSI), a U.S. initiative to help increase security for maritime containerized cargo shipped to the United States.  However, the other 15 Dominican ports, including Rio Haina, the other major Dominican port handling container traffic destined for the United States, are not CSI certified.  The DNCD is increasing efforts to combat contraband at the ports.  3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Local drug use is concentrated in tourist centers and major metropolitan areas, although drug use and associated violence occurs throughout the country.  The CND conducted demand reduction efforts in 2018 to warn Dominican youth of the negative effects of illicit drug use under the Strategic National University Plan on the Prevention and Use of Drugs.  The DNP promoted community-based policing as an effective way to deal with crime locally.  With the publication of its Community Policing manual, the DNP began outreach at the command level to implement community policing concepts more fully in the capital and other major population centers around the country.  4. Corruption  As a matter of policy, the Dominican government does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  However, corruption remains endemic.  The Government of the Dominican Republic has taken some steps to address corruption among military and law enforcement forces, but corruption remains a significant impediment to law enforcement efforts in the country and prosecution of \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 149  corrupt high-level officials is not the norm.  The judiciary is politicized and riddled with corruption, and the legal system offers little recourse to those who lack money or influence.   A popular movement called the Green Movement that developed in response to the increased perception of corruption in the government, continued to protest impunity and pressure for greater transparency in 2018.  The perceived inaction against those that received $92 million in bribes from Brazilian company Odebrecht spurred the continuation of popular unrest against the government.  The Attorney General initially brought charges against 14 individuals, but eventually only presented charges against seven, including a previously sitting minister.  The judicial case began in late 2018 and will be heard before the Supreme Court.  While several judges were suspended in 2018 due to alleged links to narcotic traffickers and other officials in the executive and judiciary have been suspended from their functions due to anti-corruption investigations, there have been no convictions in these cases to date.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through CBSI.  With CBSI funds, the United States government implements programs designed to enhance existing Dominican law enforcement capabilities by improving technical and professional abilities to conduct investigations, to enable effective prosecution, and to coordinate and participate in drug control efforts with the United States and neighboring countries’ law enforcement agencies.  The U.S. law enforcement community has strong relationships with its Dominican colleagues, as evidenced by the high number of extraditions and deportations of fugitives to the United States.  The United States provided equipment and training in 2018 to increase the capabilities of Dominican law enforcement entities, including support for the DNCD drug-detection canine units, and other specialized DNCD investigative and reactive units.  The United States enhanced DNCD’s computer training, database expansion, and systems maintenance support.  Dominican authorities work with neighboring countries to expand the use of a U.S.-supported canine facility as a regional training center.  The United States continues efforts to strengthen maritime capabilities through training in maritime law enforcement, search and rescue, port security, crisis management, and professional development for the Dominican Navy’s officer and enlisted corps.  The United States provides tactical training, equipment, and other assistance to both the DNCD and Dominican military involved in illicit trafficking interdiction.  The United States assists the DNP with its transformation into a professional, civilian-oriented organization by providing training at the entry and officer levels as well as technical assistance to strengthen strategic planning and communication, operations management and human resource systems.  The Dominican legislature ratified a Police Organic Law in 2016 that has the potential to bring about significant institutional improvements to the DNP if fully implemented.  The Dominican Republic continues to work towards passing legislative proposals related to illicit enrichment and anti-corruption by public officials.  Efforts to strengthen the infrastructure of the Financial Analysis Unit remain ongoing.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 150  The United States supports the Dominican Republic's efforts to establish a transparent and effective justice sector.  U.S. assistance promotes justice sector reforms by strengthening Dominican government capacity to manage and prosecute complex money laundering, fraud, public corruption, and illicit trafficking cases, as well as to establish internal controls to prevent corruption.  The United States works with the Offices of the Attorney General, Prosecutorial Training School, Judiciary, Public Ministry, Public Defense, Supreme Court of Justice, and Constitutional Tribunal.  These CBSI programs strengthen justice sector career, integrity, and accountability systems, and contribute to building the capacity of the national police and prosecutors to develop stronger cases and coordinate efforts leading to more successful prosecutions.  As part of CBSI, U.S. assistance strengthens Dominican civil society coalitions for citizen security and criminal justice reform, supports community justice houses that increase access to justice for vulnerable populations, and provides technical assistance for the implementation of the new organic law on police reform.  CBSI funds crime prevention programs that help at-risk youth pursue education, vocational training, and employment.  These programs support broader drug control efforts by enhancing life skills, facilitating positive interaction with police and improving communities’ trust in and willingness to work with police, thereby making communities more resilient to crime including crime with a nexus to drug trafficking, distribution, and drug use.    The Dominican Republic regularly participates in two recurring events to promote cooperation against maritime trafficking; the Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit and the Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summit.  These two events bring together counterdrug professionals from over 30 countries and over 80 international organizations spanning North, Central, and South America, and Europe.  D.  Conclusion  Combating pervasive corruption, restoring public confidence in law enforcement, addressing illicit maritime drug smuggling, and confronting rising levels of drug-fueled violence are major challenges facing the Dominican Republic.  The Dominican Republic’s aerial and maritime interdiction efforts demonstrate institutional capacity and political will to help stem the flow of drugs into the country.  The Dominican government must continue to improve its efforts to build a coherent, multifaceted drug control program.  Key to this effort will be increased domestic cooperation between the DNP, DNCD, and military units, combined with greater cooperation with law enforcement agencies in other countries in the region.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 151  Dutch Caribbean  A.  Introduction  The Dutch Caribbean consists of Aruba, Curaçao, Sint Maarten, Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba.  Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten are autonomous countries within the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  Bonaire, St. Eustatius and Saba are special municipalities of the country of the Netherlands.  Aruba and Curaçao are located 30 to 40 miles north of Venezuela and continue to serve as northbound transshipment points for cocaine originating from Colombia and transiting Venezuela.  Cocaine is primarily transported via fishing boats and inter-coastal freighters for transshipment to the United States, other Caribbean islands, Africa, and Europe.  Sint Maarten is located in the Eastern Caribbean and is a transshipment hub for cocaine, heroin, and marijuana ultimately destined for Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands as well as Europe.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  Aruba, Curaçao, and Sint Maarten have a high degree of autonomy over their internal affairs, with the right to exercise independent decision-making in a number of drug control areas.  The Kingdom of the Netherlands is responsible for the islands’ defense and foreign affairs, and assists the governments in their efforts to combat drug trafficking through its support for the RST (Dutch acronym for “Special Police Task Force”).    In 2016, the United States, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Aruba, Sint Maarten, and Curaçao signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) to enhance existing cooperation and strengthen law enforcement and criminal justice systems in the Caribbean parts of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.  No new counterdrug programs were initiated in 2018.   Aruba  Aruba’s police force, the Korps Politie Aruba (KPA), continues to evolve into a regional leader in the fight against narcotics trafficking and international criminal organizations.  The KPA is at the forefront in collecting and sharing intelligence with regional law enforcement partners.  Despite insufficient resources, the KPA continues to investigate trafficking organizations effectively.  The Organized Crime Unit of the KPA conducted several successful investigations during fiscal year 2018, which led to the seizure of over 380 kilograms (kg) of cocaine; 75 kg of marijuana; one kg of heroin; $2,100,000 in illicit drug proceeds; and the arrest of multiple subjects.     Curaçao  Curaçao’s police force, the Korps Politie Curaçao (KPC), works closely with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) to diminish the flow of illegal drugs transiting from \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 152  Venezuela and Colombia to the Dutch Caribbean.  In June 2018, the KPC seized approximately 102 kg of cocaine, eight kg of heroin, and 11 firearms in a single incident.  During the first 10 months of 2018, the KPC seized approximately 1.6 metric tons (MT) of cocaine and eight kg of heroin.  KPC continues to investigate trafficking organizations effectively, but institutional weaknesses remain.  St. Maarten  St. Maarten/St. Martin is a transshipment point for cocaine in the Caribbean to the United States, partially due to its proximity to the U.S. Virgin Islands (approximately 100 nautical miles away) and Puerto Rico (approximately 200 nautical miles away), as well as to Europe.  This small two-nation island is a challenging place for law enforcement to combat drug trafficking due to its separate legal jurisdictions between the Kingdom of the Netherlands (St. Maarten) and France (St. Martin).   In 2015, authorities in St. Maarten lifted the visa requirement for Colombian and Venezuelan nationals to travel to St. Maarten.  Colombian and Venezuelan drug trafficking organizations operating in St. Maarten/St. Martin mostly utilize Dominican nationals to transport large cocaine shipments, via “go-fast” vessel to the United States.  Many of the go-fast vessels are stored at unlicensed marinas located on the French side of St. Martin.    According to DEA, multi-ton quantities of cocaine are smuggled into Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands via go-fast vessels from St. Maarten/St. Martin on a monthly basis.  In 2018, U.S. authorities worked effectively with Dutch, French, and Dutch Caribbean authorities to target maritime vessels trafficking large quantities of cocaine from St. Maarten/St. Martin to Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  These operations resulted in the seizure of approximately 1.67 MT of cocaine and $143,000 in drug proceeds.  Bonaire, St. Eustatius, Saba  The National Office for the Caribbean in the Netherlands Ministry of Interior Affairs and Kingdom Relations assumes the responsibilities of law enforcement, security, and other administrative functions on behalf of the Government of the Netherlands for Bonaire, St. Eustatius, and Saba.  2. Supply Reduction  Due to increased intelligence sharing and cooperation between Dutch Caribbean law enforcement organizations and U.S. authorities, the opportunity to further disrupt drug trafficking is improving.  In addition, the aforementioned MOU promotes enhanced police enforcement and better organization for airport security and harbor/cruise terminal security with the goal of reducing drug trafficking.  According to DEA, in 2018, Dutch Caribbean authorities working with U.S. law enforcement support seized approximately 3.64 MT of cocaine; 454 kg of marijuana; nine kg of heroin; conducted 112 drug related arrests; and seized approximately $2,243,000 in assets from drug traffickers.  These statistics do not include seizures by the Dutch Navy.    3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 153   Drug treatment and prevention is accomplished through a combination of privately and publicly funded foundations on each of the islands.  Sint Maarten has one drug treatment foundation that suffered severe damage from Hurricane Irma in 2017 and has yet to fully recover.  4. Corruption  None of the Dutch Caribbean countries, as a matter of government policy, encourages or facilitates illegal activity associated with drug trafficking; however, in October 2018 approximately 500 kg of seized cocaine were stolen from the KPC’s evidence vault in Curaçao.  There is an ongoing investigation, but the evidence obtained at this juncture points to internal corruption in the local police force as the catalyst of the theft.    C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The objectives of U.S. drug control policy in the Dutch Caribbean are to promote cooperation between law enforcement and military partners, and to reduce illicit drug trafficking.  DEA works with its island counterparts to advance joint investigations, both within the Dutch Caribbean and the United States.  The Kingdom of the Netherlands supports drug control efforts by continuing to support U.S. Air Force Forward Operating Locations in Curaçao and Aruba.  U.S. military aircraft conduct detection and monitoring flights over the southern Caribbean Sea.  In addition, the Dutch Navy regularly conducts drug interdiction operations in the region as the lead for Task Group 4.4 under the auspices of Joint Interagency Task Force South.  With support from the U.S. Coast Guard, the Royal Netherlands Navy interdicted approximately 5.1 MT of cocaine during the first 10 months of 2018 (not including Dutch Caribbean Coast Guard seizures).    D.  Conclusion  Eight years after the dissolution of the Netherlands Antilles, Curaçao and Sint Maarten are still establishing counterdrug organizational structures among their various agencies.  It is imperative that both islands embrace regional cooperation and intelligence sharing efforts.  Both Curaçao and Sint Maarten can look to Aruba as an example of how this is accomplished.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 154  Eastern Caribbean   A.  Introduction  The Eastern Caribbean (EC) refers to the independent countries of Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Saint Kitts and Nevis, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines collectively in this report.      The EC is a transshipment point for cocaine and marijuana destined for North America, Europe, and the Caribbean.  There is cannabis cultivation in all EC countries, mostly for local consumption, and the amount grown varies from country to country.  There is a low local demand for cocaine, and negligible use of synthetic drugs.    The geographic and jurisdictional diversity of the EC represent major challenges to combatting the illegal drug trade.  These countries do not have sufficient maritime resources to effectively patrol their entire coastlines.  Although traffickers use a variety of vessels like yachts and cargo ships to transport illicit drugs, “go-fast” boats are still popular, which enable traffickers to avoid capture by accessing multiple territorial waters.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends     1.  Institutional Development  All EC countries have strong working relationships with the United States on drug control operations.  Grenada’s National Anti-Drug Strategy (2014-2018) was near completion at the end of 2018, and covers legislation, interdiction, education, and public awareness.  With the assistance of the Organization of American States, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is in the process of establishing a new National Drug Council and creating a national drug policy.  Saint Kitts and Nevis has increased the size of its police force and opened a new forensics laboratory.  Saint Lucia appointed a new drug squad commander in October 2018.  Antigua and Barbuda passed the 2018 Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Act that exempts from criminal liability “a person who is in possession of a maximum of 15 grams of the drug Cannabis or Cannabis resin,”  although smoking in public and selling it remains illegal.  Children under the age of 18 are required to participate in drug counseling if caught with cannabis or cannabis resin.  Barbados and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines are planning to allow cultivation, domestic use, and export of medicinal marijuana under licensing controls to countries where medicinal cannabis is legal.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines is also considering legalization of cannabis for religious purposes.  All of these countries have extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties in force with the United States.  All have signed or ratified the Inter-American Convention against Corruption and the Inter-American Convention against Terrorism.  Antigua and Barbuda and Saint Lucia ratified the Inter-American Convention on Extradition.  Antigua and Barbuda, Dominica, and Grenada have signed and/or ratified the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 155   2.  Supply Reduction  During the first nine months of 2018, drug seizures in the EC totaled 661 kilograms of cocaine and nine metric tons of marijuana, according to data received from each country.  Saint Kitts and Nevis reported eradicating 45 hectares (ha) of cannabis, while Saint Lucia (10.5 ha), Saint Vincent and the Grenadines (eight ha), Dominica (1.2 ha), Antigua (.8 ha), and Grenada (.1 ha) reported eradicating smaller amounts of cultivation.  During the same period, Antigua and Barbuda reported 142 drug-related arrests with 70 prosecutions and 66 convictions.  Barbados reported 105 drug-related arrests with 105 prosecutions.  Dominica reported 49 drug-related arrests, 45 prosecutions, and 18 convictions.  Grenada reported 240 drug-related arrests, 401 prosecutions, and 275 convictions.  Saint Kitts and Nevis reported 205 drug-related arrests, 205 prosecutions, and 97 convictions.  Saint Lucia reported 146 drug-related arrests.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines reported 213 drug-related arrests, 186 prosecutions, and 182 convictions.    Some countries report a growing market for strains of marijuana from the United States and Canada.  Some countries also report an increase in the use of commercial cargo airlines and different types of marine vessels for transshipment.  Barbados reported more small-scale trafficking in 2018.  The United States has provided assistance to all of the countries in the form of training and equipment.  This assistance has built better relationships for operational law enforcement purposes.          3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Reliable statistics on consumption and use are not available, but the most commonly used drug is marijuana.  All of the countries have some form of drug demand reduction programming.  Barbados, Grenada, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines have implemented the U.S. Drug Abuse Resistance Education (DARE) program for youth.  Barbados also has programs through the National Council on Substance Abuse, the Centre for Counseling Addiction Support Alternative, and Alcoholics Anonymous.  The National Council on Substance Abuse monitors the programs through qualitative assessments, surveys, and pre- and post-tests.  The National Drug Avoidance Committee in the Ministry of Education operates Grenada’s programs.    Notably, Saint Kitts and Nevis has four formal programs.  The Explorer program targets children in the 5-12 year age range.  Mentoring Advising Guiding Instructing Children (MAGIC) teaches children about the harmful effects of drugs.  Teen and Police Service (TAPS) targets predominantly at-risk or troubled teens.  Operation Future brings children and parents together to learn about the perils of drug use.    Saint Lucia’s Substance Abuse Advisory Council Secretariat develops policies and programs tailored to individuals, communities, and the entire country.  Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has numerous programs, including police youth clubs and summer programs and a local cadet force.  The Pan Against Crime Initiative celebrated its 10th anniversary in 2018, and teaches young people to play steel drums.  For adults, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has a Monday night radio program that allows police to reach a large audience with anti-drug messaging.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 156   Not every country has drug rehabilitation clinics.  Antigua and Barbuda has two private rehabilitation centers.  Barbados has five drug rehabilitation clinics, while Saint Lucia and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines has one each.      4.  Corruption   As a matter of policy, the region’s governments do not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of narcotic or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  In 2018, there were no arrests of senior government officials for drug-related activity.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence affecting EC citizens, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  CBSI programming in the Eastern Caribbean strengthens the capacity of law enforcement institutions to detect, interdict, prosecute, convict, and incarcerate criminals.  The programs support information sharing networks, joint interagency operations, and regional training initiatives to promote interoperability.  The United States maintains bilateral agreements to suppress illicit traffic by sea with Antigua and Barbuda, Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, St. Kitts and Nevis, St. Lucia, and St. Vincent and the Grenadines, which include provisions regarding ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry into territorial waters, overflight, and order to land.   In addition to the bilateral agreements the United States has with each country, the United States signed an agreement with the Regional Security System (RSS).  The main drug control goals of that agreement include supporting operations of the RSS Air Wing and the RSS Digital Forensic Lab and collaborating on training for all member states.    D.  Conclusion   The United States enjoys strong operational cooperation with EC countries on drug control matters.  Through these relations, these countries prosecuted at least 10 major traffickers in 2018.  The United States strongly recommends that all countries meet their financial commitments to the RSS and, for those in arrears, pay their back dues.  The United States also recommends that standard operating procedures for communication and coordination domestically and internationally between and among EC countries be further developed and implemented, where those procedures do not already exist.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 157  Ecuador  A.  Introduction   Situated between two of the world’s largest cocaine producing countries, Ecuador is a major transit country for illicit drugs.  Cocaine and heroin from Colombia and cocaine from Peru is trafficked through porous land borders and via maritime routes for distribution to the United States and Europe.  While not a major drug producing country, Ecuador is a major transit country for chemical precursors to process illicit drugs and is vulnerable to transnational organized crime due to permeable borders and corruption.  While committed to combating drug trafficking, Ecuador’s police, military, and judiciary lack sufficient resources to confront transnational criminal challenges.   The government of President Lenin Moreno, who took office in May 2017, remains committed to reducing both drug supply and drug demand, as reflected in a new 2017-2021 National Drug Prevention and Control Plan.  Domestic drug consumption is rising and public treatment facilities are insufficient to treat the country’s population suffering from substance use disorders.    In the first quarter of 2018, the drug trafficking group Oliver Sinisterra Front, led by a former Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) guerrilla member, carried out attacks, kidnappings, and killings of journalists, military personnel, and private citizens along Ecuador’s northern border with Colombia.  To respond to this threat, the Ecuadorian government has increased security forces at the border, strengthened cooperation with Colombia, and issued a new Northern Border Security, Peace, and Development Plan.  The Moreno government has also made positive steps to expand cooperation with the United States and other international partners to fight transnational crime and drugs.     B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development   The Ecuadorian government is concerned about the detrimental effects of drug trafficking and transnational organized crime throughout the country.  During the first 10 months of 2018, 10,144 individuals were arrested for trafficking-related crimes, compared to 9,054 during the same period in 2017, an increase of 12 percent.  In April 2018, as part of a government-wide downsizing initiative, President Moreno eliminated the Technical Secretariat of Drugs (SETED) that was previously responsible for coordinating the overall drug control policy in Ecuador.  The Ministry of Health assumed coordination and oversight of drug prevention, demand reduction, and treatment programs.  The Ministry of Interior is now responsible for combating the production, trafficking, sale, and use of illicit drugs, as well as regulating the use of controlled substances and destroying seized substances.  The now defunct SETED destroyed 35 metric tons (MT) of seized illegal substances during the first six months of 2018.  The Ministry of Interior reported it destroyed 16 MT of seized illegal substances between July and October.  In early October, Ecuadorian media reported that 26.4 MT of seized drugs were being stored in five warehouses nationwide, waiting to be incinerated.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 158  Ecuador’s 2008 constitution categorizes drug abuse as a public health problem and mandates that the government develop prevention programs and provide treatment and rehabilitation options to persons with substance use disorders.  A criminal code (COIP) that went into effect in 2014 increased penalties for most crimes, while decriminalizing personal use, possession, and consumption of relatively small amounts of narcotics.  The COIP created a tiered approach to drug trafficking and possession, with larger amounts carrying longer prison sentences.    In September 2015, the National Assembly approved amendments to the 2014 COIP that created a table of drug quantities and penalties, drastically reducing the minimum amount of narcotics required to trigger each tier of punishment.  In 2016, Ecuador established two special crime laboratories in Quito and Guayaquil.   The Government of Ecuador has bilateral drug control agreements with many countries in the region, including the United States.  The United States and Ecuador have agreements on measures to prevent the diversion of precursor chemicals, the sharing of information for currency transactions over $10,000, and a customs mutual assistance agreement.  In April 2018, the Ministry of Interior signed a MOU with DHS to establish a Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit, and a framework agreement MOU with U.S. Immigration and Custom Enforcement and the DEA to facilitate drug control and border security cooperation and information sharing.   In June 2018, the Ecuadorian Ministry of Defense and U.S. Department of Defense signed a memorandum of agreement to place an Ecuadorian liaison officer at the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force-South (JIATF-S) in Florida.  In September 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Patrol, under the authority of JIATF-S, initiated regular maritime patrol flights in coordination with the Ecuadorian Ministries of Defense and Interior and with the participation of Ecuadorian military and police riders, to monitor and interdict maritime drug trafficking in the Eastern Pacific.  The U.S. Coast Guard and Ecuadorian maritime authorities also exercise Maritime Operational Procedures that coordinate the boarding of vessels claiming Ecuadorian nationality and stateless vessels in international waters.  In October 2018, the Minister of Interior, the Attorney General, and DEA signed an MOU regarding information exchange.  DEA continues to support a vetted unit within the National Police Antinarcotics Division.  The United States and Ecuador are parties to an 1873 extradition treaty and a supplementary treaty that entered into force in 1941.  However, Ecuador’s constitution prohibits the extradition of Ecuadorian citizens.  The United States has worked with the Moreno administration to improve administrative processes related to extradition requests.  The United States and Ecuador do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty, but cooperate under the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, as well as relevant UN conventions.      2.  Supply Reduction   Ecuador remains a major transit country for cocaine shipments via air, land, and maritime routes, and heroin shipments via air and mail.  Drug traffickers use various methods to move shipments, including containerized cargo ships, small fishing boats, self-propelled semi-submersible and fully-submersible submarines, “go-fast” boats, aircraft, human couriers, and mail.  Ecuadorian maritime trafficking networks consistently use routes south of the Galapagos Islands to \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 159  destinations in Central America to circumvent law enforcement interdiction efforts.  Transnational criminal organizations, many based in Mexico and Colombia, continue to operate in Ecuador.   Official police statistics indicate that during the first 10 months of 2018, cocaine seizures totaled 54 MT, equal to the 54 MT of cocaine seized during the same period in 2017.  The volume of heroin seized during this same 10-month period totaled 198 kilograms (kg), a decline from 2017, when 305 kg were seized during the same period.  Twelve MT of marijuana were seized during the first 10 months of 2018, compared with 10 MT during the first 10 months in 2017.  In the month of August 2018 alone, several Ecuadorian National Police (ENP) units in conjunction with DEA carried out a series of highly effective operations that resulted in the seizure of 4.7 MT of cocaine hydrochloride, 14 MT of calcium chloride, 9.45 kg of heroin, and 21 arrests.   Maritime seizures of all illicit drugs totaled 5.8 MT during the first 10 months of 2018, compared to approximately 6.8 MT in all of 2017.  This included three MT of cocaine seized in international waters close to the Galapagos Islands as a result of the first deployment of a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) P-3 maritime patrol aircraft to Ecuador in September 2018.   Drug traffickers use containerized cargo and shipping containers to smuggle drugs out of Ecuador, often concealing drugs in licit cargo.  The Port of Guayaquil is a major transshipment hub for cocaine concealed in containerized cargo to Europe.  The port authority, Contecon, employs security measures at its facility but inspects only 7 percent of containerized exports.  During the first 10 months of 2018, the port authority inspected 38,745 containers.  In July 2018, the United States and Ecuador signed a Declaration of Principles incorporating Ecuador into the Container Security Initiative, which permits CBP personnel to be posted at the Port of Guayaquil to work with Ecuadorian authorities to strengthen the port security and facilitate trade.    The last survey on coca cultivation in 2014 by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) showed no significant coca cultivation in Ecuador.  In 2018, Ecuadorian authorities detected small-scale coca cultivation along the northern border.  The government’s policy is for the police or military to eradicate immediately coca, poppy, or cannabis when discovered, although nearly all poppy plants are wild and not cultivated for heroin production.  Largely due to the refocusing of security efforts in response to violence on the northern border in early 2018, the government decreased eradication of coca plants from 10,100 to 3,798 and did not eradicate any poppy plants, compared to the 145,074 poppy plants eradicated during the first 10 months of 2017.      Synthetic drug production and consumption is an issue of growing concern for Ecuadorian authorities, and the government has made arrests of organized groups involved in trafficking synthetic drugs.  Ecuador has reported to UNODC the emergence of new psychoactive substances.  3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 160  Domestic drug abuse is a growing challenge in Ecuador.  UNODC carries out demand reduction and drug prevention programs in Ecuador with funding from the United States, European Union, and other international donors.  In May 2018, UNODC held a U.S.-funded policymakers workshop for 70 National Assembly members and their advisors on the nature, prevention, and treatment of drug use disorders.  According to UNODC data, 12.7 percent of university students used some type of illicit drug in 2016.  All drug offenders are entitled to drug treatment under the Ecuadorian constitution, but there is a lack of adequate resources and facilities to treat those with addictions.  As of October 2018, there were 45 publicly funded outpatient drug treatment facilities and 12 public inpatient drug treatment facilities in Ecuador.  Other drug treatment options, such as the 198 private facilities that provide drug treatment alternatives, are often prohibitively costly.   In January 2018, the Ecuadorian government launched the “2017-2021 National Plan for Comprehensive Prevention and Control of the Socio-Economic Phenomenon of Drugs.”  In 2018, the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Interior, and ENP conducted drug abuse public awareness campaigns targeted at teachers, religious leaders, children, and youth, among others.  The Government of Ecuador also launched in January 2018 a public awareness television campaign called “Por Un Mar Sin Drogas” (“For a Sea without Drugs”) to highlight the dangers of drug abuse and deter fishermen from engaging in drug trafficking.      4.  Corruption   President Moreno has made anticorruption a priority of his administration.  A number of prosecutions in 2017-2018 have led to the conviction of government officials involved in corruption cases, including a six-year prison sentence for former Vice President Jorge Glas for illicit association in connection with the Brazilian company Odebrecht’s corruption scandal.   As a matter of policy, the Ecuadorian government does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of narcotic or other controlled substances, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  In February 2018, a national referendum approved a lifelong ban from public office of government officials convicted of corruption.  The National Assembly is also considering proposals for a new law to recover illicit proceeds from corruption.   Drug-related corruption remains a problem within the public security forces.  On September 12, two members of the Ecuadorian Air Force were arrested for carrying one metric ton of cocaine in the Ecuadorian military base in Manta.  In October, Ecuadorian authorities arrested and said they intended to prosecute seven military officials and six civilians for altering the Armed Forces’ inventory system and trafficking ammunition to the drug trafficking group Oliver Sinisterra Front.      Ecuador has looked to increase international cooperation on anticorruption.  The Ministry of Foreign Affairs entered into a Memorandum of Understanding on Anti-Corruption with UNODC in 2017 to exchange international best practices on transparency, education, and prevention.  In July 2018, Ecuador joined the Open Government Partnership, an international civil society initiative that promotes government transparency.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 161    The Moreno administration has expressed a strong commitment to work with international partners, including the United States, to fight transnational crime and drug trafficking and strengthen security, particularly in its northern border area.  Between January and April 2018, the Oliver Sinisterra Front conducted a series of bombings and attacks against the military and police in Esmeraldas province that resulted in the death of four military officers and culminated in the kidnapping and murder of three journalists and two private citizens.  The Government of Ecuador augmented its security presence along the northern border with Colombia to over 12,000 military and police personnel.  The Moreno administration also increased its communication and coordination with Colombian authorities.  At Ecuador’s request, the U.S. government provided assistance and training in post-blast investigations.  In September 2018, the Government of Ecuador launched a Northern Border Security, Peace and Development Plan to provide a comprehensive approach to respond to insecurity on the northern border, and has proposed new laws to strengthen public security and strategic intelligence.    The U.S. and Ecuadorian governments reestablished in 2018 a framework for growing bilateral security and drug control cooperation.  During a June 2018 visit to Ecuador, U.S. Vice President Mike Pence announced the United States would provide $3.45 million in new bilateral funding for capacity-building and technical assistance programs to strengthen Ecuador’s criminal justice and law enforcement capabilities.  Additionally, per the request of the Ecuadorian government, the United States reestablished its Office of Security Cooperation at Embassy Quito in August 2018, which the previous Ecuadorian government had closed in 2014.    In 2018, the United States supported Ecuador’s drug prevention efforts in coordination with Ministry of Interior, National Assembly, SETED and other governmental and multilateral entities.  In June 2018, the Community Anti-Drug Coalition of America organization began conducting U.S.-funded trainings and workshops in Duran to develop anti-drug use community coalitions.     Throughout 2018, the United States provided ongoing logistical and operational support for Ecuadorian counterdrug operations.  As a result of regional cooperation among DEA, the Ecuadorian police, and Colombian law enforcement, Edison Prado Alava, a U.S. Government Consolidated Priority Organization Target, was extradited to the United States in February 2018 and pleaded guilty to charges in a Southern Florida court.  Pursuant to the April 2018 agreement, the Ecuadorian National Police established a new Transnational Crime Investigative Unit that received U.S. training.  The United States continues to work with Ecuadorian police and security officials to increase their interdiction capacity at sea and in port facilities, including through the P-3 program and Container Security Initiative.    Since 2006, the United States has maintained an operational arrangement with Ecuador to stop, board, and search Ecuadorian vessels reasonably suspected of drug smuggling encountered at sea.  Ecuador is a founding member of the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counterdrug Summit, which brings together maritime counterdrug professionals from approximately 25 countries and over 60 international agencies spanning North, South and Central America, and Europe.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 162  D.  Conclusion   The United States supports Ecuador’s drug control efforts and strongly encourages Ecuador to take further steps to interdict illicit drugs and control of chemical precursors, both on land and at sea.  To address the growing challenges of drug trafficking, the Ecuadorian government will need to continue working with international partners and devote additional resources to augment the capacity of the police and military through improved communications, equipment, and technology to facilitate investigations, and provision of additional training for the police and the military.  The Ecuadorian government should also focus on securing containerized, maritime cargo from illicit use and increasing maritime interdiction capacity.        \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 163  El Salvador   A.  Introduction   El Salvador remains a transit country for illicit drugs originating from source countries in South America destined for the United States.  In 2018, El Salvador maintained an active maritime presence though interdiction operations by the Salvadoran Navy and information-sharing with international partners that served to push most maritime traffic beyond the 200 nautical mile mark El Salvador claims as its territorial waters.  Analysis of drug trafficking trends suggests drug trafficking organizations are trafficking cocaine shipments by maritime conveyance farther offshore into the Pacific Ocean, beyond the operational capacity of the Salvadoran Navy, to avoid detection.  Transnational cocaine-trafficking organizations use private vehicles to transport small amounts of cocaine to the Guatemalan border along the Pan-American Highway.    The Salvadoran government continues to implement Plan El Salvador Seguro (PESS), a geographically targeted approach to reducing crime in the most violent municipalities that includes support for drug prevention components.  The Salvadoran government also continued a series of emergency measures launched in 2016 aimed at securing the nation’s prisons and dismantling gang leadership structures that play a role in local drug distribution, and transitioned the majority of the measures into the penal code.  A lack of reliable information on the severity of drug consumption and internal distribution within El Salvador continues to present a challenge.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends             1.  Institutional Development   The Anti-Narcotics Division (DAN) of the National Civil Police (PNC) is the primary agency responsible for combating drug-related crimes throughout El Salvador.  The vetted Special Anti-Narcotics Group (GEAN) within the DAN is responsible for conducting sensitive drug investigations.  In 2018, the GEAN continued to build institutional links with more advanced Sensitive Investigation Units (SIUs) in Guatemala and Colombia, greatly expanding El Salvador’s ability to respond to drug trafficking alerts and to investigate larger criminal organizations.  El Salvador supports a full-time liaison officer within the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South (JIATF-S) to support regional drug control coordination.  El Salvador’s National Electronic Monitoring Center began operations in June 2012 with support from the United States.  The center allows Salvadoran law enforcement authorities with judicial warrants to intercept electronic communications to support drug trafficking investigations, increasing operational coordination between the DAN, GEAN, other Salvadoran investigative authorities, and international partners.  This improved intelligence sharing proved pivotal in the August conviction of 61 leaders and members of the transnational criminal gang Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) on more than 150 criminal charges including drug trafficking.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 164  A sustained decline in maritime drug trafficking within Salvadoran territorial waters led to decreased littoral interdiction operations by the Joint Interagency Task Force “Grupo Conjunto Cuscatlán” (GCC).  The unit, equipped for patrols along coastal waterways, encountered little drug trafficking in 2018, and thus continued its focus on operations supporting the arrest of gang members operating from remote estuarine and coastal safe havens.  The Salvadoran Navy maintains primary responsibility for maritime interdiction at or beyond 200 nautical miles from El Salvador’s coastline.  The average interdiction occurs between 400-500 nautical miles offshore, and suspects are detained and escorted ashore for processing by the Salvadoran justice system.  The GCC maintains its primary headquarters away from military facilities and with a primary emphasis on anti-gang efforts, but remains equipped to coordinate with the Navy on littoral interdiction if maritime trafficking trends shift back to where they were in previous years.  The deterioration of the GCC’s relationship with the Salvadoran Navy limited the GCC’s ability to regularly support naval interdictions.  In August 2018, El Salvador’s Attorney General and the Director of the PNC announced the arrests of over 350 MS-13 gang members and the seizure of 100 vehicles, property, and businesses during a complex yearlong investigation.  The arresting agents secured warrants of known gang members, affiliates, and co-conspirators on charges including homicide, drug trafficking, money laundering, and terrorism.  As a result of United States assistance and training, the coordinated takedown represented a significant increase of the Government of El Salvador’s capability to debilitate MS-13 operations through large-scale arrest operations with asset forfeitures.  El Salvador is party to the Central American Convention for the Prevention of Money Laundering Related to Drug-Trafficking and Similar Crimes, the Inter-American Convention Against Corruption, the Inter-American Convention on Extradition, and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.            2.  Supply Reduction   Between January 1 and November 20, Salvadoran authorities seized approximately 12.45 metric tons (MT) of cocaine, 877 kilograms (kg) of marijuana, and 3.39 kg of “crack” cocaine.  Cocaine seizures in 2018 increased 120 percent compared to the same period in 2017, due to the GEAN and Salvadoran Navy’s increased cooperation and intelligence-driven operations with U.S. maritime authorities.  In November, the Salvadoran Navy conducted an operation based on information provided by international partners that resulted in the seizure of 6.38 MT of cocaine 250 nautical miles off the coast of El Salvador, representing the largest seizure in Salvadoran history.  El Salvador continued to divert human and material resources from the DAN to support anti-gang operations in 2018, though the impact on seizures was limited.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Salvadoran authorities seized $550,314 in bulk currency – a 31 percent decrease compared to the same period in 2017 – and arrested 2,949 individuals on drug-related crimes.            3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   Drug use among Salvadorans is a growing concern, particularly among youth.  The government has not kept reliable statistics for illegal consumption since 2012.  The PNC has been \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 165  successfully implementing the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) program in public schools throughout Model Police Precinct (MPP) locations, which combine training and police-community relation activities.  In 2018, the United States trained and certified 80 Salvadoran PNC officers as full-time GREAT instructors, raising the total trained since the program began in 2010 to 470.  In 2018, these officers delivered GREAT to over 25,000 at-risk youth throughout the country.  In addition to the GREAT program, the PNC established Police Athletic Leagues (PAL), benefitting over 18,800 at-risk youth.    As of October, the United States’ partnership with the PNC continued to support citizen security and prevention activities in 50 municipal districts through the MPP Program, with four additional communities scheduled to reach MPP status by the end of 2018.  The MPP, GREAT, and PAL programs now cover all 19 delegations across El Salvador, and were nationalized into the Government of El Salvador’s National Prevention Strategy.  These programs support broader drug control goals by facilitating positive interaction between youth and police and improving communities’ trust in and willingness to work with police, thereby making communities more resilient to crime including crime with a nexus to drug trafficking and use.    In 2018, the Government of El Salvador launched its School Resource Officer Program charged with the protection and education of students while promoting safety and respect for law enforcement.  The United States provides training to support this initiative, and certified 60 officers in the program during 2018.             4.  Corruption   The Government of El Salvador does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  However, corruption within the Salvadoran political system remains a serious problem.  The United States continues to utilize U.S.-trained Colombian polygraphists via the trilateral U.S.-Colombia Action Plan to assist El Salvador’s security forces with anticorruption efforts.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Colombian polygraphists completed 630 exams of PNC investigative units, DAN, GCC, Attorney General staff, and U.S.-supported task forces, with plans to complete an additional 250 exams by the end of 2018.  In September, Attorney General Douglas Melendez successfully won a conviction against former President Antonio Saca on corruption and money laundering charges, which marks the first former Salvadoran president tried and convicted for illegal acts during his time in office.  Melendez, who made large strides in combating corruption in El Salvador, completed his three-year term in January.  It is unclear whether his successor, Raul Melara, will demonstrate the same commitment to combating corruption.   In July, El Salvador’s legislative assembly passed new legislation giving greater autonomy to the country’s Financial Investigation Unit (FIU), in an effort to comply with a request from the Egmont Group, a network of international FIUs.  However, a Presidential veto in August over constitutional concerns resulted in the suspension of El Salvador’s FIU from the Egmont Group, for its inability to maintain operational independence and autonomy.  The Legislative Assembly managed to override a presidential veto in October, following intense pressure by the international community, and the law will be reviewed by the Constitutional Chamber of the \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 166  Supreme Court.  El Salvador now has until July 2019 to avoid being expelled completely from Egmont, which could further complicate prosecution of corruption cases.    C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   The United States supports citizen security, law enforcement, and rule-of-law programs in El Salvador through the U.S. Strategy for Central America and the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), supporting El Salvador’s implementation of PESS and the Plan of the Alliance for Prosperity, a regional plan developed by the governments of El Salvador, Guatemala, and Honduras.  These programs aim to expand Salvadoran capabilities to interdict, investigate, and prosecute illegal drug trafficking and other transnational crimes, implement prevention programs, and strengthen El Salvador’s justice sector.  The United States also supports anti-gang and community policing in El Salvador with equipment, vehicles, training, and social and economic programs.  The United States provided Salvadoran law enforcement the ability to use COMPSTAT, a statistical analysis tool that tracks the type and location of crime reports to more efficiently allocate law enforcement resources; AFIS, an automated fingerprint database; and IBIS, a ballistics database.  In 2018, U.S. assistance focused on enhancing the operational capacity of Salvadoran law enforcement agencies to interdict drug shipments and combat money laundering and public corruption.  Assistance also promoted transparency, efficiency, and institutional respect for human and civil rights within law enforcement agencies and the criminal justice system, including efforts to professionalize the PNC and reduce the role of the military in civilian policing.  The United States supported efforts to combat transnational criminal organizations, particularly the MS-13 and 18th Street gangs, while developing and implementing integrated initiatives to disrupt drug trafficking and other criminal activity.  In 2018, U.S. assistance included specialized training for over 1,000 PNC officers in areas such as intelligence-led policing, community relations, and complex investigations.  The United States also helped strengthen the effectiveness of criminal justice procedures and practices by training 349 justice sector personnel in asset forfeiture, advanced investigation, and trial skills.  The United States also provided technical assistance to increase coordination between justice sector agents and institutions; improve criminal investigations using scientific evidence; and build the capacity of the police and prosecutor’s offices.  The August 2000 United States-El Salvador bilateral agreement allows U.S. authorities to use the El Salvador International Airport as a forward operating location.  It also allows U.S. access to ports and other governmental facilities in connection with aerial detection, monitoring, and tracking of illicit drug trafficking operations.  El Salvador is a regular participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring together maritime counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international organizations spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  D.  Conclusion   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 167  El Salvador maintained its capacity to fight transnational crime in 2018, even as drug traffickers continued to shift their maritime routes further from El Salvador’s coast and beyond its territorial waters.  Authorities demonstrated increased capacity to lead complex investigations, coordinate and share intelligence between agencies and with overseas counterparts, and dismantle organized crime structures.  El Salvador still faces formidable challenges, including the political uncertainty of the future Attorney General and President following the February 2019 national elections.   The successes of 2018 can only be sustained if the Government of El Salvador demonstrates continued commitment to crime prevention, security, and rule of law.  Progress in these fields, and the emergence of law enforcement actors capable of sharing information and coordinating effectively with international partners, likely contributed to the 2018 decline in maritime drug trafficking, but continued strengthening of the entire continuum of El Salvador’s criminal justice institutions needs to be strengthened to prevent the return of trafficking routes if interdiction efforts in neighboring countries continue to advance.  Political will to confront corruption and maintain adequate resources for the DAN and Attorney General’s Office, including adequate pay and physical protection, remains a challenge, and the corrections system remains overcrowded and mismanaged.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 168  Georgia  Georgia’s location along traditional smuggling routes in the Caucuses leaves it vulnerable to transnational criminal organizations that continue to traffic opium, heroin, and the main precursor chemical used to produce heroin, acetic anhydride.  In April 2018, 15 metric tons of acetic anhydride were seized at Georgia’s port of Poti on the Black Sea – one of the largest seizures in history.  The chemicals originated in China and were destined for Afghanistan to process heroin.  Despite record high opium production in Afghanistan, drug seizures in Georgia have declined since 2016.    The Georgian government and non-governmental organizations report substantial drug and substance abuse challenges with an estimated 50,000 illicit drug users in the country.  Synthetic and “club” drugs remain the most popular, particularly with the younger generation.  April 2018 police raids on two popular Georgian nightclubs led to riots in Tbilisi.  Thousands protested the raids as excessive abuses of authority and urged authorities to introduce less strict drug policies.  Georgian authorities expressed concern that this type of citizen response may hinder future drug operations for fear of reprisal.  In July 2018, the Constitutional Court of Georgia ruled unconstitutional blanket restrictions on marijuana use.  The Constitutional Court also noted that imposing responsibility on marijuana use would be reasonable under specific circumstances such as threats to third persons, use in educational facilities, use on public transport, and use in the presence of juveniles.  There is insufficient evidence to evaluate whether this will affect the consumption, sale, and transit of other illicit drugs.  The Government of Georgia actively cooperates with a wide range of actors to combat drug trafficking and consumption and to develop comprehensive responses to drug dependency.  These partners include civil society, academia, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime and other international organizations, regional partner states, and the European Union.    The United States continues to support Georgia’s fight against crime and illicit drug use and trafficking.  Georgia Minister of Internal Affairs Giorgi Gakharia met with the acting administrator of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration on July 25, 2018, and both parties affirmed their commitment to bilateral relations and combating drug trafficking in Georgia and the Caucasus region.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 169   Ghana  Ghana remains a transit and destination point for illicit drugs trafficked from Asia and South America to other African nations, Europe, and the United States.  Heroin and controlled pharmaceuticals from Asia, as well as cocaine from South America, are smuggled into the country for limited local consumption and onward shipment.  Crystal methamphetamine produced in clandestine laboratories in Nigeria also transits the country.  Precursor chemicals required to produce crystal methamphetamine are believed to be diverted from Ghanaian sources.  Cannabis is also produced in substantial quantities within Ghana, primarily for domestic use but also trafficked to international markets.  Officials report that the illegal importation and abuse of tramadol, a controlled pharmaceutical, is increasingly problematic.  Ghana law enforcement and intelligence agencies have alleged that transnational drug trafficking networks operating in the country have links to organized crime and terrorist organizations.  Preliminary reports indicate that the volume of cocaine and heroin seized by Ghanaian authorities in 2018 was slightly less than in previous years, while the volume of seized cannabis increased.  However, fragmented data collection and incomplete information sharing make accurate figures difficult to obtain.  Ghana’s government continues to push for modifications to its drug control laws.  The Narcotics Control Commission Bill, which is pending approval in Parliament, will direct the government to treat drug use as a public health issue.  It will also address gaps in interagency coordination and enhance the government’s toolset for fighting precursor chemicals.  The legislation would reduce the stringent mandatory five-year imprisonment for possession and personal use of illicit drugs.  The mandatory minimum sentence of 10 years would remain for trafficking.  Ghana maintained a high degree of cooperation with the United States and other international partners on drug control issues in 2018.  The United States and Ghana continued successful law enforcement cooperation under the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration’s Sensitive Investigative Unit program.  Supported by U.S. funding, the UN Office on Drugs and Crime continued to implement a program to provide training and equipment to new drug law enforcement units in four regions.  Ghana continues to work productively with international partners on law enforcement operations targeting transnational drug trafficking organizations and to attend U.S.-sponsored trainings that improve their capabilities.  There is no mutual legal assistance treaty between Ghana and the United States, although mutual legal assistance can be provided on a reciprocal basis through letters of request.  Extradition between Ghana and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 170  Guatemala  A. Introduction  Guatemala is a transit country for precursor chemicals and illicit drugs bound for U.S. markets.  Well-established criminal networks exploit the country’s strategic location, porous borders, and widespread corruption to facilitate drug trafficking through the country.  Although precise volumes are difficult to determine, U.S. authorities estimate transnational criminal organizations smuggled more than 1,400 metric tons (MT) of cocaine through Guatemala during 2018 by air, land, and sea.  While the bulk of cocaine arrives directly from South America via maritime conveyances, noncommercial air and overland smuggling from Panama, Costa Rica, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Honduras remain persistent threats.  Mexican cartels rely on Guatemalan networks and organizations to receive, store, and transport drugs to the United States through Mexico.    In addition to trafficking illicit drugs and precursor chemicals through Guatemala, criminal organizations cultivate cannabis and opium poppy within the country, and coca cultivation was detected for the first time in 2018.  The absence of a permanent law enforcement presence in many areas of the country allows other forms of transnational crime, including alien smuggling and trafficking in persons, weapons, counterfeit goods, and other contraband, to flourish.  Ongoing political crises and high turnover of key government officials present challenges to U.S. cooperation on security and countering drug trafficking.  Key Guatemalan government drug control officials lack the necessary political will to effectively counter drug trafficking and corruption.  While Guatemala achieved some notable successes in 2018, including high levels of drug seizures and a number of extraditions of criminals charged with drug offenses in the United States, Guatemala’s fight against criminal organizations continues to be hindered by endemic corruption, weak public institutions, and inadequate resources.  U.S. assistance helped establish 99 Model Police Precincts (MPP) throughout Guatemala.  In 2018, these locations improved citizen security and the relationships between police and the communities they serve.  A decline in homicides and other violent crimes, noted since 2009, continues, and local police are embracing community-policing methods.  MPPs support broader drug control efforts by facilitating positive interaction with police and improving communities’ trust in and willingness to work with police, thereby making communities more resilient to crime including crime with a nexus to drug trafficking, distribution, and drug use.        B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1. Institutional Development  High volumes of cocaine are trafficked into Guatemala along its Pacific Coast, although trends suggest much of the flow moved offshore in favor of direct routes from Colombia to Mexico for much of 2018.  The Guatemalan Special Naval Forces (FEN) has been successful in disrupting maritime networks, pushing maritime trafficking further west, and 2018 was another record year in seizures.  The FEN continues to face myriad maritime threats and trafficking challenges, \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 171  including the use of semi-submersible and low-profile vessels; small “pangas” boats; parasitic devices attached to larger ships; and an increase in “go-fast” vessels that are faster and hold larger shipments than pangas.  In response to FEN pressure at sea, traffickers increasingly turned to aerial conveyance in 2018, with considerable success.  Guatemala lacks the capacity to intercept inbound aircraft suspected of trafficking drugs, and trafficking organizations are easily capable of shifting landing locations as necessary.  The Guatemalan Air Force plays a critical role in detecting and monitoring aircraft suspected of trafficking illicit drugs in and out of Guatemala, but lacks capacity, including rotary wing assets.  Guatemalan interdiction efforts resulted in the seizure of a single air-delivered cocaine load in 2018 (on the ground) and the seizure of several aircraft, including some hidden by traffickers in remote locations.  Guatemalan agencies only disabled two suspected clandestine airfields in 2018, and one of those returned to operational use within two weeks.  Traffickers will likely continue to exploit Guatemala’s capacity gaps in this sector.    U.S. assistance to Guatemala in the areas of vetted units, information sharing, and training led to better coordination and drug seizures in 2018.  U.S. support to the border police (DIPAFRONT) enabled the addition of 100 agents to its force, now totaling 530, and the agency implemented successful binational operations with Mexico, Honduras, and El Salvador in 2018.  Challenges still remain, including lack of infrastructure, equipment, supplies, and personnel.  Guatemalan and U.S. law enforcement experts have estimated that 2,500 DIPAFRONT agents are needed to effectively patrol Guatemala’s borders.   Guatemala is a party to several relevant regional agreements, including the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, the Caribbean Regional Agreement on Maritime Counter Narcotics, and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  A maritime drug control agreement with the United States is fully implemented.  Guatemala continues to work closely with U.S. authorities on extradition matters and regularly extradites its own citizens, including high-level drug traffickers, to the United States for prosecution.  2. Supply Reduction  In May 2018, nearly 75,000 coca plants were discovered by Guatemalan authorities on one hectare (ha) of land in the municipality of Cobán.  This was the first known identification of coca cultivation within Guatemala, and the plants were subsequently destroyed.   The Guatemalan government continues to struggle with estimating the number of ha under opium poppy cultivation in the San Marcos region, close to the border with Mexico.  Guatemalan government authorities do not have an accurate estimate, and limited government presence and operations since the state of emergency in 2017 have reduced visibility into the current situation.  While government authorities have informally claimed there is less poppy cultivation due to declining prices, there is no independent confirmation of these claims.  High turnover in Guatemalan agencies led to the cancelation and/or delay of multiple eradication missions in \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 172  2018, and budgeted alternative development projects planned for San Marcos were not implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture.    Seizures increased each year since 2016 despite insufficient interdiction resources.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Guatemalan authorities reported seizing approximately 13.96 MT of cocaine, surpassing the total amount seized during all of 2017.  During this same period, Guatemalan agencies reported confiscating seven kilograms of heroin, more than $3.6 million in bulk cash, and eradicating approximately 80 ha of opium poppy and 40 ha of cannabis.    Arrests of high-profile traffickers were down in 2018 to 53, approximately half the number arrested in 2017.  3.    Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  A U.S.-funded national drug-use survey released in 2014 remains the most recent.  That survey reported young people aged 11 to 20 used marijuana and cocaine at higher rates than their counterparts in Mexico, Colombia, and Costa Rica.  It also identified specific risk factors for Guatemalan adolescents, including easy access to illicit drugs, as well as low risk perception associated with the use of marijuana, cocaine, and MDMA (ecstasy).  Since the government lacks sufficient resources to address these emerging trends, a U.S. government grant helped reach over 19,000 students and promote drug abuse awareness and prevention among municipal leaders, teachers, students, parents, and the private sector.   The Ministry of Health administers drug treatment centers in Guatemala, but the agency has not provided updated statistics on treatment centers.  A 2016 U.S.-funded study of 30 of the country’s 100 treatment centers concluded the majority of drug treatment providers, directors, and counselors lack expertise to meet the needs of patients.  Most centers lack basic equipment and do not apply a formal therapeutic model to drug treatment.   Guatemalan authorities are concerned about internal drug use and have provided additional resources to fight it, but resources remain insufficient.  There is some evidence that criminal organizations are attempting to create demand for illicit drugs in Guatemala to generate new markets.  The coca plantation discovered in May, for example, appeared designed to meet internal consumption demands.  4. Corruption  The Guatemalan government does not, as a matter of policy, encourage or facilitate illegal drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in the laundering of the sale of illicit drug proceeds.  However, corruption permeates public and private institutions and exacerbates the country’s security, governance, and economic challenges.  Guatemala’s Attorney General and the UN-backed International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (CICIG) have investigated hundreds of government officials suspected of corruption.  U.S. assistance also supports anticorruption efforts by developing and training specialized vetted units, particularly those tasked with countering drug trafficking, money laundering, and criminal gangs.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 173  Accomplishments in the broader fight against corruption in 2018 included several high profile corruption cases resulting in convictions, including former Vice President Roxana Baldetti.  She was convicted in the first of several corruption cases and sentenced to more than 15 years in prison.  Former Minister of Government, Mauricio Lopez-Bonilla, was also convicted and received a sentence of more than eight years.  U.S. officials assisted efforts to build capacity for police and prosecutorial units that apply enhanced special investigative methods.  As a result of investigations, several asset forfeiture cases allowed Guatemala to recover more than $4.5 million, along with more than 100 assets, such as vehicles, airplanes, boats, real property, and equipment.  The seized property will be sold or donated to state institutions and help strengthen state institutions involved in the fight against corruption.  Unfortunately, the government’s expulsion of CICIG from Guatemala calls into question its commitment to fight entrenched corruption.     C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  Consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Central America and the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), and in support of the Central American governments’ Alliance for Prosperity, the United States continues to be a key provider of assistance to improve the professional capabilities and integrity of Guatemala’s security and judicial institutions to create sustainable, effective structures and organizations to fight illicit drug production and trafficking.  The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Guatemala to suppress illicit traffic by sea and air, which includes provisions for ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry to investigate, over flight of territorial seas, order to land, and interdiction support.  Guatemala also participates in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit, which attracts counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central, and South America, as well as Europe.    D. Conclusion  Guatemala made progress in the fight against criminal organizations in 2018, including enhanced institutional capacity, improved interagency and regional cooperation, and record interdictions.  Significant challenges remain, including high turnover of government officials in key law enforcement roles and lack of political will in key areas.  Corruption levels remain high, and, according to U.S. government-funded studies, public confidence in government institutions is low.  Following the government’s actions against CICIG, there is growing concern about high-level Guatemalan commitment to the fight against corruption and impunity.  Limited budget resources hinder the government’s effectiveness and ability to address the challenges associated with drug trafficking.  The Guatemalan government needs to work to build sustainable counterdrug mechanisms, including accelerated judicial processes, improved interagency cooperation, and provide adequate financial support and personnel to relevant agencies and government ministries.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 174  Guyana  A.  Introduction   Guyana is a transit country for cocaine destined for the United States, Canada, the Caribbean, Europe, and West Africa.  Cocaine originating in Colombia is smuggled to Venezuela and onward to Guyana by sea or air.  Smugglers also transit land borders and the shared river network with Brazil, Venezuela, and Suriname.  Cocaine is concealed in legitimate commodities and smuggled through commercial and private air transport, maritime vessels, human couriers, “go-fast” boats, and various postal systems.  Drug traffickers are attracted by the country’s poorly monitored ports, remote airstrips, intricate river networks, porous land borders, as well as corruption and under-resourced security sector.  Despite these challenges, the Government of Guyana has demonstrated political will to combat the trafficking of illicit drugs in and through Guyana.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development  The Government of Guyana’s drug control institutions are the Guyana Police Force, Guyana Revenue Authority, Customs Anti-Narcotics Unit, Special Organized Crime Unit, and Guyana Defence Force.  These agencies are responsible for the implementation of the National Drug Strategy Master Plan 2016-2020, and the National Anti-Narcotics Agency oversees these efforts.  Despite this coordination mechanism, corruption and limited resources have historically limited the effectiveness of these drug control agencies.  In February 2018, the Government of Guyana passed the Witness Protection Act and the Protected Disclosures Act to complement its existing legislative regime addressing corruption and drug trafficking.     In 2008, Guyana acceded to and has since filed information requests under the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, to which the United States is also a party.  Guyana has bilateral drug control agreements with its neighbors and the United Kingdom.  Guyana is also a member of the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission (OAS/CICAD).  Guyana signed a maritime drug control bilateral agreement with the United States in 2001, but has yet to take the necessary domestic action to bring the agreement into effect.  The 1931 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom is applicable to the United States and Guyana, and Guyana honors that treaty.   2.  Supply Reduction   The Government of Guyana’s National Drug Abuse Control Unit trains public health officers, teachers, social workers, and civil society groups as part of the government’s supply reduction strategy.  The Guyanese government has a drug enforcement presence at its international airports, post offices, and, to a lesser extent, at seaport and land-border entry points.  Drug \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 175  control agencies reported several interdiction efforts and drug-related seizures and convictions during the first nine months of 2018.  During the first nine months of 2018, authorities seized 164.9 kilograms (kg) of cocaine and 889 kg of cannabis.  Guyanese authorities initiated 358 prosecutions and convicted 24 individuals for drug trafficking.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Guyana has a growing domestic drug consumption problem.  Marijuana is the most widely used illicit drug in Guyana, followed by cocaine.  The Guyanese government has also reported seizing smaller amounts of synthetic drugs, including MDMA (ecstasy).  Guyana has a comprehensive demand reduction strategy that adequately addresses drug rehabilitation.  The Ministry of Public Health, Ministry of Education, and Ministry of Social Protection are responsible for addressing demand reduction.  Non-governmental organizations also offer rehabilitation services, with the government providing financial assistance.  The Georgetown Public Hospital also provides free rehabilitation services for drug users.  The University of Guyana has a demand reduction curriculum in place through OAS/CICAD funding.  The Government of Guyana conducts anti-drug awareness sessions in secondary schools and has plans to create drug treatment courts.  As part of the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI), the United States supports Guyana through targeted training for law enforcement and maritime officers.      4.  Corruption   As a matter of policy, the Government of Guyana does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of narcotics or psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  However, a lack of resources, weak law enforcement institutions, an ineffective judicial system, and inadequate compensation for civil service employees and public safety officials facilitate corruption throughout all sectors.         C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence affecting Guyanese citizens, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean countries that seeks to substantially reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  Efforts to increase law enforcement capabilities, protect borders, air and seaports, strengthen workforce development, and promote anti-money laundering effectiveness directly address priority concerns shared by Guyana and the United States.  The Government of Guyana cooperates very closely with all relevant U.S. agencies and departments, but is limited by resource constraints.  The current administration, which took office in May 2015, has expressed a strong willingness to cooperate with the United States on drug control, extradition, mutual legal assistance, and other international crime issues.  CBSI-funded programs support Guyana’s maritime operations by providing interdiction assets, relevant command and control systems, and associated logistical support and training.  In 2018, the United States provided port and maritime training to Guyana’s Coast Guard.  U.S. assistance \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 176  programs also promote law enforcement professionalization and more effective drug investigations.  By strengthening Guyana’s drug control capacities, the United States seeks to enhance interagency coordination within the Guyanese government including to gather better information on drug trafficking routes.  D.  Conclusion  The United States enjoys strong cooperation with Guyana in advancing mutual interests against the threat of international drug trafficking.  Guyana has shown strong interest in furthering collaboration under CBSI.  The United States looks forward to tangible progress on investigations, prosecutions, and extraditions; expanding security sector capacity; engaging at-risk communities; and enforcing laws against money laundering and financial crimes.  To advance cooperation, Guyana should take steps to implement the 2001 counterdrug bilateral agreement with the United States to suppress illicit trafficking by sea and air.  Guyana should seek to enhance its anti-corruption initiatives and fully pursue prosecutions for drug trafficking in accordance with its laws.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 177  Haiti  A.  Introduction  Haiti remains a transit point for cocaine originating in South America and marijuana originating in Jamaica, traversing the country’s porous borders en route to the United States and other markets.  This traffic takes advantage of Haiti’s severely under-patrolled maritime borders and its extensive land border with the Dominican Republic.  Haiti’s main drug enforcement unit, Le Bureau de Lutte Contre le trafic de Stupèfiants (Bureau for the Fight Against Narcotics, or BLTS) led several successful investigations and joint interdiction operations against drug trafficking organizations along the southern coast in 2018.  Haiti is not a significant producer of illicit drugs for export, although there is cultivation of cannabis for local consumption.  Haiti’s primarily subsistence-level economy does not provide an environment conducive to high levels of domestic drug use.  In 2018, the Haitian National Police (HNP) strengthened the BLTS with additional officers, and officials at the highest levels of the government have spoken about the need to fight drug trafficking.  However, seizures of illicit drugs and smuggled cash declined and the government is unable to secure the country’s borders to stem the flow of illicit drugs.  The HNP and the Haitian government have recently begun to address the uncontrolled border crossings with the formation of a border police unit (POLIFRONT), based in Morne Casse, near the Ouanaminthe border crossing with the Dominican Republic in Haiti’s Northeast Department.  POLIFRONT plans to expand to border crossing points at Anse-a-Pitre, Malpasse, and Belladere.  The minimal maritime interdiction capacity of the Haitian Coast Guard (HCG) creates a low-risk environment for drug traffickers.  While Haiti’s interdiction capacity has improved marginally, a largely ineffective judicial system continues to impede successful prosecution of apprehended drug traffickers.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1. Institutional Development  The HNP’s 28th Promotion Class graduated 1,022 recruits, including 117 women, in December 2017.  The 29th HNP class of 692 recruits graduated in September 2018, bringing the total number of HNP officers to nearly 16,000.  A larger force will help the HNP assume increasing responsibility for security as the UN Mission for Justice Support in Haiti starts to drawdown by October 2019.  The BLTS focuses on interdicting illicit drug trafficking.  In 2018, the HNP deployed BLTS officers to Terrier Rouge and Ouanaminthe.  The BLTS also plans to add officers in Jacmel in the Southeast Department, as well as in Anse-a-Pitres.  The United States continues to provide training to the Maritime Counter Narcotics Task Force, made up of BLTS and HCG officers.  In April, the United States finished installing a modular unit at the Cap Haitien seaport for BLTS officers to use as an operational base.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 178  The HNP’s Office of the Inspector General (OIG) investigates reports of officer misconduct, including participation in drug trafficking.  The HNP still faces challenges regulating its internal affairs, particularly in more remote areas in Haiti.  The OIG recommended officers for discipline for various offenses in 2018, but most of its recommendations have thus far gone unmet.  The HNP held monthly press conferences to inform the public of their roles and responsibilities, and to report cases of misconduct.  The OIG maintains a 24-hour hotline to receive public reports of police corruption or misconduct.  As of August 2018, the OIG had recommended 23 officers for dismissal, compared with 11 such recommendations in 2017.   The HCG is the sole maritime enforcement agency in the country.  An additional 42 officers from the 29th HNP promotion class joined the HCG, bringing the overall size of the unit to 204 officers.  The HCG has operating bases in Cap Haitien, Killick (Port-au-Prince), and Les Cayes.  The force has 15 maritime vessels, but only five are currently operational, with seven of the remaining 10 vessels non-repairable due to age.  Maritime domain awareness and enforcement are daunting tasks for the HCG, considering Haiti’s 1,100 miles of coastline and seven international ports.  Operational capacity remains low due to insufficient funding, management deficiencies, an inability to refuel, and unavailability of locally procured parts to maintain the vessels.  These issues have prevented the HCG from serving as an effective deterrent force to maritime drug trafficking.     Haiti maintains several international agreements on drug control commitments and often cooperates effectively with the United States on drug-related cases.  A 1997 bilateral letter of agreement on Cooperation to Suppress Illicit Maritime Drug Traffic allows U.S. law enforcement agencies to enter Haitian territorial waters and airspace in pursuit of suspect vessels or aircraft, to board and search suspect vessels, to patrol Haitian airspace, and to carry members of the HCG as passengers.  Although there is no mutual legal assistance treaty between Haiti and the United States, the Haitian government has cooperated on many cases within the limits of Haitian law.  A bilateral extradition treaty entered into force in 1905, and the Government of Haiti has willingly surrendered persons under indictment in the United States to U.S. law enforcement agencies.  2. Supply Reduction  During the first 10 months of 2018, BLTS executed several operations that resulted in the seizure of 371 kilograms (kg) of marijuana and 28 kg of cocaine.  In addition, the HNP arrested 76 suspects for drug-related crimes during this period.  There is no significant availability or traffic of illicit synthetic drugs in Haiti.  3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Illicit drug abuse is uncommon in Haiti, as the population’s minimal discretionary income mitigates against a widespread drug abuse problem.  The Government of Haiti runs small-scale public awareness and demand reduction programs funded through the drug control policy commission (CONALD), but there is no data on these programs’ impact or usefulness.  4. Corruption \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 179   The Haitian government as an institution does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking, or the laundering of proceeds from illicit drug transactions.  However, effective government action to fight corruption, particularly related to illicit drugs, is constrained by two major factors coupled with a lack of political will.  The first is a historically weak legal framework.  Haiti did not codify corruption as a crime until 2014, when a law formally criminalized public corruption and set penalties for bribery and illegal procurement.  Implementation of this law, including training of judicial personnel on the law’s requirements, remains a challenge.  Haiti’s asset seizure laws have enabled the financial intelligence unit (Central Unit of Financial Investigations) and the HNP’s financial crimes unit (Financial and Economic Affairs Bureau) to seize the assets of drug traffickers convicted outside of Haiti.  The Haitian constitution’s grant of blanket immunity from prosecution to Members of Parliament is a point of concern for anticorruption and drug enforcement efforts.  The second constraining factor is systematically poor judicial performance, due to antiquated penal and criminal procedural codes, opaque court proceedings, lack of judicial oversight, and widespread judicial corruption.  To date, there have been five successful convictions for drug trafficking, and only one conviction on corruption-related charges in Haitian courts.  The Haitian Anti-Corruption Unit has advanced 32 corruption-related cases to the judiciary since its inception in 2005, but without tangible results.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  U.S. drug control initiatives in Haiti focus on improving the capacity of the HNP, BLTS, and the HCG to detect, investigate, and deter the flow of illicit drugs.  A 2004 letter of agreement (as amended) between the United States and Haiti and a second agreement signed in 2013 (amended annually) govern these activities.  Core goals outlined in the agreements are to increase overall counter-drug capabilities, interdict drug shipments, and develop cases against traffickers and criminal organizations.  Since 2012, five drug-related arrests have led to trials and convictions.     U.S. assistance supports the development of the HNP and the targeted support of BLTS via complementary programs.  Support to the HNP covers a broad range of activities, including infrastructure, equipment, and training.  Improved operational capacity and professionalism of the HNP are necessary for effective drug enforcement activity in Haiti.    Specific U.S. support to the BLTS includes provision of communications equipment, vehicles, non-lethal operational gear, canine and maritime units, and training.  U.S. support also includes training opportunities for BLTS officers in the United States and in third countries, such as at the U.S.-supported International Law Enforcement Academy (ILEA) in El Salvador.  The United States also supports the HNP’s Joint Maritime Counternarcotics Task Force through joint enforcement operations between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, the U.S. Coast Guard, the HCG, and the BLTS.    The United States will continue to support training of high-ranking HNP officials in the United States, including in cooperation with various U.S. law enforcement agencies, to develop leaders that can serve as change agents within the HNP. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 180   D.  Conclusion  The continued institutional development of both the HNP and BLTS is a positive trend that has helped improve public security and has marginally increased Haiti’s capacity to interdict drug trafficking.  However, the dysfunctional Haitian judicial system drastically limits domestic prosecution of drug cases and thus reduces disincentives to trafficking operations.  Drug seizures remain low, and Haiti’s minimal capacity to police its sea and land borders continues to be a particular point of concern.    Continued U.S. engagement in support of BLTS operations and general HNP development will help Haitian law enforcement capitalize on marginal gains in drug interdiction capacity.  The benefits of such gains will be limited, however, if the judicial system remains weak, corrupt, and fails to convict drug traffickers.  Only the concurrent strengthening of political will, the judiciary, law enforcement, and border security will enable Haiti to make real progress in combating drug trafficking.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 181  Honduras  A.  Introduction  Honduras is a transit country for cocaine destined for the United States and precursor chemicals used to produce illicit drugs.  The Caribbean Coast of Honduras is vulnerable to drug trafficking by land, sea, and air due to its remoteness, limited infrastructure, and lack of government presence.  Drug trafficking organizations are shifting their strategy to take advantage of these vulnerabilities by sending smaller shipments by fast boat or small airplane, making detection and interdiction increasingly challenging for Honduran authorities.  Despite advances, the overall security situation in Honduras remains challenging.  While the homicide rate continues to drop, the overall crime rate remains high especially where elevated levels of criminal activity make it difficult for the under-resourced Honduras National Police (HNP) to operate.  Transnational criminal street gangs, such as Mara Salvatrucha (MS-13) and 18th Street, are not a significant part of the international drug logistics chain, except as facilitators of shipments through Honduras and small-scale local distributors.  The restructuring of the HNP, improvements in investigative and operational training for both the police and Public Ministry (PM), and the use of interagency task forces to strike against traffickers increased the interoperability of government entities to counter drug trafficking.  Drug seizures by the HNP in 2018 surpassed 2017 levels.  The Honduran government initiated a purge of the HNP in 2016 to remove corrupt or otherwise unqualified officers from duty; 5,218 HNP officers have been removed from duty as of November 1, 2018.  The HNP’s lack of strong, mid-level management following the police purge along with a dearth of officers with significant counterdrug experience has hampered the force from staying ahead of evolving drug smuggling threats.  However, the Government of Honduras continues its efforts to develop capacity to counter drug trafficking, and to increase seizures and disrupt criminal networks.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1. Institutional Development  The political will of the Honduran government to combat drug trafficking and to coordinate with U.S. law enforcement agencies in doing so remains high.  Challenges for drug control institutions include corruption, inadequate budget resources, and persistent violence.  Corruption, combined with low tax collection rates, deprives law enforcement agencies, courts, and prosecutors of critical resources.  The security tax, instituted in 2014 to offset funding challenges for security agencies, helped key law enforcement institutions somewhat, but funds are inadequate to meet the significant personnel, equipment, and technology needs required to address drug trafficking in Honduras.    U.S. assistance to Honduras in the areas of vetted police units, interagency task forces, criminal justice capacity building, information sharing, and training provided a foundation for government institutions to coordinate their efforts in the fight against the trafficking of illicit drugs.  During 2018, the Government of Honduras emphasized interagency operations focused \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 182  on specific geographic areas experiencing spikes in criminal activity.  These operations have resulted in a high number of arrests, arms seizures, and significant marijuana seizures, but have not yielded notable cocaine seizures or disruptions to drug trafficking organizations.  The HNP Special Forces Directorate’s elite unit, the TIGRES, has been instrumental in providing the tactical, operational support required for these operations.  The HNP Antinarcotics Directorate (DNPA), created in 2018, began tactical operations in September with support from other HNP Directorates.  The DNPA faces various challenges associated with being a new police directorate.  As of October, the DNPA had 135 personnel, the bulk of whom are recent police academy graduates or officers with limited experience in drug operations.  DNPA does not have an established headquarters, so personnel and leadership work from various locations.  In January 2018, the HNP moved the Financial Crimes Task Force (OPIF) from the Directorate of Police Investigations to the DNPA to address the financial aspects of drug investigations.  The U.S. government provides advisory support to the DNPA in the areas of organizational development, inter-directorate information sharing, operational planning, and financial investigations.   The U.S.-supported HNP Criminal Investigation School (EIC) provides coursework on the classification of illicit drugs, pharmacology, clandestine laboratories, chemical precursors, and trafficking methods, and incorporates drug control topics in all other courses offered.  The HNP remains committed to utilizing continuing education as a means to professionalize their force generally, but also as a way to improve the investigative capacity of the force to counter drug trafficking.  The Honduran National Congress increased the EIC budget from approximately $20,000 in 2016 to $1.3 million in 2018.  The Government of Honduras is also investing, with support from U.S. and international donors, in a specialized training academy that will include a dedicated school for counterdrug training.  Honduras is party to several regional agreements that focus on drug trafficking, including the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission and the Caribbean Regional Agreement on Maritime Counternarcotics.  Honduras has ratified the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.   2.  Supply Reduction  The willingness of civilian and military entities to combat illicit drug trafficking and steps taken by the Government of Honduras over previous years to create new drug control entities has not yet translated into significant increases in drug seizures or notable disruptions to drug trafficking organizations.  Drug trafficking organizations, recognizing the improved capabilities of Honduran security forces, have begun moving drug shipments in smaller amounts to avoid detection and interdiction by Honduran authorities.  While seizures by Honduran authorities in their territorial and maritime domain are down, there is no concrete information to suggest the overall volume of illicit drugs being trafficked through Honduras has decreased.  During the first nine months of 2018, there was a threefold increase in seizures of cocaine transiting Honduras according to U.S. government data, seized mostly by non–Honduran authorities in territories outside of Honduras.  In contrast to this assessment, in September, the Ministry of Defense claimed that Honduras achieved a 50 percent reduction in the volume of drugs transiting \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 183  Honduras, and destroyed nearly 50 clandestine airstrips.  The U.S. government is still working to corroborate this information.  The Honduran Navy made efforts during 2018 to modernize its surface fleet and initiated the purchase of new vessels, but has not made a commensurate increase in operational budget and it is uncertain when the vessels will become an active part of the fleet.  Fuel availability is a significant limitation for the Honduran Navy to interdict suspected drug trafficking vessels, as these ships often operate at long distances from the Navy’s control nodes and current fuel budgets are miniscule compared to the need.    The military controls wiretapping facilities and access to wiretapping results for civilian law enforcement remains inadequate, resulting in a significant loss of actionable intelligence for interdictions that could occur on land.  The U.S. government is working with the Ministry of Security to gain additional access to the wiretapping facilities to assist in the development of intelligence for drug control entities.    The Ministry of Defense stated an interest in increasing information sharing with the United States on both licit and illicit maritime activities.  Furthermore, the U.S. government began discussions in 2018 with the Ministry of Defense to train and outfit a Maritime Interdiction Unit (Fuerzas Especiales Navales) to be modeled after a similar U.S.-supported unit in Guatemala.  The current aerial interdiction law in Honduras prevents the United States from sharing radar or other information related to illicit trafficking by air.  The Honduran government does not currently have the capacity to track all suspected drug trafficking flights into or out of clandestine airstrips without outside support.   The analytic capabilities of the Merchant Marine (DGMM) Department of Analysis and Maritime Control, created in 2016, continue to improve and support the fight against drug trafficking.  The Honduran Navy and the U.S. authorities receive the majority of DGMM’s intelligence, but the Honduran Navy is limited in its ability to make patrols based on this information because of resource constraints.  Poor port security, inadequate container inspection protocols, and complicated interagency procedures limit the ability of Honduran authorities to act on DGMM’s information on suspect vessels or containers in port.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  The primary focus of the Honduran government remains on improving security and economic conditions in Honduras.  Public information on drug use is insufficient.  Prevention and treatment programs are limited in both scope and geography.  The National Directorate of Investigation and Intelligence released a report in August 2018 identifying data collection on drug use as a critical gap that inhibits an appropriate approach to drug use prevention and treatment.  The DNPA’s Prevention Department is staffed by only two individuals, neither of whom have formal training in drug use prevention.   The United States supports comprehensive, balanced, and coordinated approaches to increase the capacity of the Government of Honduras to address and counter the demand for illegal drugs.  Assistance included support to the Gang Resistance Education and Training (GREAT) Program, \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 184  estimated to have reached 100,000 students in 2018.  Other U.S.-supported grants provided support to host country institutions that deal with drug treatment and prevention in the highest risk areas of Honduras.    4.  Corruption  The Government of Honduras does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  However, corruption remains widespread in public institutions.  The Special Commission for the Purging and Restructuring of the HNP completed its original mission to expel corrupt police officers from the force in 2017 and is slated to disband in January 2019.  The HNP continues to hire new police officers to achieve its target of 26,000 by 2022, and as of October 2018 numbered about 18,500 officers.   In April 2018, the OAS Mission to Support the Fight Against Corruption and Impunity in Honduras (MACCIH) completed two years of operations.  The Honduran anticorruption court and the PM’s Anti-Corruption Unit (UFECIC), stood up with the support of MACCIH, began to investigate and try high-level corruption cases.  Since late 2017, MACCIH has launched several large-scale corruption cases, including against current and former public officials.  An UFECIC and MACCIH investigation against former First Lady Rosa Elena Bonilla de Lobo for alleged misuse of public funds, fraud, and money laundering, led to her arrest in February 2018.  In June, UFECIC, in conjunction with MACCIH investigators, announced the Pandora Case.  The case accuses 38 individuals, including a former Secretary of Agriculture and several Congresspersons, of acts of fraud, money laundering, falsifying documents, and abuse of authority.  MACCIH continues to pursue a legislative agenda to strengthen anticorruption laws and reduce impunity.      C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States provides assistance through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI) to improve the professional capabilities of Honduran justice sector institutions, consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Engagement in Central America, and the Central American governments’ Alliance for Prosperity Initiative.  The overall objective of U.S. assistance is to reinforce Honduran security and justice sector institutions so they can account for their nation’s security, stability, and prosperity.    The U.S. government provides advisory and logistical support along with equipment to various HNP directorates, the PM, and the military to improve host country capacities to investigate and disrupt drug trafficking in Honduras.  Specifically, the United States trains and equips HNP special units such as the Violent Crimes Task Force, the National Anti-Kidnapping Unit, the TIGRES, and the Special Tactical Operations Group (GOET).  U.S. assistance to community policing efforts continued during 2018 and an additional seven Model Police Precincts (MPPs) were established.  These MPPs support broader drug control efforts by facilitating positive interaction with police and improving communities’ trust in and willingness to work with police, thereby making communities more resilient to crime including crime with a nexus to drug trafficking, distribution, and use.   U.S.-supported HNP vetted units include the Transnational \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 185  Anti-Gang Unit, the Sensitive Investigations Unit, and the Transnational Criminal Investigative Unit, which address drug trafficking and other transnational crime.      The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Honduras to suppress illicit traffic by sea, which includes provisions for shipboarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry to investigate, overflight, order to land and for the use of third-party platforms.  Honduras is a regular participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summits, which bring together counterdrug professionals from nearly 25 countries and over 65 international organizations spanning North, Central and South America, and Europe.  D.  Conclusion  The United States works closely with Honduran authorities to improve the host government’s capacity to provide security and justice to its citizens and combat drug trafficking.  In 2018, Honduras made progress in improving investigative capacity and the interoperability of security forces to fight criminal organizations but was not able to translate these improvements into notable disruptions to drug trafficking organizations.  Inadequate resources and the inability to interdict the frequent, small shipments of illicit drugs through Honduras remain as difficult challenges.  The Government of Honduras will need to continue on its path to reform its institutions, accelerate judicial processes, and provide adequate resources to its justice sector operators to achieve greater success against drug trafficking organizations.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 186  India  A.  Introduction  India’s geographic location and transport links make it an attractive transshipment point for illicit narcotics bound for Europe, Africa, Southeast Asia, and North America.  Cross-border heroin trafficking from Pakistan to India continues to be a major problem due to India’s porous borders and capacity deficits that prevent the Indian Border Security Forces (BSF) from reducing smuggling.    In 2018, India exported over $17 billion of licit pharmaceutical drugs, and it has been the leading generic drug manufacturer in the world for several years.  Estimates suggest that India exports twice the volume of pharmaceutical drugs as China.  Drug traffickers exploit this commercial infrastructure – and India’s rare combination of technical expertise and chemical source supplies – to market dangerous synthetic drugs in the United States and elsewhere.  U.S. and international law enforcement authorities have voiced concerns that transnational criminal organizations could target India’s pharmaceutical laboratories and chemists to produce illicit fentanyl and fentanyl analogues.  U.S.-based customers obtain illegal pharmaceutical drugs from India through online pharmacies, non-indexed web sites (“Dark Web”), or call centers.  Thousands of mail shipments of illicit pharmaceutical drugs are sent to the United States each year, feeding the current opioid epidemic.  Neighboring countries including Nepal and Bhutan have also identified Indian pharmaceutical drugs as a major problem.   Trafficking of the opioid tramadol from India is another serious drug control challenge.  India is the leading global producer of licit tramadol, and approximately 50 companies in the country are licensed to legitimately manufacture the drug.  However, billions of tablets of mostly counterfeit tramadol originating in India have been seized across Asia, Africa, and Europe.    India is authorized to produce licit opium for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals and is a major producer of precursor chemicals.  There is evidence that opium is also grown illicitly in India, especially in the country’s northeast.         India appears to be committed to addressing its drug-related challenges but faces resources and capacity limitations, as well as insufficient law enforcement presence relative to its population size.  Additionally, a lack of information technology, including integrated networks and case management software, hampers day-to-day enforcement of Indian drug laws.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  India continues to tighten regulations and increase law enforcement officer training.  However, the capacity of India’s drug law enforcement personnel to collect and analyze data and conduct complex criminal drug manufacturing and trafficking investigations remains limited by \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 187  inadequate training, a lack of modern equipment, insufficient staffing, and poor interagency coordination.   To fulfill India’s United Nations treaty obligations for drug control, the Government of India implemented the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (NDPS) Act, 1985.  This Act gave rise to the Narcotics Control Bureau (NCB), India’s primary drug agency responsible for combating and preventing narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.  In 2018, 24 NCB officers attended a week-long training conducted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) on precursor chemicals and diversion.  In addition to the NCB, India’s Directorate of Revenue Intelligence (DRI), Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN), Border Security Force (BSF), Indian Customs Service (ICS), and the Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) play a role in stemming the drug trafficking in India.  India’s DRI, housed under the Central Board of Indirect Taxes and Customs, is the primary anti-smuggling intelligence and investigative law enforcement agency.  Its responsibilities include investigating violations of the NDPS Act.  The Central Bureau of Narcotics (CBN) supervises the licit cultivation of opium poppy in India.  CBN is also responsible for the issuance of licenses required for the manufacture of synthetic narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances listed in the NDPS Act, as well as import/export authorizations for the movement of precursor chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs to and from India.  Furthermore, CBN is the central agency authorized to interact with the International Narcotics Control Board and international governments in supervising international transactions of regulated substances.  BSF and ICS share primary responsibility for monitoring India’s borders.  ICS manages official border crossing checkpoints with Pakistan and is responsible for checking all cargo and persons entering India.  However, porous borders and capacity issues limit both agencies’ effectiveness in combatting illegal smuggling, cultivation, and production.  The porous borders also contribute to the movement of Afghan-produced heroin throughout the region, enabling regional terrorist groups in Afghanistan and Pakistan.  BSF and ICS continue to lack the technology necessary to keep pace with traffickers.     India’s various national and state-level law enforcement agencies face challenges in institutionalizing effective coordination.  Poor intelligence exploitation during drug seizures limits investigative leads.  Lengthy delays between drug seizures and prosecutions also complicate efforts to develop an effective enforcement and prosecution strategy.  Finally, a lack of modern drug legislation and effective drug courts also severely hamper Indian law enforcement agencies’ ability to conduct complex drug conspiracy investigations.  The Government of India has entered into bilateral agreements or memoranda of understanding for mutual cooperation to reduce demand and prevent the illicit trafficking of narcotics, psychotropic substances, and precursor chemicals with 36 countries.  India participates in mutual legal assistance treaties with 39 countries, including the United States.  India also maintains extradition treaties with at least 28 countries plus additional extradition arrangements.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 188   2.  Supply Reduction  India has seen a sharp rise in pharmaceutical and chemical diversion cases with investigative links to the United States as illicit distributors increasingly connect with less-regulated markets such as India for their supply.  Online sales (over both surface and non-indexed websites) and call center operations based in India continue to feed the U.S. appetite for opioids.    Based on leads passed from the DEA, Indian drug authorities in Gujarat, Mumbai, and other cities within India, made numerous seizures of diverted controlled drugs in 2018, most of which were destined for the U.S. illicit market.  In 2018, Indian authorities acting on DEA information seized over 7.4 million tablets of tramadol destined for illicit diversion in the United States.  In September, DEA and DRI also worked together to safely dismantle the first known illicit fentanyl laboratory in India, and seized approximately 11 kilograms (kg) of fentanyl.    In June 2018, Indian law enforcement raided multiple pharmaceutical factories illegally producing ketamine, resulting in the seizure of approximately 308 kg of ketamine and two metric tons of raw materials to manufacture ketamine, hashish, cocaine, and opium.  The drug trafficking organization involved in these raids was responsible for trafficking ketamine to Australia, Canada, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, Malaysia, Mozambique, Nepal, Spain, Sri Lanka, Switzerland, the United Kingdom, and Vietnam, demonstrating India’s role as a central transit point for international drug trade.  One month later, officials seized approximately 300 additional kg of ketamine at two separate locations.  The first seizure of Indian fentanyl, believed to have been destined for the U.S. market, occurred in August 2018 in Mexico.  In September, Indian Law Enforcement in conjunction with DEA successfully arrested three individuals involved in the operation of a fentanyl laboratory including a Mexican cartel member and a PhD-level chemist.    In October 2018, Indian law enforcement officials arrested a Pakistani national involved in trafficking 300 kg of heroin near the Nepal border, with a believed terrorism nexus.  Seizures of MDMA (ecstasy) and ketamine manufactured in India have also been observed.  In 2017 (the most recent data available as of this report), NCB continued to use satellite imagery and other intelligence methods to track and reduce illicit poppy cultivation.  NCB’s coordination and enforcement resulted in the identification and destruction of over 2,430 hectares (ha) of opium poppies (compared to 2,635 ha in 2016).  The U.S. government has not validated these figures.  In India’s northeast, where illicit poppy production is widespread, insurgent groups reportedly protect the poppy sites in exchange for compensation from traffickers and cultivators, complicating NCB efforts to identify and eradicate the sites.  In 2017, cannabis cultivation was also detected, totaling about 3,446 ha.  This supply was subsequently destroyed.  The U.S. government has not validated this data.    3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 189  There is significant pharmaceutical drug abuse in the country, with a ready supply of drugs available over the counter at most pharmacies.  However, given India’s size and large population, accurate estimates of the extent, pattern, and nature of its drug problem are difficult.  Commonly reported drugs of abuse in India include heroin, opium, cocaine, ephedrine, cannabis, and MDMA.  India’s Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment (MSJE) and NCB manage India’s public demand reduction strategy, which promotes drug abuse awareness, education, counseling, and treatment programs – and trains demand reduction volunteers.    Additionally, India’s National AIDS Control Organization (NACO) is implementing programs to reduce public health consequences of drug use in regions with a high concentration of injecting drug users, especially the Northeast and Punjab regions.  Over 213 centers in the country provide services to 22,510 injecting drug users of the total estimated 160,968-person population of people who inject drugs in India, according to NACO statistics.  In terms of broader drug use, an opioid dependence survey carried out in Punjab in 2015 found that of the state’s 28 million-person population, 230,000 people were opioid dependent and 860,000 were opioid users.  To better understand the national prevalence of drug abuse, MSJE and the National Drug Dependence Treatment Centre of the All India Institute of Medical Sciences  launched a survey to compile national and state-level estimates of the numbers of persons abusing drugs in July 2016.  The two-year-long survey, originally scheduled for release in late 2018, will map the presence of treatment and rehabilitation services for drug-dependent individuals and identify the gaps in service delivery.   4.  Corruption  Although the Government of India does not encourage or facilitate drug trafficking, national and local government officials have been implicated in drug-related corruption.  Official corruption has historically undermined the effectiveness of government control regimes for illicit drugs, and Indian media reports allege widespread official corruption, with bribes paid to rural police stations and local governance bodies to ignore illicit poppy and cannabis fields under their jurisdiction.  Corrupt border officials also enable the movement of heroin and precursor materials across the border.  For example, in October 2018, the Anti-Corruption Bureau arrested an opium inspector and a contracted computer data operator posted at NCB for allegedly taking bribes from local farmers.    C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  U.S.-Indian law enforcement cooperation led to numerous high-yield and high-value seizures throughout 2018.  NCB, DRI and DEA made joint arrests and seized significant amounts of narcotics.  U.S. and Indian law enforcement authorities also continue to target international drug organizations based in the United States and other locations with extensive ties to India.  Investigations have shown that Indian organizations have transferred proceeds from narcotics trafficking on behalf of multiple drug trafficking organizations.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 190  D.  Conclusion  India’s booming pharmaceutical and chemical industries are world leaders in pharmaceutical exports, particularly generic drugs.  However, the large industry is fragmented, insular, and in some ways, difficult to regulate.  Laws, regulations, and government enforcement have not kept adequate pace with the growth, and India is experiencing increased diversion from both licit pharmaceutical manufacturers and clandestine laboratories.    In 2018, Indian NCB and DRI worked closely and effectively with DEA and regional counterdrug partners in Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka, and the Maldives.  Through this regional cooperation, Indian officials were able to make or facilitate numerous arrests and seizures.  Further developing this relationship through intelligence sharing and cross training could lead to continued operational improvement.  This collaboration will be critical in 2019, as significant narcotics-related challenges facing the Indian government include growing production and trafficking of synthetic drugs such as fentanyl, as well as diversion of controlled substances from both licit and illicit channels; pharmaceutical smuggling from India to neighboring countries; and poor coordination among India’s drug enforcement agencies.   The profitability of manufacturing and distributing methamphetamine and other drugs has transformed India into a significant global source for precursor chemicals and drugs.  Global demand for fentanyl, methamphetamine, heroin, and other dangerous drugs has given rise to precursor chemical entrepreneurs in India who are retooling commercial chemical factories to illicitly produce large volumes of ephedrine, methamphetamine, and other drugs.  As global demand for synthetic drugs continues to grow, so too will India’s illicit manufacturing and trafficking networks.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 191  Indonesia  A.  Introduction  As a transshipment and destination point for illicit drugs, the Indonesian government struggles with the maritime interdiction and border control issues inherent in policing the more than 17,000 islands comprising its territory.  With the world’s fourth largest population, Indonesia is a significant consumer of cannabis, crystal methamphetamine, and MDMA (ecstasy).  Much of the methamphetamine available in Indonesia originates in China, Taiwan, or Burma.  MDMA is usually sourced from China, but also reaches Indonesia from the Netherlands, while cannabis is primarily grown in northern Sumatra for domestic consumption.  The Indonesian Government, including the National Narcotics Board of the Republic of Indonesia (BNN) and Indonesia National Police (INP), continued efforts to investigate, disrupt, interdict, and prosecute crimes related to illicit drugs in 2018, and some traffickers continued to receive the death penalty.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  Officers of BNN and INP continued to move aggressively against drug-trafficking suspects, and President Joko Widodo has called for strong enforcement measures to address the on-going drug emergency in Indonesia.  International non-governmental organizations periodically criticize excessive use of force in counterdrug operations.  On October 23, hundreds of residents attacked and burned a local police precinct building in Aceh following the suspicious death of a drug suspect, who was allegedly tortured while in police custody.  Four police were investigated for committing “procedural violations.”    BNN’s 2018 budget included funding prevention, eradication, and demand reduction programs.  According to BNN, each of the three deputies responsible for Prevention, Eradication, and Rehabilitation and Community Empowerment were provided equal funding.    BNN opened three new facilities to respond to narcotics supply and demand challenges: 1) a narcotics lab – the first of its kind in Indonesia – to address emerging issues related to new psychoactive substances; 2) a canine-unit training facility to increase drug interdictions at border areas and major entry points; and 3) a BNN community office pilot project in Surabaya to encourage the public to provide information and tips.  BNN also purchased new equipment, including x-rays and scanners, and located them at air and seaports known to be entry points for illicit drugs.  In an effort to disrupt a key drug smuggling route, BNN signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with PT (Pelabuhan Indonesia IV), a state owned enterprise that covers one of the biggest seaports in eastern Indonesia, Makassar Seaport.  Internationally, BNN also signed a MOU with the Kingdom of Morocco to share information involving illicit drug production and trade, evidence seizure, drug rehabilitation and research.  Indonesian authorities also continued to coordinate with partners on drug interdiction, including the United States and Taiwan.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 192   BNN reported that during the first 10 months of 2018, 111,000 individuals were incarcerated on drug-related charges, and more than half of those specifically for trafficking.  The United States provided counterdrug training for BNN and the INP, including for more than 45 law enforcement officers in February in Medan, North Sumatra.  Participants received training in financial analysis, internet investigations, graphic analysis, and cultivating confidential sources.  No mutual legal assistance treaty or extradition treaty exists between Indonesia and the United States.     2. Supply Reduction  BNN and INP continued to interdict illicit drugs successfully during 2018, and U.S. assistance proved helpful in this regard.  Indonesian law enforcement made a number of significant seizures during the year.  The largest, in February, was based on joint cooperation between BNN, INP, Indonesia Customs Narcotics Enforcement Team (CNET), Illegal Unreported and Unregulated Fishing (IUUF) Task Force, and U.S. authorities that resulted in an initial seizure of approximately 470 kilograms (kg) of crystal methamphetamine from a fishing vessel operated by a Taiwanese syndicate, followed two weeks later by the seizure of another 725 kg of crystal methamphetamine from a fishing vessel suspected of being operated by the same Taiwanese organization.  These seizures represent the largest Indonesian drug seizures to date.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  BNN did not publish any national surveys or research in 2018; the agency’s most recent drug research was published in December 2017.  According to the December 2017 research, an average of 30 people died daily within the country from overdoses.   Rehabilitative services are provided by the Indonesian government, but supply does not meet demand.  BNN is one of the government agencies that provides rehabilitative services, and has the capacity to offer treatment to up to 20,000 drug users annually.  However, Indonesia’s total drug-using population tops four million, according to BNN statistics.   4.  Corruption  The Indonesian government did not encourage or facilitate any illegal activity related to drug trafficking, and no senior government officials were known to be institutionally involved in any such activity.  However, corruption at all levels of government and society continues to be endemic, and undermines the country’s drug control efforts.  Nevertheless, Indonesia made some progress in 2018 in combating official corruption, primarily through the actions of the Corruption Eradication Commission.    C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  In 2018, the United States and Indonesia continue to follow through on most of the areas of bilateral drug demand reduction cooperation agreed upon in February 2016 at the U.S.-Indonesia Drug Demand Reduction Workshop in Jakarta.  In October, two Community Anti-Drug \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 193  Coalitions (in Jakarta and Surabaya) graduated from two-year training programs that give communities the skills to assess their own local drug problems, inventory the community’s resources, and execute unique solutions to address problems.   The United States is also working with the Indonesian Maritime Police and Maritime Security Agency to promote interagency collaboration and cooperation within Indonesia, and to build maritime patrol and interdiction capacity.   D.   Conclusion  Despite the efforts of the Indonesian government, demand for illicit drugs is believed to be growing in Indonesia.  Indonesia’s commitment to reducing drug consumption and enforcing its drug control laws remains firm.  The United States will continue to support Indonesian law enforcement efforts to disrupt the international drug trade, particularly in the maritime arena, while also helping Indonesia embrace a wide range of interventions aimed at reducing drug use and associated problems.        \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 194  Iran  Iran is a significant transit and destination country for opiates and cannabis products originating mostly in Afghanistan.  Significant volumes of methamphetamine are also produced and consumed within Iran, as well as trafficked to international markets.  Most opiates and cannabis products are trafficked into Iran across its land borders with Afghanistan and Pakistan.  Drug supplies transiting Iran are trafficked overland across Iran’s northern borders, primarily through Turkey and Azerbaijan, and to a lesser extent into Iraq.  Heroin and other opioids are also trafficked by maritime conveyance from Iran into Eastern Africa, for further transshipment to international markets.    Iran’s Drug Control Headquarters (DCHQ) is the country’s leading drug policy coordination body and reports directly to the country’s president.  The Law Enforcement Force (LEF) comprises the country’s uniformed police units, including the Anti-Narcotics Police and border interdiction forces.  According to media reports quoting DCHQ senior officials, Iranian authorities seized a total of 370 metric tons of all categories during the first five months of Iran’s lunar calendar in 2018 (March 21 – August 22).  During this period, seizures of heroin, morphine, and opium significantly outpaced what was seized during the same period in 2017 – by 17 percent, 58 percent, and 3 percent, respectively.      The Iranian government recognizes that illicit drug consumption within Iran is a serious challenge, and increasingly prevalent.  In 2018, DCHQ authorities estimated that 2.8 million people regularly use some form of illicit drug within the country, with half that total suffering from substance use disorders.  Other Iranian authorities and non-governmental organizations have cited higher estimates.  Opium is the most widely-used illicit drug in Iran, according to Iranian authorities, followed by cannabis products and methamphetamine (known locally as “shisheh,” or “glass”).  Approximately 43 percent of Iran’s inmate population is jailed for drug offenses, according to media reports.  Non-governmental organizations and the private sector implement the vast majority of demand reduction and treatment programs in the country, including opioid substitution treatment, voluntary counseling centers, prison-based treatment, and school-based prevention campaigns.   The UN Office on Drugs and Crime maintains a field office in Tehran that provides some training and capacity support to Iranian authorities, including on demand reduction, drug interdiction, and forensic analysis of drug seizures.  Iran maintains liaison relationships with some neighboring countries, but operational cooperation on investigations appears limited.  Drug control cooperation between Iran and European states has been limited partially due to concerns over the Iranian government’s widespread application of the death penalty for drug offenses.  In January 2018, the country’s strict trafficking laws were amended, raising the threshold that triggers the death penalty in drug possession cases.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 195  Jamaica  A.  Introduction   Jamaica remains the largest Caribbean source country of marijuana and a significant transit point for cocaine trafficked from South America to North America and other international markets.  Traffickers also export Jamaican-grown marijuana to other Caribbean countries in return for illicit firearms and other contraband.  Jamaica’s geographic position in the western Caribbean and its difficult-to-patrol coastline, high volume of tourist travel, and status as a major containerized cargo transshipment hub contribute to its use for drug trafficking via commercial shipping, small watercraft, air freight, human couriers, and private aircraft.  The U.S. and Jamaican governments continue to successfully utilize bilateral legal assistance and extradition treaties, as well as agreements on maritime law enforcement cooperation and sharing forfeited assets.  Additionally, the United States and Jamaica made progress in 2018 toward an agreement to formalize information sharing between customs agencies.    Jamaica’s drug control efforts face significant challenges from corruption, organized crime, gang activity, resource constraints, and an inefficient criminal justice system.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  Cooperation between the United States and Jamaica against illicit drugs and related transnational crime remains strong.  The U.S. government’s primary Jamaican partners are the Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF, police), the Jamaica Defense Force (military), the Jamaica Customs Agency, the Major Organized Crime and Anti-corruption Agency (MOCA), and the Financial Investigation Division of the Ministry of Finance.  Jamaica’s Caribbean Regional Drug Law Enforcement Training Center, housed at the JCF’s police college, provides counterdrug training to several regional partners.  The United States and Jamaica are bilateral parties to both a mutual legal assistance treaty and an extradition treaty.  The countries have a strong extradition and mutual assistance relationship, and both treaties were successfully used in 2018.  The United States and Jamaica also utilized a reciprocal agreement to share forfeited criminal assets and a bilateral agreement on law enforcement cooperation on maritime interdiction of illicit traffickers, including boarding of suspicious vessels and embarkation of law enforcement officials on the other country’s ships.  In 2018, the U.S. and Jamaican governments made some progress toward finalizing a bilateral customs mutual assistance agreement (CMAA).  The CMAA will provide a legal framework for the exchange of trade information between U.S. and Jamaican customs agencies, which in the long term will assist in targeting the flow of drugs, guns, and other contraband through U.S. and Jamaican ports of entry.  The CMAA is still under review by the Jamaican government and is not expected to be signed and in effect until 2019.  The Jamaican government ended in 2018 an existing non-binding memorandum of understanding previously used to share intercept \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 196  information, on the basis that it did not meet the legal framework required under the Jamaican constitution.  The absence of a formal agreement to share intercept information has hampered U.S. investigations in some areas.  The United States and Jamaica are currently in negotiations to find a way forward to reaching a mutually agreeable mechanism to restore this longstanding area of cooperation between both governments.     The Jamaica Defense Force Coast Guard is responsible for maritime law enforcement in Jamaica’s over 92,000 square mile maritime domain.  The Jamaican military purchased its first fixed-wing intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance aircraft, and held the launch ceremony on November 14, 2018.  Additionally, the Jamaican government has assigned a military officer to serve as a liaison at the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South in Key West, Florida, for coordination of operations against maritime traffickers.    Jamaica’s efforts to bring traffickers to justice are hobbled by an under-resourced, overburdened judicial system.  Repeated delays and trial postponements contribute to significant case backlogs; frustration among police, witnesses, jurors, and the public, and; impunity for many offenders.  In response, the Jamaican government passed a plea bargain reform bill in 2017, drafted with U.S. support and designed to incentivize plea bargaining to increase the courts’ efficiency and reduce the backlog of criminal cases.    2.  Supply Reduction  According to the JCF, authorities seized 63 kilograms (kg) of cocaine over the first nine months of 2018.  Jamaican authorities seized 658 kg during the same period in 2017.  In 2018, the JCF’s forces have been stretched thin by various state of emergency operations.  Significant cocaine seizures at or near the Port of Kingston have indicated that large shipments reached Jamaica via commercial shipping containers from South America.  Cocaine also arrives in Jamaica via small “go-fast” watercraft from Central and South America, likely with the assistance of larger fishing vessels that serve as mother ships.  After reaching Jamaica, some cocaine shipments are transshipped in containers through the Port of Kingston onto vessels bound for the United States and other international markets.  Other shipments enter the country and are divided into smaller quantities for outbound shipment via other means, including concealment in luggage, human couriers, air freight, or small watercraft.  In 2015, legislation to decriminalize the possession and use of small amounts of marijuana for personal use went into effect.  During the first nine months of 2018, Jamaican authorities eradicated 186 hectares (ha) of cannabis plants and seized approximately 20.2 metric tons of cured marijuana, according to police data.  Jamaican farmers cultivate an estimated 15,000 ha of cannabis every year.  The police, supported by the United States, employ an eradication team to cut growing plants, seize seedlings and cured marijuana, and burn them in the field.  The team conducts only manual eradication, since Jamaican law prohibits the use of herbicides.    Traffickers smuggle Jamaican-grown marijuana out of the country via commercial shipping and small watercraft.  Small fishing vessels and speed boats carry marijuana to Haiti, the Cayman Islands, and the Bahamas.  A thriving “guns for ganja (marijuana)” trade continues between \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 197  Jamaica and Haiti, as evidenced by seizures in 2018 of illegal firearms traced to Haiti and marijuana shipments prepared for embarkation from coastal Jamaica.  Police and customs officials also target marijuana shipments smuggled via commercial shipping directly to the United States.  Jamaica prohibits the manufacture, sale, transport, and possession of MDMA (ecstasy) and methamphetamine and regulates the precursor chemicals used to produce them.  There were no reports of synthetic drugs or precursor chemicals produced or trafficked in Jamaica in 2018.  The National Council on Drug Abuse, the Pharmacy Council, and the Ministry of Health work to expand awareness among health professionals of the potential for diversion of ephedrine and pseudoephedrine to produce methamphetamine.  U.S. law enforcement agencies work closely with Jamaican police and customs officials to develop leads, share information, and facilitate interdiction of drug shipments originating in or transiting through Jamaica.  The U.S. government has supported the Jamaican police’s Narcotics Division with equipment, including 17 donated vehicles and a training room, as well as training.     3.  Drug Abuse Awareness, Demand Reduction, and Treatment  The Ministry of Health’s National Council on Drug Abuse (NCDA), working through the primary care system and mental health clinics, provides assessment, counseling and treatment services for substance abusers.  The Jamaican government operates one detoxification center located at the University Hospital of the West Indies in Kingston and also offers services at Kingston’s Bellevue Hospital (a mental health institution).  In collaboration with the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, Jamaica offers a university-level certificate program in drug addiction and drug prevention.  The UN Office on Drugs and Crime works directly with the Jamaican government and non-governmental organizations on demand reduction.   4.  Corruption  As a matter of policy, the Jamaican government does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking or the laundering of proceeds from illicit drug transactions.  Jamaican law penalizes corruption, but in practice, corruption remains entrenched and widespread, and the judicial system has a poor record of prosecuting corruption cases against law enforcement and government officials.  The last time a Member of Parliament or similarly high-ranking official was tried or convicted on corruption charges was in 1990, when a former minister of labor was convicted for diverting money from a farm worker program for personal gain.  Corruption at Jamaica’s airports and seaports allegedly facilitates the movement of drug shipments across borders, and organized crime leaders have historically had ties to government officials, creating a permissive environment for drug trafficking.    In October 2018, the Jamaican government passed a bill to make MOCA, which investigates organized crime and official corruption, fully independent of the police.  MOCA was previously a task force within the JCF; the new legislation makes it a free-standing entity with its own \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 198  dedicated resources, potentially increasing its freedom to investigate corruption cases throughout the government.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The U.S. and Jamaican governments coordinate closely on shared priorities related to narcotics control, including investigative capacity, customs cooperation, maritime security, and support to the judicial system.   The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI support to Jamaica includes training, equipment, and logistical assistance for interdicting illicit drugs and firearms trafficking; combating cybercrime, money laundering, financial fraud, and other organized crime; improving Jamaica’s efforts to seize and forfeit criminally-acquired assets; and enhancing Jamaica’s maritime law enforcement capabilities.  The United States also funds projects to improve the effectiveness of prosecutors and the courts, the National Forensic Sciences Laboratory, and the Financial Investigation Division.    To increase public and government attention on the need for anticorruption reforms, the United States provides support to the non-governmental organization National Integrity Action (NIA).  NIA provides training to government, civil society, and media partners to increase awareness and conducts campaigns to increase public demand for more effective action against corruption.    The United States and Jamaica entered into a bilateral agreement to suppress maritime illicit trafficking in 1998.  This agreement includes provisions to stop, board, and search suspect vessels, the authority to overfly Jamaica’s territorial waters, the ability to order to land, and the use of third-party boarding platforms.  Jamaica is a regular participant in the Multilateral Maritime Interdiction and Prosecution Summits, which bring together maritime counter drug professionals from more than 20 countries across the Caribbean, Europe, and the United States.  D.  Conclusion  Cooperation between Jamaica and the United States related to drug trafficking and transnational crime continued to be strong in 2018, as evidenced by the high number of high-level extraditions of wanted criminals from the United States to Jamaica.    Progress against drug trafficking will significantly depend on efforts to combat corruption and strengthen the judicial system so traffickers are held criminally accountable.  New legislation to create an independent anticorruption investigation agency and U.S.-supported programs to weed out corrupt officials may represent a step forward in this regard.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 199  Kazakhstan  A.  Introduction  Kazakhstan is a transit country for Afghan heroin and other opiates destined for Russia and Europe.  Kazakhstan’s law enforcement agencies continued to report declining volumes of seizures of Afghan heroin in Kazakhstan in 2018, continuing a multi-year trend.  Official statistics were not available at the time of this report.  Kazakhstani authorities credited this reported decline to the Government of Kazakhstan’s effort to enhance border security in the south of the country, as well as a possible shift in trafficking patterns away from Central Asia in favor of routes through South Asia and the Balkans.  The U.S. government lacks sufficient information to corroborate these possible explanations.   Cultivation and trafficking of cannabis occurs within Kazakhstan, with most cannabis originating in the Zhambyl region on the southern border with the Kyrgyz Republic.  Law enforcement conducts operations to eradicate cultivation and interdict trafficking of cannabis within those areas of the country.  The Government of Kazakhstan has expressed growing concern about the use and trafficking of synthetic drugs within Kazakhstan, many of which are purchased via the internet and imported into the country from Russia, China, Southeast Asia, and Europe.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  The Government of Kazakhstan  pursues efforts to prevent drug addiction and combat drug trafficking as high priorities, and has integrated counterdrug activities into its National Security Strategy.  Kazakhstan implements drug demand reduction treatment projects in line with its national healthcare program for 2016-2019.   Kazakhstan embraces regional cooperation to counter drug trafficking, including by hosting of the Central Asia Regional Information Coordination Center for Combating Illicit Trafficking of Narcotic Drugs, Psychotropic Substances and their Precursors (CARICC).  The country’s law enforcement agencies use CARICC as a platform to exchange operational information on transnational drug trafficking in Central Asia.  The government cooperates with various multilateral organizations on drug control activities and policy discussions, including the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC); the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO); the Collective Security Treaty Organization (CSTO); the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS); and the Eurasian Group on Combating Money Laundering and Terrorism Financing.  Kazakhstan continues to provide training assistance to Afghanistan and other states in the region.  Cadets from Afghanistan, the Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan study at Kazakhstan’s Ministry of Internal Affairs and Border Guard Service academies.   In 2018, Kazakhstan’s law enforcement agencies participated in several counterdrug operations and exercises under a CSTO regional umbrella operation called “Kanal” (Channel).  Kazakhstan hosted two operations under this initiative, in May and September, respectively.  In cooperation with UNODC, Kazakhstan also implemented five capacity building projects to counter illicit \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 200  trafficking of narcotics, psychotropic substances and their precursors in Central Asia and other neighboring countries.  SCO members adopted an Anti-Narcotics Strategy for 2018-2023, an action plan for its implementation, and a “concept of prevention of abuse of narcotics and psychotropic substances.”     In 2016, Kazakhstan developed draft legislation that would allow scheduling of potentially dangerous psychoactive substances as analogues of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances, including on an emergency basis.  The law still awaits approval by Kazakhstan’s parliament.        2.  Supply Reduction  During the first nine months of 2018, Kazakhstan’s law enforcement agencies reported detecting 6,516 criminal drug-related offences, including 2,147 drug-related crimes, 1,446 illicit drug sales, and 172 instances of drug smuggling.  Law enforcement agencies reported conducting six controlled delivery operations that resulted in the seizure of 16.5 kilograms (kg) of illicit drugs.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) reported disrupting nine drug trafficking organizations, initiating 15 criminal cases targeting organized criminal groups, and initiating 12 cases targeting illicit drug sales.  Law enforcement reported seizing 18.9 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs in total (down from 38.5 MT during the same period in 2017), including 55.3 kg of heroin (126.6 kg in 2017); 740 kg of hashish (439.6 kg in 2017); 7.4 kg of opium; and 16.4 MT of marijuana (32.3 MT in 2017).   Kazakhstan conducted its annual cannabis eradication operation from May 20 through October 20.  During the first nine months of 2018, the MVD reported detecting 1,571 internet sites involved in illicit drug sales, and the Ministry of Information and Communications blocked 1,446 of those sites.  Another 125 sites are still under review.       The MVD reported seizing approximately 1.8 kg of synthetic drugs in 2018, including 1.2 kg of pyrovalerone, 856 grams of fentanyl, and 23.8 grams of methylmethcathinone.  The relatively small synthetic drug seizure totals may not accurately reflect the true scale of trafficking within the country.  Kazakhstani agencies have limited forensic capacity to identify new psychoactive substances, and the country’s current legislation does not criminalize analogue substances.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  The MVD Counternarcotics Department cooperates with 73 non-governmental organizations (NGOs) on drug demand reduction activities and the medical and social rehabilitation of persons suffering from substance abuse disorders.  New narcology standards, treatment methods, prison addict rehabilitation, and harm reduction programs are in development, but remain antiquated.   The Counternarcotics Department worked with the Ministry of Health, the Ministry of Education and Science, and NGOs to conduct 6,453 drug demand reduction events in 2018, reaching over 333,000 youth.  The government also introduced a new program in schools to assist with early diagnosis of drug use.  A drug use prevention project initiated by the MVD and the Ministry of Education and Science called “Young Police Assistants” has reached 55,000 school children.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 201  The government reported 23,105 registered drug users in 2018, including 1,704 women and 126 minors.   4.  Corruption  The Government of Kazakhstan does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  However, there are instances of corruption among law enforcement agencies, particularly among front line law enforcement officers, whose low salaries incentivize bribe requests.  The government rewards citizens for reporting police corruption  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  Kazakhstan is committed to advancing its drug demand and supply reduction goals and strengthening international cooperation in these fields.  To reduce the illicit inflow of drugs, Kazakhstan plans to revise its border procedures for foreign nationals, especially from countries identified as illicit drug trafficking threats.  The government is also developing measures to identify and combat maritime trafficking channels.    The United States continues to support drug control capacity building with relevant authorities.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the MVD in November 2016 to support bilateral drug control efforts and information sharing, allowing a closer relationship, information sharing, and joint operations.  DEA also signed an MOU with Committee for National Security of the Republic of Kazakhstan (KNB) on June 27, 2018, which yielded fruitful cooperation over the course of the year.  The United States supports efforts to strengthen Kazakhstan’s border security, including efforts to expand Kazakhstan’s Coast Guard capacity on the Caspian Sea.  In 2018, the United States organized 36 training programs for Kazakhstani drug enforcement officers.  All U.S. government programs aim to improve Kazakhstan’s capacity to combat drug trafficking and drug demand, and enjoy full host government support and shared funding.    D.  Conclusion  Kazakhstan remains concerned about regional drug trafficking trends linked to illicit drug production in Afghanistan.  To confront the increasing synthetic drug threat, Kazakhstan should work to finalize and adopt its pending legislation that would allow it to schedule narcotic analogues for control, including on an emergency basis, a step that will greatly enhance its ability to counter this threat.  The government is seeking to expand its drug control cooperation with international partners, especially the United States, and is also taking steps to combat existing and emerging public health and national security threats posed by drug trafficking and addiction.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 202  Kenya  Kenya is a significant transshipment route for illicit drugs destined for other international markets, and, to a lesser extent, a consumer country of illicit drugs.  Transnational criminal organizations that transship drugs through Kenya also engage in a wide range of additional criminal activity, including corruption, money laundering and wildlife trafficking.  Drug trafficking organizations utilize Kenya as a transshipment point for heroin and to a lesser extent, cocaine and methamphetamine.  The most commonly used illicit drug by Kenyan adults is cannabis, followed by heroin and diverted pharmaceutical drugs.  The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances (Control) Act of 1994 and its various amendments provide the basis for drug law enforcement within Kenya.  Criminal asset forfeiture laws are also in place allowing for the seizure and forfeiture of proceeds from drug trafficking, as well as assets used in furtherance of such crimes.  The Anti-Narcotic Units of the Kenya Police Service enforce narcotics laws throughout the country, while other law enforcement agencies frequently assist in drug enforcement matters.    The importation of heroin into Kenya is a major focus of law enforcement authorities.  This criminal activity brings with it a multitude of other threats, including corruption and increased local use of the drug.  Although heroin is used throughout Kenya, consumption is most prevalent along the coastal area surrounding Mombasa.  Heroin enters Kenya both through maritime smuggling and over land borders, primarily in the south of Kenya.  Cocaine frequently transits Kenya, primarily by couriers traveling commercial airlines.  Although a majority of the cocaine is destined for other markets, there is evidence of local cocaine trafficking and consumption.    The United States and Kenya enjoy an excellent bilateral relationship and fully cooperate on multilateral drug enforcement efforts.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration works closely with Kenya to target national and international drug trafficking organizations.  In turn, Kenyan counternarcotics law enforcement authorities also liaise with their counterparts in neighboring countries and throughout the region, fostering a coordinated multinational approach in targeting transnational criminal organizations.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 203   Laos   A.  Introduction    Laos is a major drug source country of illicit opium cultivation, and a significant transit hub and consumer of other illicit drugs, particularly amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS).  Most of the opium grown in Laos is destined for export and refinement into heroin, with only a small percentage consumed in Laos.  Laos is not a significant source of opiates being sent to the United States.  ATS production within Laos appears to be limited but increasing, and seizure data indicates that ATS trafficking into Laos from neighboring countries is increasing, fueling rising drug use within the country.  Laos shares approximately 3,000 miles of porous land and riverine borders with Burma, Thailand, China, Cambodia, and Vietnam.  Although infrastructure remains rudimentary, improving road, bridge, and communication networks in Laos have increased opportunities for drug trafficking.  Poppy cultivation in Laos decreased 96 percent between 1998 and 2007 due to aggressive government action and international cooperation, particularly U.S. alternative development assistance.  Although significant amounts of opium poppy are still grown in Laos, often in remote and difficult to access areas, overall cultivation appears to have been relatively stable in recent years, if not declining marginally.  According to the most recent UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) Laos Opium Survey, Laos cultivated an estimated 6,200 hectares (ha) of opium poppy in 2014 and 5,700 ha in 2015.  The most recent available data, from a survey completed by Lao and Chinese technical staff, found 5,328 ha of opium poppy in 2017.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development   Since 1989, the United States has provided Laos approximately $47 million in law enforcement and drug control assistance, which helped to eliminate much of Laos’ opium poppy cultivation.  The Lao Bureau for Drug Control and Supervision (LBDC) and the Counternarcotics Police Department (DCD), both under the Ministry of Public Security, are the main coordinating bodies for the implementation of drug demand reduction, crop control, alternative development, and law enforcement activities.  The top policy-making body for drug control is the National Steering Committee to Combat Drugs (NSCCD), chaired by the Prime Minister.  Lao drug police are organized into 18 provincial counterdrug police divisions known as Counter Narcotics Units (CNUs), one for each province and Vientiane Capital.    Laos does not have a bilateral extradition or a mutual legal assistance agreement with the United States, though Laos has acceded to multilateral conventions that enable such cooperation.  While the Lao are receptive to training opportunities, bilateral cooperation with the United States on international drug trafficking investigations has been rare to date.   2.  Supply Reduction \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 204    Lao drug control authorities have increased their cooperation over the past several years on border control and interdiction with counterparts in neighboring countries.  In January 2017, Laos joined other ASEAN Member States in adopting the ASEAN Cooperation Plan to Tackle Illicit Drug Production and Trafficking in the Golden Triangle (2017-2019).  The Plan is a concerted effort to solve drug problems in the Golden Triangle, and builds on both the Safe Mekong Joint Operation Project, which began in 2013, and the ASEAN Work Plan on Securing Communities Against Illicit Drugs (2016-2025).  In October 2018, Laos took over hosting the Safe Mekong Coordination Center and will play the role of host until January 2019.  The Safe Mekong Operation Project on Drug Control is specifically focused on disrupting the flow of drugs out of the Golden Triangle and intercepting the flow of chemical precursors into the Golden Triangle.  The Safe Mekong initiative partner countries are China, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, and Cambodia.   Several Lao drug traffickers were arrested and sentenced in 2017-18.  Lao national Xaysana Keophimpha was arrested at Suvarnabhumi airport in Bangkok in January 2017 and sentenced to life in prison in Thailand in March 2018.  Several of his associates have also been arrested, including Sisouk Daoheuang (arrested in Laos) and Akarakit Worarojcharoendet (arrested in Thailand), and have been sentenced to lengthy prison terms or are awaiting sentencing.  During the first six months of 2018, the DCD reportedly seized 71.13 kilograms (kg) of heroin; 53.36 kg of opium; 5.9 kg of cannabis; 102.83 kilogram (kg) of crystal methamphetamine; 1,775,360 ATS tablets (weighing 260.53 kg), and 25.9 kg of precursor chemicals.  The DCD investigated 2,947 drug cases and arrested 4,404 people, including 110 foreign nationals.  Statistics for the second half of the year were not available at the time of this report.  The Lao government also continues to support longstanding efforts to assist former poppy-growing farmers by fostering alternative livelihoods, mostly financed by donors.  In 2016, the U.S. government launched a three-year, $1.5 million alternative development program with the UNODC in Houaphan province.  The project focus includes the development of coffee plantations and improved technology for livestock production.  In 2018, the U.S. government signed a new $1.225 million Letter of Agreement (LOA) with the Lao Department of Customs focused on improving border security and disrupting the flow of illicit substances into Laos.  The U.S. government has an existing LOA with the Ministry of Public Security’s Counternarcotics Police Division and capacity building trainings with Lao CNUs are ongoing.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   The current Lao government, led by Prime Minister Thongloun Sisoulith, has made combating illicit drugs a top priority, and the Lao government has increased efforts to raise awareness of the risks and negative consequences of illicit drugs through mass media such as television, radio, newspaper, and other channels.  ATS use is thought to be concentrated among Laos' youth population, mostly consumed as “yaba,” a mixture of methamphetamine and caffeine that is popular throughout Southeast Asia.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 205  The Lao Government uses an estimate of 40,000 consumers, although this figure is likely an underestimate.    Government drug treatment facilities lack the resources to provide evidence-based treatment and post-discharge follow-up.  To support demand reduction efforts, the United States supports the adoption of community-based, voluntary treatment.  The United States has provided approximately $600,000 to the UNODC and the World Health Organization to establish and operate 28 Community-Based Treatment centers providing screening and counseling services at district hospitals across six provinces.  The United States is also funding the translation and training for Lao National Trainers on the U.S.-developed Universal Prevention Curriculum and Universal Treatment Curriculum, with the Colombo Plan and UNODC as the implementers.   4.  Corruption   The Lao government does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of narcotic or other controlled substances, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  However, salaries for police, military and civil servants are low, and corruption in Laos is endemic.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   The Lao government’s guiding drug control strategy document, the “National Drug Control Master Plan 2016-2020,” was approved in May 2016.  The Master Plan, which was developed with support from the United States and the UNODC, articulates nine priorities for the Lao government, including:  •         Formulation and improvement of legal instruments concerning narcotic; •         Data/Information collection and analysis; •         Education/Training/Dissemination of the laws and adverse consequences      resulting from drug abuse; •         Treatment and vocational training for drug addicts; •         Alternative development, replacing opium poppy and cannabis cultivation; •         Law enforcement; •         Precursor control, analysis and test of drug use; •         International cooperation; and •         Streamlining the organizational machinery of the national commission for     drug control and supervision at the central and local levels.  The Master Plan implements the country’s National Drug Law (promulgated in 2015), and calls for a budget of $18 million over five years from 2016-2020.  Funds for implementing the plan are expected to come from the Lao government and international donors.    The United States supports Laos’ goal to strengthen the rule of law by 2020 and to create a better environment for combating transnational crime.  Most U.S. counterdrug assistance to Laos supports law enforcement efforts, including training for the DCD, CNUs, and Customs Department. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 206    D.  Conclusion   Drug control cooperation between Laos and the United States is increasing and continues to emphasize border security and improved law enforcement capacity.  Drug trafficking networks across Southeast Asia ignore national borders, requiring strong regional law enforcement capacity and cooperation.  Laos’ justice, law enforcement, and security systems lack the resources necessary to counter the increased sophistication of drug-related crime that has accompanied the country’s growing economic development.  Continued support for institution building within the Lao government as well as basic law enforcement training, emphasizing interdiction, investigation, and prosecution, remains needed.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 207  Liberia  A.  Introduction  While Liberia is not a significant transit country for illicit narcotics, the country’s nascent law enforcement capacity, porous border controls, and proximity to major drug transit routes contribute to trafficking to and through Liberia.  While Liberia is also not a significant producer of illicit drugs, local drug use is very common.  There is no reliable data on drug consumption trends within Liberia because of poor transportation and communications infrastructure, and a lack of capacity within the Government of Liberia to undertake the necessary research.  However, a recent U.S.-administered survey of Liberian youth found that marijuana, tramadol, and methamphetamine are the drugs of choice.  Other drug usage includes heroin (mostly smoked) and cocaine (snorted).  Local authorities have reported an increased prevalence of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and intravenous drugs.  Other than marijuana, locally consumed drugs enter Liberia via commercial aircraft, maritime vessels, and across land borders by foot and vehicle traffic.  Drug use among the country’s youth population is a growing public concern.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development   Local law enforcement agencies, including the Liberia National Police (LNP), Coast Guard, National Security Agency, and the Liberian Drug Enforcement Agency (LDEA), work in concert to fight drug trafficking in Liberia.  Established Nigerian criminal networks operate within Liberia, some of which traffic drugs.  Local authorities are aware of the threat and are working with the United States and other international partners to prevent illicit criminal networks from gaining a stronger foothold.    During 2018, the LDEA made a number of interdictions and arrests of drug traffickers based upon intelligence and international cooperation.  Drug seizures have increased from a few grams of drugs on a single user to multi-kilogram seizures and arrests of international drug traffickers.  This is a significant change, as prior to 2013, the LDEA did not have the capacity to perform the basic investigations and surveillance necessary to obtain warrants, maintain chain of custody, and present a proper case in court.   Since 2014, when the LDEA Act and a Controlled Drugs and Substances Act came into effect, Liberian pursuit and prosecution of drug trafficking has increased.  In 2015, 107 individuals were arrested under the new Anti-Drug Law with seven indictments; in 2016, there were 70 arrests with 24 indictments leading to 20 prosecutions.  In 2017, there were 88 arrests with 11 indictments and 10 prosecutions, leading to a cumulative total of 76 years of imprisonment.  During the first 10 months of 2018, there were 83 arrests with nine indictments and four prosecutions.  The decline in indictments and prosecutions in 2018 can be attributed to the December 2017 election of a new President who spent several months staffing his administration.  Notably, in December of 2016, the LDEA facilitated the transfer and arrest of a Pakistani heroin dealer wanted by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, which resulted in \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 208  in his conviction in a U.S. court in May 2018.  Many of the effective interdictions and seizures during 2018 came about because of LDEA’s increased cooperation with international partners, which has led to greater intelligence sharing and capacity to collect and act on intelligence.  The LDEA continues to improve its operational capacity and professionalism, with such activities as using confidential sources; working with private businesses; initiating controlled deliveries; investigating international smuggling groups; and effectively working across Liberian government agencies.  The U.S.-Liberia extradition treaty dates from 1939 and is in effect, and while no mutual legal assistance treaty between Liberia and the United States exists, Liberia is a party to multilateral conventions that enable such cooperation.   2.  Supply Reduction    Local marijuana production is not seen as a major concern by the public, and while there is little information on the extent of local cannabis cultivation, or the local sales networks, marijuana is clearly the most widely available drug in the country.  In 2018, the LDEA seized a total of approximately 4.5 metric tons (MT) of marijuana, 4.8 kilograms (kg) of cocaine, 12.5 kg of heroin, and 6 kg of methamphetamine (a new class of illicit drugs just seen in Liberia over the past two years).  Also in 2018, the LDEA made significant progress in its fight to counter international drug trafficking through air couriers, and successfully interdicted six foreign nationals and seized 267 kg of khat (a traditional stimulant used in Northern Africa and the Arabian Peninsula), four kg of heroin, and two kg of cocaine at Roberts International Airport.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment    Due to a lack of resources and capacity, the government has conducted very little drug prevention, rehabilitation or treatment since the 1970’s (pre-civil war), with persons with substance use disorders being referred to the only psychiatric hospital in Liberia or to one of the few non-governmental organizations (NGOs) working in the field.  A bright spot was on June 26, when the LDEA hosted International Day Against Illicit Drugs-World Drug Day, logistically supported by the United States, which achieved the largest public turnout for this annual event since it was first held in 2003.  The event promoted drug demand reduction and community engagement in fighting drug abuse, underscored various enforcement efforts, and highlighted Liberian inter-agency security cooperation to combat drug trafficking and transnational crime.  The 2018 event culminated in the public destruction (burning) of seized drugs, an action widely covered in the media as it demonstrated a new level of transparency.  The LDEA destroyed 4.38 MT of marijuana, 4.9 kg of cocaine and 12.3 kg of heroin at this event.   4.  Corruption   The Government of Liberia does not encourage or facilitate the production or distribution of illicit drugs, nor the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions, as a matter of policy.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 209  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States is working with the Government of Liberia to fight international drug trafficking and reduce local demand.  Among ongoing initiatives, the United States is funding a $2.4 million project through the U.N Office on Drugs and Crime to enhance the capacities of Liberian law enforcement agencies to counter transnational crime and trafficking of drugs and other contraband.   While these efforts continue, U.S. assistance seeks to build the Government of Liberia’s capacity to develop criminal cases against international trafficking organizations active in the country, and encourage judicial application and attorney understanding of anti-drug laws.  Many of the seizures and successful cases recorded in 2018 are a direct result of international cooperation in countering international drug trafficking.   D.  Conclusion  The Government of Liberia is committed to preventing transnational criminal organizations from gaining a major foothold in its territory, but lacks the resources and capacity to respond adequately to this challenge.  Despite significant constraints, the LDEA is also working with other regional drug enforcement entities to exchange intelligence and information – collaboration that has led to the interdiction of international traffickers within Liberia's borders.  After four years of effort to overcome institutional and political resistance, the LDEA has deployed to all the Liberian Ports of Entry, and given the advancements in LDEA capacity, judicial acceptance, and successful prosecutions, it is anticipated that 2019 will see significant results.  The United States will continue to support and assist Liberia’s efforts to strengthen its law enforcement capacities and fulfill its international drug control commitments.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 210  Malaysia  Malaysia is not a significant source country or transit point for U.S.-bound illicit drugs.  Nevertheless, trafficking through Malaysia to supply international markets continues and transnational criminal organizations are attempting to expand crystal methamphetamine production within the country.  Drugs smuggled into Malaysia include marijuana, heroin, and amphetamine-type stimulants.  Synthetic drugs are also trafficked through Malaysia, including MDMA (ecstasy), nimetazepam (a diverted pharmaceutical drug), and crystal methamphetamine.  There is no notable cultivation of illicit drug crops in Malaysia and local demand and consumption for illicit drugs is limited.   Although the Royal Malaysian Police are generally effective in arresting drug offenders, Malaysian prosecutors have shown limited success in prosecuting and convicting drug traffickers as Malaysia does not have an effective drug conspiracy law.  Coupled with the high burden of proof required for a drug trafficking conviction, which in many cases leads to a mandatory death sentence, prosecutors are limited in their ability to charge and prosecute such cases.  The new Prime Minister, elected in May 2018, is seeking to abolish the death penalty in Malaysia, and currently has support in Parliament for the measure.  Drug trafficking through Malaysia in 2018 remained relatively consistent with previous years.  Overall, Malaysian authorities seized approximately $23 million worth of drugs in the first half of 2018, according to the latest Malaysian government statistics available, which is a 17 percent decrease from the same time period last year.  Arrests for supplying and possessing drugs decreased 2 percent and 5 percent, respectively, compared to the first half of 2018, while arrests for drug use, based on urinalysis, fell by 27 percent.    Malaysia has an extradition treaty and mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States and is generally cooperative in these cases.  The United States continues to send Malaysian police for counter-drug training at the International Law Enforcement Academy in Bangkok.  The U.S. Coast Guard continued its maritime law enforcement training program with the Malaysian Maritime Enforcement Agency.  In 2019, the United States will seek to promote further coordination between Malaysian and U.S. law enforcement authorities, including joint interdiction efforts, information sharing, and training to further improve Malaysia's investigative and prosecutorial capacity.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 211  Mali  Mali is a transit point for illicit drugs trafficked mostly to Europe.  Instability and lawlessness stemming from the ongoing violent extremist conflict in Central and Northern Mali pose challenges to the government’s modest drug interdiction efforts, while offering the violent extremists a source of revenue by providing protection for illicit shipments.  Senior officials have requested international assistance in both interdiction and in combatting the growing domestic use of illicit drugs in the country.     The Ministry of Security has a dedicated office for drug control, the interagency Central Narcotics Office, with approximately 140 officers, detailed from the Police, Immigration, Gendarmes and Customs services.  Although the ministry maintains a number of international liaison relationships, regional drug control cooperation is virtually non-existent.     Drug trafficking is concentrated along the southern and western Malian borders.  Mali’s 4,500 miles of borders are mostly unpatrolled, and the movement of almost all goods is unregulated.  Illicit drugs have also been trafficked through the country by aerial conveyance, though on a lesser scale.   There is a growing concern from Mali’s government and traditional and religious leaders over the growing use of illicit drugs among the population, primarily among young people.  Consumption of methamphetamine, flunitrazepam, and the synthetic opioid tramadol is growing, fueled by high employment and low costs.   Corruption among counterdrug officials is a concern, and the United States supports a number of on-going security and governance programs to address this matter.    Mali and the United States share common goals of reducing the use and traffic of illicit drugs, and in denying violent extremists access to revenue from the sale of such contraband.  The United States is increasing its efforts to work with Mali to combat the illicit flow of drugs through the country, as well as work with the government on domestic efforts to reduce demand for dangerous drugs.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 212  Mexico  A.  Introduction  Mexico is a significant source and transit country for heroin, marijuana, and synthetic drugs destined for the United States and a main transit country for cocaine from South America.  Mexico is a source of illicit opium poppy and believed to be the primary source of heroin to the U.S. domestic market.  Mexico is also a main transit route for fentanyl originating from China.  Drug trafficking and its related violence and corruption in Mexico pose considerable problems to citizen security and economic development.  According to the Mexican government, murders increased 19 percent nationally (to 27 murders per 100,000 residents) during the first eight months of 2018 compared to the same period in 2017.    The Merida Initiative is the U.S. government’s primary mechanism to implement civilian security assistance in Mexico.  Merida Initiative projects disrupt transnational criminal organizations and hinder their ability to produce and traffic drugs to the United States.  Assistance includes training and equipment to dismantle clandestine drug labs; a poppy eradication tracking program; advanced airport security technology; inspection equipment for border crossings and checkpoints; and reconnaissance technologies to improve maritime interdiction.  The United States also provides security assistance for drug interdiction equipment and training to military and law enforcement personnel.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1.  Institutional Development  On July 1, Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador of the National Regeneration Movement party (MORENA) won Mexico’s presidential election with 53 percent of the vote.  The new administration has expressed a commitment to reducing crime and violence, including through the creation of a new Public Security Ministry, increased investigation and prosecution of financial crimes, and cannabis legalization and regulation as a purported crime-reduction measure.  Mexico’s 2018 federal budget for justice and national and domestic security increased 6.2 percent compared to 2017.    Mexico is party to several legal agreements relevant to drug control, including the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters, the 1996 Anti-Drug Strategy, and the 1990 Ixtapa Declaration and Program of Action.  Mexico is a regional observer in the Central American Integration System and participates with Canada and the United States in the North American Maritime Security Initiative to share information, improve response to transnational threats, and develop protocols for maritime interdictions.  Mexico participates with the United States and Canada in the North American Dialogue on Drug Policy.  The current U.S.-Mexico extradition treaty has been in force since 1980, and Mexico remains one of the United States’ strongest extradition partners.  Moreover, a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty in force since 1991 fosters a broad range of cooperation in criminal matters.    2.  Supply Reduction \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 213   The U.S. government estimates opium poppy cultivation in Mexico reached 44,100 hectares (ha) in 2017, an increase from 32,000 ha in 2016.  Most poppy cultivation occurred in the states of Sinaloa, Chihuahua, Durango, and Guerrero.  A team from the Mexican Attorney General’s Office (PGR), Army (SEDENA), Navy (SEMAR), Foreign Ministry (SRE), and the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is working on a new opium yield study with the support of the U.S. government to estimate heroin production.  The United States is supporting the project with equipment donations and is collaborating closely with the Mexican government to use the yield study data to establish mutually agreed upon production estimates.  PGR’s National Center for Planning, Analysis, and Information to Combat Organized Crime (PGR/CENAPI) publishes drug eradication and seizure statistics for civilian law enforcement agencies.  According to PGR/CENAPI, in calendar year 2017, Mexico eradicated 4,231 ha of marijuana and 29,207 ha of opium poppy.  During the first six months of 2018, Mexico eradicated 1,162 ha of cannabis and 17,288 ha of opium poppy.  In calendar year 2017, Mexico reportedly seized approximately 12.6 MT of cocaine; 416 MT of marijuana; 34,841 cannabis fields; 766.9 kilograms (kg) of opium gum; 202,279 poppy fields; 11.3 MT of methamphetamine; 356 kg of heroin; and 103 clandestine laboratories.  During the first six months of 2018, Mexico reportedly seized approximately 5.53 MT of cocaine; 110.7 MT of marijuana; 16,267 cannabis fields; 38.5 kg of opium gum; 149,357 poppy fields; 6.3 MT of methamphetamine; 316 kg of heroin; and 37 clandestine laboratories.    The United States supports SEMAR, SEDENA, the Federal Police, Customs (SAT), and PGR with intelligence, training, and specialized equipment.  In August, SEMAR seized and destroyed more than 130 MT of processed methamphetamine and more than 29,000 liters and 10,000 kg of precursor chemicals from multiple clandestine laboratories and underground storage facilities in Sinaloa and Durango.  SEMAR used equipment and training provided by DEA under the Merida Initiative to handle and destroy the chemicals on site.    Since January 2018, SEMAR has seen a significant increase in maritime seizures, capturing 11.4 MT of cocaine, almost all of it in the Eastern Pacific.  The U.S. government supported the seizures through information-sharing and foreign assistance efforts, including four CASA 235 aircraft with U.S.-managed intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) upgrades.  The ISR-enabled video systems will generate inalterable aerial footage, making it a possible source of evidence for use in court proceedings.  The United States recently completed upgrades to four SEMAR Maritime Patrol Aircraft, and is supporting SEMAR interdiction and information gathering efforts.    During the first nine months of 2018, U.S. Customs and Border Protection seized 151 kg of fentanyl at U.S. southwest border ports of entry.  In April, officials in Tijuana seized 361 small fentanyl packets that had been prepared for street-level distribution.  In August, a Merida-donated canine team discovered 2.6 kg of fentanyl pills and 1.1 kg of crystal methamphetamine during an inspection at a commercial shipping office in Jalisco.  In September, Baja California State Police uncovered a suspected carfentanil pill production mill (carfentanil is a fentanyl analogue and up to100 times as potent).  At the site, police found precursor chemicals and a kilogram of suspected carfentanil.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 214   Canines donated through the Merida Initiative to Mexico made significant seizures of illicit drugs in 2018, including fentanyl.  In May, Merida-donated canines discovered 25 liters of chemical precursor and 450 liters of hydrochloric acid at parcel companies in Durango and Guadalajara.  In July, a Merida-donated canine team located 1,280 liters of sulfuric acid at a parcel company in Guadalajara, and 4.9 kg of methamphetamine during an inspection in Michoacan.    In 2018, Mexican officials consolidated oversight of counterdrug efforts under a new Office of National Drug Policy (ONPD) within PGR.    3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  In 2018, Mexico’s National Commission Against Addictions (CONADIC) released official results from a national survey of drug, alcohol, and tobacco usage.  The study showed overall marijuana use at 8.6 percent (up from 6 percent in 2011); stable cocaine use at 3.5 percent; inhalants at 1.1 percent; and amphetamine-type stimulants at 0.9 percent.  There was no indication of domestic fentanyl use in Mexico.    The United States supports the implementation of court-supervised treatment for criminal offenders with drug use problems in Mexico.  Currently, six Mexican states operate 30 drug treatment courts including six juvenile courts, all of which receive training and assistance from the Merida Initiative to facilitate court-supervised drug treatment and social reinsertion.  4.  Corruption  As a matter of government policy, Mexico does not encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  Nevertheless, corruption continues to impede Mexican drug control efforts.  Mexico’s National Anti-Corruption System seeks to address impunity for corruption, but implementation is not yet complete.  The Senate has not yet appointed a special anticorruption prosecutor or approved the selection of the 18 administrative judges charged with ruling on corruption cases.    A joint working group between the new Lopez Obrador administration and civil society is devoted to transforming the PGR into a new Fiscalia General de la Republica, which would make the Attorney General’s Office autonomous from the Presidency.  In September, MORENA submitted a bill to congress that would allot one year for the transition from PGR to the new Fiscalia to begin, with 2022 as the completion date for the transition.    A number of high-ranking government officials faced corruption-related charges in 2018, including five former governors currently in custody on pre-trial detention.  A sixth, former Veracruz Governor Javier Duarte, pleaded guilty to criminal association and money laundering charges in September and received a sentence of nine years.  Federal and state authorities have opened corruption investigations into former Governor of Nayarit Roberto Sandoval and former Governor of Veracruz Flavino Rios.  In total, nearly 20 former governors have been sentenced, face corruption charges, or are under formal investigation. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 215   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The Merida Initiative is the primary driver of bilateral security cooperation, and it plays a key role in addressing the U.S. opioid epidemic through its efforts to stop illicit opioids from being produced in Mexico and trafficked into the United States.  The U.S. government works closely with multiple federal and state agencies of the Mexican government on fentanyl detection and seizure.  The Merida Initiative supports training for Mexico’s fentanyl response teams and for canines and handlers on fentanyl detection; gas chromatography machines for the PGR forensics laboratory to test unknown drug samples; and non-intrusive inspection equipment to help interdict the transportation of fentanyl and other illicit items.    In February 2018, experts from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), with funding from the Merida Initiative, provided canine fentanyl detection training in Mexico City.  RCMP trained canine teams from the Federal Police and SAT; subsequent training in October focused on SEDENA and PGR canine programs.  In July, the Nogales Border Patrol Station and the Consulate General Nogales’ Regional Security Office conducted a fentanyl class for 34 Mexican law enforcement officials, including federal and state police and customs officials.  In August, DEA opioid and synthetic drug experts provided fentanyl awareness and processing procedures training to 70 officers of the Sonora State Police.    As of August, the Government of Mexico had deployed a U.S.-funded biometric data sharing program  in all of its 52 migration processing stations.  The program supports Mexico’s ability to detect threats and has vastly improved Mexico’s capability to partner with U.S. law enforcement to dismantle transnational criminal organizations and impove border control.  As of October, authorities had identified hundreds of gang members and drug traffickers.  In Mexico City, the bilateral Drug Policy Working Group has taken the lead to operationalize agreements reached at the 2017 cabinet-level meetings of the “Strategic Dialogue on Disrupting Transnational Criminal Organizations” and the “Security Cooperation Group” (a sub-cabinet group with participants from more than 20 U.S. and Mexican federal agencies).  The working group met for the fourth time in January 2018, headed by the Embassy Mexico City’s Deputy Chief of Mission and PGR.  The group focuses on implementing projects to diminish illicit drug production, enhance interdiction efforts, and share best practices to respond to drug demand in both countries.  D.  Conclusion  Drug trafficking, corruption, and related violence remain substantial challenges for citizen security in Mexico.  The United States will continue to look for opportunities to enhance bilateral cooperation and work toward achieving shared goals through effective targeting of transnational criminal networks, opium poppy eradication, improved interdiction of illicit drugs, and cooperation against money laundering in both countries.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 216  Morocco  Morocco is one of the top cannabis and hashish-producing countries of the world, with Europe being a primary market.  Traffickers may be decreasing the use of commercialized containers for smuggling activity due to the deployment of x-ray scanners at the port of Tangier, and increasing the use of “go-fast” boats and non-commercial airplanes to smuggle drugs into Spain.  Traffickers may also be expanding internal routes by moving hashish south and then to Morocco’s coast for non-commercial maritime shipment to Europe or overland shipment to African markets.  Moroccan hashish is also smuggled south into Mauritania, and then moved east across Mali and Niger into Libya for onward transshipment and distribution.      Over the past decade, Moroccan cannabis farmers have substituted traditional seeds with hybrid strains capable of producing larger yields and higher tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) levels.  Yields obtained from hybrid seeds and improved agricultural techniques are three to five times higher than those obtained from traditional cannabis farming methods.  Media and U.S. law enforcement reporting indicates that the switch to hybrid seeds was driven by market forces as European customers demanded a higher quality THC product.  Accurate estimates for cannabis cultivation and hashish production levels are not available.    Morocco remains a transit point for the commercial and non-commercial maritime shipment of cocaine smuggled into Europe.  South American and Mexican drug trafficking organizations utilize West Africa as a transit point for cocaine smuggled into the European market, and Morocco remains a key transit point for this route.  Transnational criminal organizations take advantage of Morocco’s pre-existing hashish transportation networks to facilitate the flow of cocaine from West Africa to Europe.  During 2018, a coordinated operation between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and Morocco law enforcement dismantled a commercial maritime operation smuggling cocaine from Brazil to Europe via containerized shipping transiting the port of Casablanca, arresting one Brazilian and five Moroccans.  Six vehicles, 541 kilograms of cocaine, and approximately $1.5 million were seized.  Media reports indicate Moroccan hashish continues to be smuggled to South America and the Caribbean in exchange for cocaine transported to Europe for distribution.    The United States has a mutual legal assistance treaty with Morocco that entered into force in 1993.  The U.S. does not have an extradition treaty with Morocco, but Morocco has been willing to surrender fugitives to the United States via deportation, expulsion, or otherwise lawful removal pursuant to its domestic law.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 217  Mozambique  Mozambique continues to be a transit point for heroin, hashish, cocaine, and precursor chemicals.  Transnational criminal organizations based in Asia and South America use Mozambique as a transit hub both to access the South African market and to move products through neighboring countries to their final destinations in Europe and North America.  Cocaine transiting through Mozambique from South America is also becoming more prevalent given the ease of access.  Resource constraints, endemic corruption, its long coastline, and porous unguarded land borders hamper drug control efforts in Mozambique.   Criminal organizations exploit Mozambique’s vast, largely unpatrolled coastline.  Heroin and hashish are primarily imported via maritime shipments from South Asia.  Shipments arrive hidden in cargo containers or on ships anchored illegally off Mozambique’s coastline where they are off-loaded onto smaller watercraft.  Cocaine from South America arrives via commercial flights, transported by courier, or hidden in air cargo.  Once in the country, illicit drugs can easily be warehoused and transported via the national highway system to any of six neighboring countries.  Access to major international air and cargo hubs both in Mozambique and South Africa allow for further international distribution.    The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has established a working relationship with the office of the Attorney General (PGR) and Mozambique’s National Criminal Investigations Service (SERNIC).  SERNIC investigates and prosecutes all major criminal activity in Mozambique.  In 2018, SERNIC agreed to establish a joint DEA/SERNIC drug investigative unit to combat transnational organized crime.  The primary objective of this bilateral cooperation is to increase Mozambique’s law enforcement capacity and promote future sustainability.   Although systemic challenges remain, SERNIC executed two significant arrests of well-known international heroin brokers.  Notably, in addition to indicting the suspects on drug-related charges, the PGR identified and evaluated evidence of official corruption.  As a result, investigators expect those involved will be penalized and additional arrests will be made, serving as a good example of the Government of Mozambique’s political will to confront drug-related crime and corruption.    The United States has neither a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty nor an extradition treaty with Mozambique.  Some mutual legal assistance requests are processed under multilateral conventions that enable such cooperation.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 218  The Netherlands   The Netherlands is a significant transit country for illicit drugs, especially cocaine, entering through the port of Rotterdam.  The Netherlands also remains an important source country of synthetic drugs, primarily MDMA (ecstasy), destined for international markets.  The volume of internet-facilitated trafficking of synthetic drugs through the country has increased significantly.    The Dutch Opium Act prohibits the possession, commercial distribution, production, preparation of production, import, and export of all illicit drugs.  The act distinguishes between “hard” drugs (e.g., heroin, cocaine, MDMA), and “soft” drugs (cannabis products).  Sales of less than five grams of cannabis products are “tolerated” (illegal but not prosecuted) in regulated establishments called “coffee shops.”  Enforcement is a local matter; for example, some cities choose to implement a requirement limiting coffee shop purchases to local residents, while others, including Amsterdam, do not.    A study by the police estimated that the total revenue of synthetic drugs production in the Netherlands in 2017 was close to 20 billion euros.  Synthetic drug producers are considered to be at the source of various other types of crime, including local government corruption, especially in the south of the Netherlands.  The national government prioritized fighting organized drugs groups.    Dutch police and mail delivery companies established a Mail/Parcel Intervention Team (PIT) in 2017 to intercept outbound envelopes and parcels containing small amounts of drugs.   The port of Rotterdam is a European import hub for cocaine from South America.  In 2017 (the most recent year for which data is available), authorities seized 5.3 metric tons of cocaine in the port of Rotterdam.  However, due to increased efforts by authorities, Dutch drug smuggling gangs increasingly use the port of Antwerp as a point of entry.  There have been incidents of fraud and corruption within the port authority and associated businesses.      Historically, Dutch and U.S. law enforcement agencies have maintained close operational cooperation, but due to a recent reorganization of the Dutch police and capacity issues, there has been a significant decrease in the exchange of information.  The United States and the Netherlands have fully operational extradition and mutual legal assistance agreements.    The Royal Netherlands Navy patrols the Dutch Caribbean for drug interdiction operations.  The Netherlands has a memorandum of understanding with the United States, which enables the deployment of U.S. Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment Teams and Airborne Use of Force Detachments on Royal Netherlands Navy vessels to suppress illicit trafficking in the waters of the Caribbean.  The Netherlands is a party to the Caribbean Regional Maritime Agreement and a partner in the U.S. Joint Interagency Task Force South.  The Netherlands is a member of the Maritime Analysis and Operation Centre-Narcotics.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 219  Nicaragua  A.  Introduction    Nicaragua remains a transit route for illicit drug trafficking, and domestic production of marijuana also occurs in the country.  Nicaragua’s long Atlantic and Pacific coasts, large inland lakes, porous border crossings, and sparsely populated and underdeveloped Caribbean coastal region provide a favorable environment for international criminal groups to smuggle contraband, including drugs, weapons, currency, and people.  Although there is no statistical data to determine current drug consumption trends within Nicaragua, marijuana and crack cocaine are believed to be the most commonly consumed illicit drugs within the country.    Nicaragua does not have sufficient resources to exercise complete control over its air, land, and sea borders.  Nicaragua’s limited technical and logistical capacity to conduct successful interdiction operations, including a lack of dedicated air assets, is further challenged by limited mobility and communications to patrol the sparsely populated parts of the Caribbean region where some traffickers operate freely.   Nicaragua’s efforts to fight drug trafficking are hindered by widespread corruption within the ranks of the police, the prosecutor general’s office, and the supreme court.  Drug control cooperation between Nicaraguan authorities and international counterparts is limited and inconsistent, and all levels of government lack transparency.   B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends     1.  Institutional Development    The Nicaraguan National Police and Nicaraguan military are the primary institutions responsible for countering drug trafficking in the country.  There is limited information sharing between the two institutions and there is limited law enforcement coverage of the country, particularly in the sparsely populated Caribbean Coast region.  The Nicaraguan military continues to target illicit drugs through its “Retaining Wall” strategy, which incorporates land-based, air, and maritime patrolling from permanent bases located at key border crossings and maritime and air routes.  Coupled with limited resources, however, the principal challenge for Nicaraguan authorities in 2018 was the politicization of the police and the restive political climate resulting from the government’s harsh repression of widespread protests.        On August 23, the Government of Nicaragua appointed Francisco Diaz, who was sanctioned by the United States under the Global Magnitsky Act, as the new National Police Director.  Diaz was sanctioned due to his involvement in serious human rights abuses against political opponents.  According to local security experts, a police unit tasked with anti-organized crime responsibilities is also involved in grave violations of human rights, including illegal detentions of protestors.  The police promoted 452 officers of this unit in September.   Nicaragua maintains close ties with Russia.  In April, Russia trained 20 police officers from Central America, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic at a Russian Counternarcotics Training \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 220  Center in Managua, but the effectiveness of cooperation agreements with Russia against drug trafficking is not yet visible.  Also in April, the Nicaraguan and Honduran military forces signed a cooperation agreement to continue joint operations and maintain security levels in both countries; however, a lack of vetted units, limited information sharing, lack of transparency, and limited working-level cooperation hinder regional operation efforts against organized crime and drug trafficking.   Nicaragua participates in the Cooperative Situational and Information Integration System, which enables greater international law enforcement intelligence sharing.  A maritime counterdrug bilateral agreement has also been in place between Nicaragua and the United States since 2001.  However, information sharing from Nicaragua is limited, and often not accurate or timely.     The Inter-American Convention on Mutual Legal Assistance in Criminal Matters, to which Nicaragua and the United States are both parties, facilitates the sharing of legal information between countries.  In spite of being part of this treaty, cooperation in this area is not robust due to the low volume of requests.  In the past, the Government of Nicaragua has rarely provided assistance within requested time frames.   The United States and Nicaragua are parties to an extradition treaty signed in 1905 and ratified in 1907, but the Nicaraguan Constitution bars the extradition of Nicaraguan citizens.  Cooperation by the Government of Nicaragua with extradition requests has historically been very limited.  An International Criminal Police Organization Red Notice is usually required for wanted individuals in order for the Government of Nicaragua to cooperate with the United States in expelling non-Nicaraguan citizen fugitives.       2.  Supply Reduction    There was no discernible change in the volume of drugs transiting Nicaragua in 2018.  However, there continues to be evidence of increased domestic drug use, increased illegal drug production (mainly of marijuana), and the existence of clandestine airstrips in remote areas of the country.  Though some traffickers continue to smuggle illicit drugs through the isolated Caribbean Coast, many trafficking organizations have shifted their operations to deep-water routes off the Pacific Coast using larger, longer-range transportation.  This allows larger quantities of drugs to travel further out to sea, avoiding detection by law enforcement and the threat of pirates in the Caribbean regions.    Illicit drugs are also trafficked via land and air.  Beginning in April 2018, drug trafficking organizations changed their routes due to roadblocks raised during the political unrest. Traffickers temporarily utilized more sea vessels and aircraft as alternatives, but at the close of 2018 there was evidence that traffickers were slowly returning to land routes.   The Nicaraguan government reported that it conducted 4,416 operations targeting local and international drug trafficking in 2018, a 44 percent reduction from the 7,833 operations conducted in 2017.  The government also reported seizing 2.58 metric tons (MT) of cocaine during the first nine months of 2018, a 46 percent decrease from the 4.8 MT seized in all 2017.  The Nicaraguan Navy reported seizing 725 kilograms of the total cocaine seized in the country.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 221  Authorities also reportedly seized 1.58 MT of marijuana; destroyed 36,821 cannabis plants growing along the country’s Caribbean Coast; and seized $11,263,060 in cash, 295 vehicles, 150 weapons, 926 communications devices, and four boats.  Authorities reportedly arrested 2,305 people for drug crimes (1,138 of whom had been formally accused in court as of October).  Nicaraguan authorities do not share with U.S. officials any information about their methods of destroying seized illicit drugs.     3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   There are no reliable national statistics on drug consumption within Nicaragua, but there are anecdotal reports of increased use of marijuana, crack, and powder cocaine, especially in the Caribbean Coast regions and among adolescents.  The lack of statistics makes it difficult to measure the impact of prevention and treatment programs.    The Government of Nicaragua reports that the Nicaraguan National Police, in coordination with the Ministry of Education, the Institute Against Alcoholism and Drug Addiction, rehabilitation centers, and other government institutions, provided drug prevention education for 12,167 youths in 164 schools in 2018.  In 2018 the government reached only 5 percent of the 240,000 youth reached in 2017, and only 1 percent of the school age population.  The Nicaraguan government also reported offering drug prevention activities for 19,201 young people with substance use disorders and 648 juvenile offenders, to include educational movie screenings, prevention talks, neighborhood meetings, as well as marches, sports, and cultural activities to raise awareness and to prevent violence and drug use.    The police have cooperation agreements with 14 of the 22 privately run drug rehabilitation centers, to which they refer substance abusers.  In 2018, the government referred 134 youth to the 14 centers.  According to administrators at private rehabilitation centers, as a result of the socio-political unrest, there is an exponential increase in requests for rehabilitation for young people between 15-25 years of age.   Private treatment centers in Nicaragua offer two models of patient service: outpatient and residential.  Free treatment centers are scarce in Nicaragua, and some treatment centers charge a high monthly fee between $2,000 and $3,000 per patient.  Non-governmental organizations continue efforts to prevent drug use and provide treatment to those suffering from substance abuse.  The United States provides support to fund programs focused on citizen security, drug prevention, and life skills for at-risk youth, including a grant for a multi-media drug and violence prevention campaign that has reached more than one million people.    4.  Corruption    The Government of Nicaragua does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, and there were no public indications that it is involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.   Nicaragua’s close relationship with Venezuela, reports of institutional corruption at all levels, and international claims that officials in Nicaragua were complicit in money laundering are of \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 222  concern.  In December 2017, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned Roberto Rivas under Global Magnitsky authority for corruption.  Rivas was serving as President of the Supreme Electoral Council.  The Office of the Controller General of Nicaragua failed to investigate his corruption and the origin of his considerable personal wealth.   The head of a counterdrug patrol, who had been sentenced to an 11-year prison term for killing a woman and two children during a failed  operation in July 2015, was promoted in September 2018 to the rank of Commissioner and decorated for “heroic actions” while supposedly in prison.   Although Nicaragua’s criminal law contains provisions against corruption such as bribery, abuse of authority, influence peddling, and embezzlement, the politicization of and corruption within the police and the judicial system hinder meaningful prosecution of serious crimes.  There is also a law regarding the investigation and prosecution of organized crime (Law 735), but in 2018 it was used to criminalize government opponents.  Law 735 provides for the establishment of a unit to administer seized assets; however, there is no public accountability in how seized assets are managed.  In 2018, the government did not enforce criminal laws against corruption; instead, there was impunity for corrupt officials loyal to the ruling political party.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   Bilateral drug control cooperation between Nicaragua and the United States is limited and inconsistent.  However, the Nicaraguan government has demonstrated some willingness to take action on information about drug-related activities provided by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA).  Information provided by DEA to Nicaraguan authorities resulted in successful interdiction of 2.3 MT of cocaine and $12.7 million in cash in 2018.  The United States also supported the participation of two police officers at the International Drug Enforcement Conference in 2018 to strengthen regional interoperability, and continues to support the integration and active participation of Nicaragua into the Cooperative Situational and Information Integration System.   The United States cooperates with the Nicaraguan Navy to enhance maritime interdiction capacity.  In 2018, the United States provided equipment to support drug interdiction, refurbished four boats and trailers, and provided parts for two additional boats at a total cost of $600,753.   In 2018, consistent with U.S. policy to reduce the flow of illegal drugs to the United States and improve security in Central America, the United States assisted Nicaragua by funding drug demand reduction programs with non-governmental organizations.  The programs are implemented in the North and South Caribbean Autonomous Regions, the Managua area, and some departments on the Pacific side of the country, where populations are vulnerable to drugs and violence.  These grant projects have served to increase citizen security through drug prevention awareness campaigns, community development, youth leadership training, and alternative education intervention programs for at-risk youth in Nicaragua.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 223  The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Nicaragua to suppress illicit traffic by sea, which includes provisions regarding ship boarding, ship riders, pursuit, entry into territorial waters, overflight, order to land, and international maritime interdiction support.  Nicaragua was a participant in the semi-annual Multilateral Maritime Counter Drug Summit held in May, which attracted 125 maritime counterdrug professionals from 26 countries and over 65 international agencies spanning North, Central, and South America and Europe.      D.  Conclusion    The Government of Nicaragua has developed policies and programs to combat drug trafficking and reduce drug demand, but should improve its efforts to combat organized crime by expanding its capacity to monitor air, land, and maritime space within the vulnerable Caribbean Coast and Pacific border regions of the country.  Productive and more transparent efforts to combat organized crime would require a change in government policy, a political commitment to fight corruption, and the professionalization of the police, as well as halting the counterproductive diversion of police resources to the repression of peaceful protesters.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 224  Niger  Niger is a transit point for illicit drug trafficking and is also experiencing a rapidly expanding drug consumption problem.  Instability stemming from ongoing violent extremist conflict in the country’s southern and western regions, as well as instability in Libya to the North – all pose challenges to the government’s drug interdiction efforts.     Illicit drug trafficking is concentrated along Niger’s southern border with Nigeria, as well as within Northern Niger and the city of Agadez.  The National Police of Niger have a dedicated counterdrug unit, the Central Office for the Suppression of Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs, consisting of approximately 100 officers.       Transnational criminal organizations are involved in trafficking drugs through Niger.  Illicit opioids and other pharmaceutical drugs are readily available, as are cannabis and hashish originating from Morocco.  The Government of Niger and civil society leaders are increasingly concerned with growing illicit drug use among the population, primarily among youth.  Consumption of methamphetamine, flunitrazepam, and the synthetic opioid tramadol is growing, fueled by high unemployment and low costs.    The director of the National Police and other security officials have identified illicit proceeds from the drug trade as corrosive to their respective organizations.  The United States has several programs to assist the Government of Niger in addressing corruption, operational planning, and improving border management, through support to the border police known as the Directorate of Territorial Surveillance (Direction de la Surveillance du Territoire).    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 225  Nigeria  A.  Introduction  Nigerian drug traffickers remain the preeminent international drug trafficking threat based in Africa.  Nigerian trafficking networks operate in the United States as well as throughout Africa, South America, Europe, and Asia.  Nigerian drug traffickers have strengthened partnerships with international cocaine and heroin distribution networks to procure and distribute significant quantities of drugs in the United States and other lucrative markets.    Nigeria is also experiencing an opioid epidemic.  The most widely used opioid in Nigeria is tramadol, a pharmaceutical product originating mostly from India.  Both legitimate Indian pharmaceutical companies and illicit clandestine labs mass-produce and ship tramadol and counterfeit tramadol tablets in 200, 225, and 250-milligram dosages for the Nigerian market.  Members of the Nigerian Customs Service (NCS) regularly interdict container loads of tramadol at Apapa Port in Lagos based on intelligence from the National Drug Law Enforcement Agency (NDLEA).  The NCS declines to release the tramadol to NDLEA for destruction, and NDLEA reports that NCS officers frequently sell seized tramadol back to its original owners.  Codeine is also widely abused, particularly by women in northern Nigeria.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1. Institutional Development  During 2018, the NDLEA received a major boost in capacity following the complete refurbishment of the NDLEA Murtala Muhammed International Airport (MMIA) Command office building into a state-of-the-art complex, which is now the site of the newly formed Joint Border Task Force (JBTF).  The $10 million JBTF project is mostly funded and overseen by the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency (NCA).  The JBTF is a multi-agency effort to target, interdict, disrupt, dismantle, and prosecute Nigerian-based transnational criminal organizations.  The task force, a joint endeavor supported by both the United States and the United Kingdom, is comprised of fully vetted and well-trained Nigerian law enforcement investigators.  MMIA is viewed as the gateway for Nigerian criminal organizations involved in drug smuggling, as well as the movement of unlawful proceeds; human trafficking/smuggling; wildlife trafficking; weapons trafficking; and an array of other illegal cross-border activity.  The NDLEA is the lead agency at the JBTF, contributing 140 officers and investigators who receive mentoring and investigative assistance from U.S. and UK law enforcement professionals embedded within the unit.  The task force is further comprised of 20 investigative officers from the National Agency for the Prohibition of Trafficking of Persons (NAPTIP), as well as six prosecutors.  2. Supply Reduction  In 2018, the United States continued to assist in transitioning the NDLEA from a reactive agency to an intelligence-driven one through mentoring and investigative support.  During the first eight months of 2018, the NDLEA reported the arrests of 4,736 individuals on drug trafficking charges (4,395 men and 341 women).  The agency seized approximately 59 metric tons (MT) of \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 226  cannabis; 119 kilograms (kg) of methamphetamine; 17 MT of tramadol; and approximately eight MT of codeine-infused cough syrup.  The NDLEA reports that in 2018, the agency destroyed 267 MT of seized drugs overall.  In addition to these totals, the U.S.-supported NDLEA Sensitive Investigative Unit (SIU) is credited with seizing and destroying over 1,700 hectares of cannabis plantations; six-and-a-half MT of processed cannabis; four MT of tramadol; four kg of cocaine; and 250 kg of ephedrine.  The SIU seized properties and financial instruments approximately totaling $2 million and arrested 25 drug traffickers.  Additionally, the SIU shared intelligence with counterparts in Benin and Japan that led to seizures of methamphetamine totaling 40 kg.   3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Consumption of illicit and misused drugs within Nigeria is increasing alarmingly.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) has called on the government of Nigeria to address the growing abuse of pharmaceuticals by many Nigerian youths.   While cocaine is not readily accessible to the middle and lower classes, drugs such as codeine, rohypnol, and tramadol are accessible and available from street vendors on the streets of every city and town in Nigeria.    The NDLEA’s Demand Reduction Directorate nominally has programs that target youth, sex workers, community leaders, and transport workers.  However, resources allocated for counseling and rehabilitation for substance use disorders are negligible.   4. Corruption  A large percentage of senior government officials are engaged, either directly or indirectly, in corrupt practices.  In 2017 (the latest available data), the annual operating budget for the NDLEA was approximately $25,450,000.  Salaries alone for the 5,001 NDLEA personnel were estimated at approximately $24,000,000, leaving the entire organization to operate on a meager $1,450,000 per year.  NDLEA is comprised of 42 commands that typically each receive approximately $2,800 per month to fund their operations, to include fuel for vehicles and generators, utilities, travel, and various investigative expenses.  In 2018, NDLEA staff from various commands reported that no funds were dispersed.  This failure at both the institutional and federal government levels encourages NDLEA staff to supplement their salaries and enforcement activities through the acceptance of bribes and extortion.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The NDLEA’s primary national goals for 2018 were the passage of a Drug Sentencing Bill requesting a mandatory minimum five-year sentence for drug possession, and an increase of 15,000 personnel.  The sentencing bill remained pending before the National Assembly at the conclusion of 2018, and although President Muhammmadu Buhari approved the agency’s request for an increase in personnel in 2017, funding had not been allocated to begin recruitment.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 227  D.  Conclusion  The NDLEA provides a framework for the Government of Nigeria to pursue its drug control objectives and cooperate with international partners to achieve these goals.  To increase the agency’s effectiveness, the government of Nigeria will need to provide, and equitably distribute, increased funding and training to the NDLEA.  The United States will continue to engage the Government of Nigeria to combat drug trafficking, corruption, money laundering, and other criminal issues.  The institutional and societal factors that contribute to these criminal activities remain deeply rooted and will require a comprehensive and collaborative effort.  Progress will require sustained Nigerian government efforts and an increased political will.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 228  Pakistan  A.  Introduction  Pakistan continues to be one of the world’s top transit corridors for opiates and cannabis products, which are trafficked through the country’s porous borders with Afghanistan and Iran.  Once in Pakistan, illicit drugs are subsequently trafficked globally through Pakistan’s seaports, airports, postal services, and unpatrolled coastal areas.  The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimates Pakistan is the destination and transit country for approximately 45 percent of the opiates produced in Afghanistan.  Pakistan is also a major transit country for precursor chemicals used to produce heroin and methamphetamine, though Pakistan is only able to interdict a fraction of the chemicals funneled through the country.     Due to a lack of reliable data since 2016, it is difficult to estimate current levels of poppy cultivation.  Most opium poppy cultivation continues to take place in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP) province and the areas formerly known as the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), enabled by low levels of economic development and civilian security in these regions.       In 2018, Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies reported to have disrupted 13 domestic and international drug trafficking organizations.  Pakistan’s Anti-Narcotics Force (ANF), the country’s lead drug enforcement agency and staffed at senior levels by the Pakistani military, reported that during the first 10 months of 2018 it seized approximately 53 metric tons (MT) of morphine, heroin, opium, cocaine, and hashish – a two-thirds decrease from what was seized during the same period in 2017.  The Government of Pakistan’s budget limitations and, in some cases, lack of political will hindered drug control efforts.  As poppy cultivation and opiate production increase in Afghanistan, Pakistan’s limited resources and law enforcement capacity will be further strained.    Domestic drug consumption continues to be an area of concern.  According to a 2013 UNODC nationwide survey, Pakistan is home to 6.7 million drug users, and approximately 20 MT of heroin is consumed within the country annually.  Pakistan currently lacks the capacity to provide effective, non-residential treatment for substance use disorder and to incorporate an evidence-based approach systematically to drug prevention education.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  ANF is an agency within Pakistan’s Ministry of Narcotics Control (MNC).  In 2018, the MNC finalized a long-awaited revision of its national drug control policy, last amended in 2011.  Formal publication of the policy is expected in early 2019.  The Ministry also initiated a precursor control oversight mechanism, though such efforts were still nascent at the close of 2018.     ANF’s 2018 budget was $18.6 million, a 9 percent increase over 2017.  The Government of Pakistan indicated that it plans to increase ANF’s budget in 2019 to $19.3 million.  Nevertheless, \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 229  the funds are insufficient to support ANF’s daunting mission and limit its capacity to perform key functions adequately, such as operational maintenance of vehicles and equipment.  Over 60 percent of ANF’s budget is used to pay the salaries of its 3,100 employees, who are thinly deployed across 40 stations and field offices.  These posts span every province and territory, except the former FATA.  ANF anticipates establishing a new coastal regional directorate with jurisdiction along the Makran Coast.  The coastal directorate will more than double the agency’s capacity in the province by adding 25 officers and 655 staff.  However, due to budget constraints, personnel have not been hired yet.  In 2018, the ANF Academy provided instruction to over 300 trainees across Pakistan’s law enforcement community.     In 2018, ANF continued nominally to chair the Inter-Agency Task Force (IATF), comprising 27 Pakistani agencies and intended to enhance coordination and communication on drug control.  However, the IATF’s effectiveness is negligible and it did not meet in 2018.      ANF coordinated illicit drug investigations with multiple foreign counterparts in 2018, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, South Africa, Malaysia, Greece, Spain, Poland, Germany, and the United Arab Emirates.  Pakistan hosts 39 foreign Drug Liaison Officers as part of its Paris Pact obligations.  ANF also partnered with the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and the United Kingdom’s National Crime Agency to operate several Special Investigative Cells (SICs).      The United States and Pakistan do not have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty.  Pakistan is a party to relevant multilateral law enforcement conventions that have mutual legal assistance provisions.  The United States and Pakistan can also make and receive requests for assistance on the basis of domestic laws.  Enforcement of the 1931 Extradition Treaty between the United States and the United Kingdom (adopted by Pakistan upon independence) has been problematic.     2.  Supply Reduction  In 2018, Pakistan’s law enforcement agencies reported multiple noteworthy seizures and claim to have disrupted 13 domestic and international drug trafficking organizations.  ANF reported that during the first 10 months of 2018, it seized approximately five MT of morphine and heroin; four MT of opium; 2.5 kilograms of cocaine; and 41.5 MT of hashish.  Overall 2018 seizure totals by ANF represent a two-thirds decrease from 2017, and the total volume of cocaine seized in 2018 was negligible.  Twenty additional law enforcement agencies reported arresting nearly 36,000 individuals for drug trafficking.  Those agencies reported seizing over 106 MT of morphine, heroin, opium, cocaine, and hashish, as compared to 51 MT seized during the same period in 2017.    According to a 2009 UNODC study, the most recent available, 160 to 200 MT of Afghan heroin and 350 to 400 MT of opium were trafficked from Afghanistan to Pakistan annually.  Pakistan is only able to interdict a fraction of that traffic.  The overwhelming majority of drugs trafficked through Pakistan are destined for global markets, while a minority is consumed within Pakistan.  ANF represents less than one-half of 1 percent of Pakistan law enforcement personnel in the country.  The rest of the nearly 700,000 police and paramilitary forces in Pakistan lack rigorous drug interdiction training, and most do not address it as part of their core mission.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 230     Pakistan’s main opium poppy growing areas are in the former FATA and Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP).  Insecurity and extremist activity in these regions have prevented reliable ground surveying to determine precise cultivation levels.  ANF reported 34 hectares (ha) of poppy were cultivated during the 2017-2018 growing season, all of which were reportedly eradicated.  However, these figures are unreliable.  The most recent U.S. government estimates from 2016 indicate that approximately 1,400 ha were under cultivation in traditional poppy growing areas.  Alternative livelihood and development programs for farmers, including distribution of seeds, agricultural training, and construction of small-scale roads and irrigation projects, have discouraged poppy cultivation in some communities of KP.  Pakistan depends heavily on foreign assistance to implement and monitor such programs.  The United States government has provided over $50 million since 1989 for these types of programs, benefitting over 1.2 million Pakistanis and contributing to an estimated 87 percent decrease in poppy cultivation since that time.  ANF is responsible for conducting complex drug investigations with a small staff, while working within a judicial system where prosecutors and judges are overworked, underpaid, and ill-prepared to prosecute cases that involve modern investigative techniques.  Suspects arrested by ANF are tried in special drug courts that hear only those cases brought by ANF’s own prosecutor corps.  During the first 10 months of 2018, ANF registered 1,000 drug arrest cases.  ANF reported that 96 percent of the total cases brought to trial resulted in convictions, with 20 percent of the convictions overturned on appeal.  However, the vast majority of prosecuted cases were low-level possession or small quantity courier trafficking.  Pakistan has a conspiracy law, but it is rarely pursued in drug cases, hindering prosecutions of high-value targets.  Lengthy trial and appeal processes mean that suspects can spend years in pre-trial or under-trial detention before a final verdict is reached.    Though the ANF is a federal agency, Pakistan devolved considerable authority to its provinces under its 18th amendment in 2010 for responsibilities including health and social welfare.  However, provincial drug control units are still in nascent stages of operation.  Enhanced coordination between provincial and federal efforts would benefit overall drug control performance within the country, as would enhanced coordination between federal agencies through the IATF.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment    UNODC’s 2013 nationwide drug use survey indicated that 6.7 million Pakistanis aged 15 to 64 had used drugs for non-medical purposes at least once in the previous 12 months.  In total, the survey classified 4.25 million drug users aged 15 to 64 as suffering from substance use disorders.  Cannabis and opioids were the most prevalent drugs consumed.  The survey results also showed that for the 1.5 million female drug users, the majority reported misuse of opioid-based painkillers or synthetic tranquilizers and sedatives, rather than the cannabis, heroin, and opium used by male drug users.      In 2018, Pakistan continued efforts to raise public awareness about the dangers of illicit drug use.  ANF conducted 245 public awareness-raising activities and lectured frequently at universities, colleges, and schools about drug awareness.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 231   ANF opened two new drug treatment centers in 2018, adding 120 beds and increasing existing capacity by 62 percent.  However, Pakistan could make better use of provincial-level institutions, such as hospitals and medical centers, to provide non-residential treatment options.  Pakistan’s drug treatment capacity, with fewer than 100 clinics operating nationwide, remains insufficient.  Due to insufficient government resources, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) operate more than 90 percent of Pakistan’s detoxification centers.  Because Pakistan lacks the institutional capacity to serve women, the majority of drug users receiving treatment are men.  Donor-funded “train-the-trainer” programs have increased the number of addiction centers that provide evidence-based treatment.     4.  Corruption  The Government of Pakistan does not, as a matter of government policy, encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  However, corruption remains a challenge, undermining the country’s criminal justice system.  The National Accountability Board (NAB) is Pakistan’s anti-graft agency responsible for eliminating corruption.  Since it was established more than 17 years ago, the NAB has recovered more than $2 billion and has received and taken action on more than 370,000 complaints.  Yet, the consequences for convicted perpetrators are rarely severe.  Corruption corrodes the government’s ability to address illicit drugs, as bribed public servants may facilitate movement of contraband or otherwise interfere with the arrest and prosecution of suspects.       C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives    The United States remains strongly committed to a comprehensive approach to drug control assistance in Pakistan.  U.S. supply reduction assistance builds Pakistani capacity to interdict drug shipments and dismantle criminal organizations.  The United States strives to help all relevant Pakistani law enforcement entities develop their capacity to conduct sophisticated operations, such as controlled deliveries, financial crime investigations, and container profiling.  To counter illicit drug trafficking and transnational organized crime effectively, the United States aims to help Pakistan cultivate a model for collaborative, intelligence-driven, and corruption-free law enforcement by facilitating interagency, cross-border, and international coordination.  The United States also provides alternative means for farmers to grow licit crops instead of poppy, including the distribution of seeds, the construction of small roads, and alternative livelihood irrigation projects.      Over the past five years, U.S. supply reduction assistance has mainly funded poppy reduction programs and ANF interdiction activities.  In 2018, bilateral cooperation on interdiction programs between the United States and Pakistan shifted to a more strategic framework, including a focus on cross-border cooperation with Afghan counterparts and an emphasis on capacity building, rather than assistance for daily operating costs.  The United States continued to strengthen and diversify cooperation with law enforcement agencies, including by signing a memorandum of understanding with a provincial drug control department for the first time.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 232  To support demand reduction and recovery efforts, the United States funds various drug treatment and practitioner training programs.  In 2018, the U.S. government continued its assistance to NGOs operating free-of-charge drug treatment centers and prevention activities, prioritizing the funding of projects benefitting women and children, and providing training for drug treatment professionals to improve evidence-based protocols.  Working with the Colombo Plan and UNODC, the U.S. government funded 53 drug awareness campaigns in 2018, and provided free-of-cost residential treatment for nearly 500 patients with substance use disorders, including 28 women and 140 adolescents.  The U.S. government also provided training to 330 youth leaders and teachers, as well as 65 drug treatment professionals.  U.S. assistance continued to focus on evidence-based approaches to treatment and prevention.  D.  Conclusion  Pakistan continues to face enormous economic and security challenges that often supersede drug trafficking in national security priorities, thus limiting attention and resources put toward drug control.  Pakistan could reduce drug trafficking more effectively by encouraging its law enforcement agencies to better coordinate engagement, share information more readily, and expend limited resources more efficiently.  There is also a need for greater investigative focus on the financial aspects of the drug trade, including better training to counter money laundering.  Pakistan should also look to strengthen drug control cooperation with neighboring countries, do more to target high-level drug kingpins rather than low-level traffickers, and focus on maritime interdiction along the Makran Coast.  Greater mobilization of provincial institutions could provide an important multiplier for interdiction, prevention, and service delivery.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 233  Panama  A.  Introduction   Panama is not a major producer of illicit drugs, but transnational criminal organizations take advantage of the country’s transportation infrastructure, free trade zones, and the canal to smuggle cocaine to the United States and other international markets.  Although Panama does not suffer from extensive domestic drug consumption, the increasing flow of drugs from Colombia makes greater domestic drug use a distinct possibility.   Panama is a regional leader in the fight against the international drug trade and transnational criminal organizations, and a trusted strategic U.S. partner in interdicting illicit drug shipments.  The United States collaborates well with all of Panama’s security services, which continue to make progress in developing their institutional capacity.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1. Institutional Developments   Panama continues to improve its security institutions, with U.S. assistance playing an important role.  While the Ministry of Public Security increased its budget for the tenth consecutive year in 2018, Panamanian security institutions continue to face challenges with interagency cooperation, procurement management, and budget constraints hampering its ability to combat human and drug trafficking networks.  Panama’s security forces are often hampered by their inability to fund basic costs associated with core security and drug enforcement missions.  In an attempt to overcome challenges in interagency operational coordination, the Ministry of Public Security has since created an interagency task force led by a former Minister of Public Security.  The effectiveness of this task force on Panama’s drug enforcement operations are to be determined.  Panama’s National Police (PNP) continues to reform its training of Antinarcotics Police Officers.  Through the National Public Safety Institute, basic and commissioned officers receive ongoing basic and advance training, including drug identification, overdose response, and tactical entries/takedowns, basic drug investigations, as well as undercover operations, complex conspiracy courses.     In 2018, the Government of Panama fully implemented Real Time Crime Centers (DACTERS in Spanish) throughout the country, providing data analytics that contributed to a significant reduction in major crimes including homicides and drug trafficking.  The PNP uses comparative statistics (COMPSTAT) to analyze criminal trends, redistributing its resources and officers that resulted in greater success against gangs and drug trafficking in 2018.   In 2016, Panama fully implemented an accusatory justice system similar to the U.S. system to increase transparency, reduce pretrial detention, and adjudicate cases quicker.  Since the transition to the accusatory justice system, the length of time required to resolve cases dropped from an average of 296 days to 42 days, according to a 2018 academic study.  According to Panama’s Office of Drug Prosecution, since 2016, Panama convictions of drug-related crimes \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 234  have been above 90 percent, achieving a 98 percent conviction rate in 2018.  While the Government of Panama continues to demonstrate an increased capacity in drug prosecutions, there still remains challenges in the investigation and prosecution of complex cases.  The United States collaborates effectively with Panama’s 27 district attorneys responsible for prosecuting drug trafficking crimes, especially those handling maritime interdiction cases in conjunction with the Panamanian Coast Guard (SENAN) and border force (SENAFRONT), which patrol rivers and coastal areas.  Although the number of drug-related prosecutions increased in 2018, few leaders of drug trafficking organizations were successfully prosecuted.  The justice sector continues to struggle with complex cases such as money laundering, organized crime, and criminal forfeiture cases, and official corruption remains a problem.    Panama has mutual assistance and extradition treaties with the United States, but Panama’s constitution does not permit extradition of Panamanian nationals.    2.  Supply Reduction   Panamanian authorities seized approximately 73 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs in 2018.  With U.S. assistance, SENAN routinely interdicted maritime narcotics shipments, often based on information provided by U.S. authorities or other Panamanian agencies.  When provided intelligence by the United States or other international partners, SENAN acted upon 90 percent of reports and 20 percent of operations resulted in seizures.  SENAN seized 22.5 MT of illicit drugs, mostly cocaine, and 28 vessels; 77 individuals were arrested in the course of these operations.  In 2018, SENAN’s interdiction success rate of targeted maritime vessels increased by eight percent as compared to 2017.  Panamanian units vetted by the U.S. government and working in partnership with U.S. law enforcement agencies conducted sensitive investigations and operations related to illicit drugs, money laundering, migrant smuggling, and other transnational crimes.  In 2018, investigations and operations by these vetted units resulted in 568 arrests and the seizure of over 26 MT of cocaine and 202.7 MT of marijuana – increases of approximately 32 percent and 3,875 percent, respectively, from what was seized in 2017 and approximately $5.53 million in cash.  Approximately $5.53 million in cash and counterfeit items with a street value of approximately $1.86 million were also seized in 2018, demonstrating significant progress in the development of Panama’s capabilities.  The United States provided state-of-the-art scanning equipment to the Tocumen international airport in 2018 to modernize the processing of more than 15 million passengers transiting this terminal per year.  The equipment operates at a much lower x-ray spectrum, capable of producing full body images that enhances the detection of small quantities of drugs and other commonly smuggled items.  The United States provided similar equipment at the Marcos A. Gelabert Airport, a secondary facility that handles direct flights to Colombia and Costa Rica.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 235  Panama has not experienced high levels of drug usage or gang activity from transnational groups active in other Central American countries.  Local gangs, operating primarily in the Caribbean coast, take part in a variety of criminal activities.  Panamanian officials are increasingly concerned that instability in other countries in the region could eventually spill into Panama and lead to increased drug usage and gang activity.  The increased flow of drugs from Colombia presents greater risks for domestic drug use as well.  The government of Panama has not reported significant use of synthetic opioids, though synthetic drugs have reached the streets of Panama and likely transit the canal in container ships.  Panama has modest drug demand reduction programs in schools and the Ministry of Health supports a drug-counseling program.  Panama has not conducted a drug-demand study since 2015 and has not updated its published strategy on demand reduction since 2007, making it difficult to assess current trends.   The United States partners with the PNP to implement programs such as the Drug Awareness and Resistance Education (DARE), and the Gang Resistance Education and Training Program (GREAT), as well as community policing initiatives, to help at-risk youth.    4.  Corruption   The Government of Panama does not, as a matter of policy, encourage or facilitate illegal drug production or distribution, nor is it involved in laundering the proceeds of the sale of illicit drugs.  However, transnational criminal organizations target the security services, customs, and justice sector to facilitate drug trafficking, raising concerns about official corruption at all levels.  Panamanian authorities recognize the threat and actively investigate officials for corruption.   As part of this effort, the United States assisted SENAN in establishing an internal affairs unit in 2017.  In 2018, this unit dramatically increased the number of pre-employment background investigations and polygraph examinations.  As a result, SENAN rejected multiple individuals with criminal records or other derogatory information.  An investigation from this unit also led to the arrest and conviction in 2018 of two crew members accused of providing locations of patrol vessels to drug traffickers.  Panama will need to continue to institutionalize these aggressive steps to reduce the threat of drug trafficking-fueled corruption.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   Consistent with the U.S. Strategy for Central America and through the Central America Regional Security Initiative (CARSI), the United States supports citizen security, law enforcement, and rule-of-law programs in Panama to expand Panamanian capabilities to interdict, investigate, and prosecute drug trafficking, money laundering, and other transnational crimes while strengthening Panama’s justice sector.  The United States provides assistance to modernize and maintain SENAN, SENAFRONT, and PNP vessels, equipment, and facilities in support of interdiction efforts.  U.S.-provided aviation assets have helped SENAN expand its ability to support joint drug enforcement operations.  The United States supports trilateral cooperation with Panama and Colombia, whereby Colombian law enforcement, justice sector, and military experts train their Panamanian counterparts.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 236   In April 2018, the United States and Panama, together with Costa Rica and Colombia, executed OPERATION KRAKEN II, a month-long multinational surge of interdiction operations modeled on a previous effort taken in 2017.  During this operation, the combined forces seized 9.9 MT of cocaine, 1.7 MT of marijuana, and apprehended 59 individuals of various nationalities.  This operation demonstrated Panama’s ability to efficiently work with the United States and regional partners in complex environments.    The bilateral Salas-Becker Agreement to cooperate on maritime interdiction permits Panamanian security officers to accompany U.S. maritime patrol aircraft and vessels.  The United States provides training to Panamanian authorities to improve implementation of the agreement and enhance interdiction operations.  In May, the United States committed to send five experienced attorneys to Panama to assist in standardizing procedures for prosecuting maritime crime and mentoring prosecutors.  The United States also established a new program in 2018 to provide expert guidance to help Panamanian authorities build maritime interdiction capacity, enhance investigative techniques, and apply best practices during preparation of maritime crime cases for prosecution.  Bilateral U.S.-Panamanian engagement on security issues is facilitated by the High-Level Security Dialogue, an ongoing coordination mechanism initiated in 2017.  D.  Conclusion   Panama has established itself as a regional leader in drug interdiction, and a strategic ally in U.S. efforts to fight transnational criminal organizations and the flow of drugs into the United States.  The Panamanian government has made significant achievements in reforming its justice sector institutions and developing the capacity of its law enforcement agencies.  Despite the Panamanian government’s willingness to combat organized crime and drug trafficking, the increasing volume of drugs from Colombia and the spillover of criminality from neighboring countries exceeds the capabilities of Panama’s security services to manage these challenges alone.    While Panama continues its efforts to lay the groundwork for systemic improvements, bureaucratic and institutional deficiencies prevent it from effectively dealing with transnational criminal organizations.  The United States continues to support Panama’s implementation of reforms and remains committed to partnering with the country’s security services to conduct more effective and organized actions against transnational crime and drug trafficking. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 237  Paraguay  Paraguay made progress in seizing cocaine shipments and improving interagency coordination against illicit drugs in 2018, but remains among the largest source countries for marijuana in the Western Hemisphere and a transit country for Andean cocaine.  Traffickers exploit the country’s porous borders, clandestine airstrips, lack of airspace control, extensive internal waterways, and under-resourced law enforcement and judicial officials to transit cocaine, mainly to Brazil or through Brazil to overseas markets, though rarely the United States.  Transnational criminal organizations engage in drug trafficking and other illicit activities, aided by corruption and legal impunity.  President Abdo Benitez took office on August 15, and his Administration has shown initiative in pursuing counterdrug activities.     During the first nine months of 2018, the National Anti-Drug Secretariat (SENAD) seized and destroyed 893 metric tons (MT) of processed marijuana and eradicated 1,222 hectares (ha) of cannabis.  During the first 10 months of 2018, SENAD seized and destroyed 714 kilograms (kg) of cocaine.  This included a 448 (kg) seizure, SENAD’s single largest seizure since 2012.  In September, SENAD also arrested Paraguayan alleged drug kingpin Reinaldo Javier “Cucho” Cabaña.  During the first nine months of 2018, the Paraguayan National Police seized and destroyed 54 MT of processed marijuana, eradicated 874 ha of cannabis, and seized 99 kg of cocaine.  There were 125 convictions on drug trafficking charges in 2018.  The United States and Paraguay are parties to a 2001 extradition treaty that remains in force.  There is no bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty, though both countries are party to multilateral conventions providing for cooperation in criminal matters.  In June, government representatives issued the 2017 – 2022 Paraguayan National Policy on Drugs.  The National Civil Aviation Authority began installing a radar system in July to monitor illicit air travel and ultimately feed into law enforcement systems.  Paraguayan authorities report an increase in domestic drug consumption.  Outpatient community-based drug treatment programs, supported by the United States and other donors, supplement the three main government-run drug treatment centers, including the Ministry of Health’s 30-bed inpatient detoxification facility.  Paraguay’s 2017 asset forfeiture legislation allocates 50 percent of proceeds to demand reduction and crime prevention efforts.   U.S. law enforcement cooperation continues to help facilitate drug seizures, arrests, and prosecutions by Paraguayan authorities.  Increased Paraguayan government efforts to enhance interagency coordination, improve the judicial system’s ability to prosecute cases quickly and effectively, and reduce corruption would help further deter drug production and trafficking.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 238  Peru  A.  Introduction  Peru was the second-largest producer of cocaine and coca, with an estimated 49,800 hectares (ha) under cultivation in 2017, the most recent year for which data is available.  Potential pure cocaine production in Peru increased to 491 metric tons (MT).  Though the amount cultivated throughout much of Peru decreased in 2017, increased cultivation in the Valley of the Rivers Apurímac, Ene, and Mantaro (VRAEM) negated the successes realized in the remainder of the growing region.  Eradication efforts in the VRAEM are complicated by limited access and significant security challenges that threaten the safety of eradicators.  The areas of Apurimac and Puno account for two-thirds of the country’s cultivation.  Despite this, Peru has demonstrated great successes in alternative development and eradication programs as represented by the decreases in coca cultivation and cocaine production outside of the VRAEM.    Peruvian cocaine is trafficked throughout South America, traveling to Europe, East Asia, Mexico, and the United States.  In addition to coca cultivation, Peru is a major importer of precursor chemicals for cocaine production.  Following former President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski’s resignation in March 2018, President Martín Vizcarra’s government has maintained the commitment to implementing Peru’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy eradication goals.  During the first nine months of 2018, Peru’s coca eradication force (CORAH) eradicated 20,843 ha, completing 83 percent of its annual goal of 25,000 ha.  The military and the Peruvian National Police’s (PNP) anti-drug unit (DIREJANDRO) conducted joint counter-drug operations in the VRAEM.  Peru approved the VRAEM Strategy 2021, which involves heavy investment in development but does not include eradication operations in the region.   The terrorist group Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path), relying upon cocaine trafficking for funding, maintains a strong hold in the VRAEM.  In 2018, the group killed four military personnel and four police officers, and continued to provide a safe haven for drug traffickers.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  The Peruvian government’s 2017-2021 drug control strategy includes goals for eradication, interdiction, and alternative development.  It also addresses the control of precursor chemicals, organized crime, money laundering, and the rule of law.  In 2018, the Government of Peru allocated $134 million towards implementation of this strategy, $16.5 million less than 2017.[1]  Peru contributed $21.2 million towards eradication efforts and concomitant aviation support in 2018, which is equivalent to its 2017 contribution.                                                          [1]Budget calculated from relevant budget line items in Peru’s Ministry of Economy and Finance (MEF) website.  The MEF’s online budget contained a calculation error in previous years in which eradication numbers were duplicated on multiple lines.  The correct counternarcotics strategy implementation budgets from previous years are as follows:  $150.8 million (2017), $142 million (2016), and $145.1 million (2015).     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 239   A 2015 law authorized the Peruvian Air Force to intercept suspicious aircraft entering Peruvian airspace without appropriate flight clearance authorization.  The law includes a measure that allows for lethal force in the case of non-compliance.  Though the “shoot down” policy is designed to be applied only as a last resort option, it is inconsistent with U.S. and international law prohibiting the use of lethal force against civil aircraft.  Peru published the 2018-2021 Anti-Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing National Plan in March, which includes prevention, detection, and sanctioning activities based on identified sectoral vulnerabilities.  With U.S.-provided technical assistance, Peru passed legislation creating a civil asset forfeiture regime in August.    The Ministry of Justice is implementing the New Criminal Procedure Code (NCPC), which transitions the legal system from an inquisitorial to an accusatory system.  In 2018, 31 of 34 judicial districts were operating under the NCPC, with 20 districts operating exclusively under the new system.  All 34 judicial districts are required to adjudicate corruption and organized crime cases under the NCPC.  Three districts in Lima, handling approximately 35 percent of the national caseload, will complete the transition by July 2020.  Peru and the United States have an international extradition treaty.        2.  Supply Reduction  The U.S. government estimates that 49,800 ha of coca were under cultivation in Peru in 2017, a 13 percent increase from the 2016 estimate of 44,000 ha.  The U.S. estimate for potential pure cocaine production increased from 410 MT in 2016 to 491 MT in 2017 due to coca yield and maturity.  As of September 30, CORAH eradicated 20,843 ha of its annual goal of 25,000 ha in Peru’s Ucayali, Pasco, Huánuco, and San Martín regions.  On October 10, the Peruvian government approved the VRAEM Strategy 2021, which involves heavy investment in social and economic development, but does not include eradication operations for the region that accounts for an estimated 65 percent of Peru’s total potential pure cocaine production.  DIREJANDRO received a $12.3 million budget in 2018, identical to its 2017 budget.  During the first nine months of 2018, this unit seized 39.7 MT of narcotics, including 9.6 MT of cocaine base, 17.2 MT of cocaine hydrochloride, and 12.8 MT of marijuana.  DIREJANDRO units destroyed 243 cocaine laboratories and seized 61.8 MT of coca leaf.  The movement of cocaine by small aircraft from Peru to Bolivia and Brazil remains a significant concern to the United States, even though the number of illicit drug flights remained constant in 2018.  Illicit flights continue to originate from the areas of Ciudad Constitución and the Junín-Huancavelica border zone.  Large cocaine seizures continue to occur in source zone areas and the coastal, northern border between Peru and Ecuador.  Peruvian authorities continue to see high-THC Colombian marijuana (known locally as “cripy”) enter Peru across the country’s northern border with Ecuador, for distribution in Chile.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 240   The police and military continued to destroy clandestine runways – 64 runways through September 30, 2018, compared to 78 runways in 2017.  Peruvian, Colombian, Mexican, and Eastern European traffickers maintain sophisticated networks to ship cocaine to Europe, East Asia, Mexico, the Caribbean, the United States, and other Western Hemisphere countries.  Peru and the United States undertake joint maritime operations that permit U.S. authorities to board Peruvian-flagged vessels in international waters.  In joint investigations with U.S. law enforcement, DIREJANDRO identified and disrupted major international cocaine trafficking organizations using maritime and air conveyances.    During the first nine months in 2018, PNP and Customs officials at Lima’s International Airport and the Port of Callao seized 7.1 MT of cocaine, arresting 108 smugglers.  These officials also seized 29 fraudulent passports at ports of entry.  PNP and Customs officials registered 5,136 individuals in the Biometrics Identification Transnational Migration Alert Program (BITMAP).  In May, DIREJANDRO’s Sensitive Investigative Unit executed “Operation Empresario,” which resulted in the seizure of 1.3 MT of cocaine and the arrest of 13 members of a Peruvian-Colombian drug trafficking organization that was shipping cocaine from the Port of Paita in Peru’s north.  PNP investigations resulted in the seizure of financial assets.  One case resulted in the seizure of $15 million worth of properties from a money laundering organization tied to corruption and drug trafficking.  In another case, the PNP seized $3.6 million worth of gold bullion that was destined to Swiss company Metalor from the Puno-based Minerales Del Sur company, which had prior links to laundering drug trafficking proceeds.  In July, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) signed a cooperative agreement with several Peruvian law enforcement agencies to establish vetted investigative units handling money laundering cases linked to drug trafficking.    3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Peru’s anti-drug agency (DEVIDA) estimates 200,000 Peruvians are addicted to illicit substances; 60,000 cocaine users, 130,000 marijuana users, and 10,000 users of other illicit substances.  Use of inexpensive, highly addictive coca paste is increasing.  Drug use is increasing along drug trafficking routes in midsize cities east of the Andes and in coastal transit cities.  DEVIDA’s budget for drug abuse prevention and treatment increased from $14.9 million in 2017 to $15.2 million in 2018.  Drug abuse counseling services reach over 30,000 people annually.  Public treatment facilities in Peru remain insufficient, with only 169 beds for patients.  Less than 10 percent of female addicts seek and receive drug treatment.  Mental health hospitals added 22 beds for inpatient drug treatment and mental disorder services for women, bringing the total number of beds for women to 42 nationwide.  DEVIDA and the Ministry of Health (MINSA) operate 162 mental health and drug services facilities used by over 15,000 patients.  Peru has approximately 400 privately run therapeutic community centers, but only 24 meet public health \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 241  legal standards.  MINSA opened 55 community mental health centers, bringing the total to 77 nationwide.  Of Peru’s 66 prisons nationwide, few offer drug treatment and rehabilitation programs.   4.  Corruption  The Government of Peru does not encourage or facilitate the illicit production or distribution of drugs.  Corruption is widespread, eroding faith in Peru’s institutions and damaging Peru’s generally positive investment climate.  According to October 2018 polling, 94 percent of Peruvians think there is high-level corruption in Congress, the Judiciary, the Attorney General’s Office, regional governments, and the PNP.  Corruption scandals have ensnarled many of Peru’s political figures, including former presidents, members of Congress, Supreme Court justices, National Magistrate’s Council representatives, and ministry officials.    Peru approved the 2018-2021 National Plan on Integrity and Combating Corruption in April, which calls for the development of OECD-recommended activities to address public corruption.  President Vizcarra approved measures to strengthen integrity and combat corruption, including the creation of the Public Integrity Secretariat, the implementation of centers to report corruption, and a requirement of high-level officials to issue sworn statements on conflicts of interest.  In July, the Peruvian government passed a legislative decree that would bar public officials from holding government positions when they have committed certain crimes.  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States funds projects to support Peru’s drug control strategy through training, technical assistance, capacity-building, intelligence, and the targeted provision of equipment.  The United States and Peru jointly finance manual coca eradication and alternative development efforts.  The United States provides aviation support to eradication and interdiction activities.  While Peru has not made the decision to commence eradication operations in the VRAEM, the PNP has increased interdiction operations there with DEA assistance.    In communities where alternative development followed eradication, coca cultivation dropped by just less than 90 percent using 2016 data provided by the UN Office on Drugs and Crime.  With technical and institutional assistance from the United States, DEVIDA invested $29 million in 2018 towards alternative development.  In 2018, U.S.-supported alternative development efforts generated an estimated 30,000 new jobs, assisted 41,439 families, and supported these families in the planting, maintenance, and improvement of 75,620 ha of cacao and coffee.  U.S. support to the PNP helped to enhance law enforcement capabilities and support citizen security.  Interdiction programs increased seizures of illicit drugs and precursor chemicals.  The U.S.-supported Model Police Station Program focuses on community policing in five Callao neighborhoods, and has led to a 39 percent reduction in crime since 2015.  The United States is supporting the PNP’s educational reform project by assisting with the establishment of a specialized criminal investigations academy, which will include a virtual shooting range, forensic laboratories, and a simulation courtroom.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 242   The U.S.-supported Ports and Custom’s Program worked with the PNP’s Precursor Chemicals Investigation Divisions (DIVICDIQ) and the National Superintendence of Customs and Taxes (SUNAT) to establish a Joint Tactical Taskforce that processes interagency intelligence products to conduct viable checkpoint operations in high-risk areas, such as the VRAEM.  The program provided capacity-building initiatives to enhance the operational effectiveness of PNP and SUNAT officials, including trainings on canine operations, drug concealment methods, imposter detection, and passenger risk analysis.  The program continued its work with the Tactical Command Center, the Immigration Intelligence Unit, and BITMAP.  The United States continued to collaborate with the American Bar Association’s Rule of Law Initiative in 2018 to support Peru’s transition to the accusatory system with training to judicial operators.  The United States also sponsored Peruvian judges to attend the Department of Justice’s Judicial Studies Institute and provided specialized trainings on illegal mining and anticorruption investigations.    To support treatment and recovery for persons suffering from drug addiction, the United States sponsored the Guiding the Recovery of Women (GROW) Training Program to certify trainers on specialized drug treatment for female patients.  In total, 1,200 healthcare professionals have received GROW training.  To improve the quality of services for Peru’s LGBTI community, the United States initiated the Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity specialized drug treatment training course in October for 45 healthcare professionals and civil society leaders.  In coordination with the OAS and DEVIDA, the United States also initiated an adolescent drug treatment court pilot project and supported the launch of a school-based drug prevention project.  The United States continued a mentoring project in 2018 to assist Peru to increase asset forfeiture convictions.  The project has led to 36 asset forfeiture convictions and sentences.  The United States assisted specialized prosecutorial units on environmental crimes to strengthen their investigations into transnational criminal organizations’ involvement in illegal mining and logging.  The United States also supported the Public Ministry’s Office of Strategic Criminal Analysis, which supports active organized crime cases.  D.  Conclusion  President Vizcarra demonstrates the political will to address drug production and trafficking.  In 2018, Peru increased resources to treat vulnerable populations afflicted by illegal substance abuse.  The U.S. partnership with Peru to implement its drug control strategy remains critical; however, both sides should work toward implementing robust counterdrug efforts in the VRAEM, to include eradication, interdiction, and alternative development.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 243  Philippines  A. Introduction  The Philippines remains a regional transit and destination point for illicit drug trafficking, particularly for methamphetamine and its precursors from China.  “Shabu” (the local street name of methamphetamine hydrochloride) and marijuana rank respectively as the first and second most widely consumed drugs in the Philippines.  Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte’s antidrug campaign continued to receive domestic and international scrutiny due to accusations of “extra-judicial killings” by police and vigilante groups.  To date, more than 1.3 million individuals have surrendered to authorities, as key government entities have taken steps to intensify implementation of both supply and demand reduction programs.  Nonetheless, drug trafficking remained a highly lucrative illicit business with limited risks due to systemic poverty, ineffective criminal justice institutions, outdated drug control laws, poorly controlled maritime borders, and public corruption.    B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1.  Institutional Development  Due to the administration’s prioritization of efforts to combat illicit drug production, trafficking, and use, multiple government agencies took steps to amplify drug control engagement in 2018.  Limited financial, human, and technical resources and competing bureaucratic interests hampered effective policy coordination.  The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 designates the Dangerous Drugs Board (DDB) under the Office of the President as the country’s lead policy and strategy-making body on drug control and prevention.  During 2018, the DDB benefited from strong leadership that sought to implement a comprehensive, multi-sector approach to reduce both supply and demand.  The Dangerous Drugs Act also created the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) as the DDB’s implementing arm and lead law enforcement agency for drug control.    With an executive order issued by President Duterte in 2017, the Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency took over as chair of the Interagency Committee on Anti-Illegal Drugs, a newly established 21-agency body created to implement drug policy under four clusters: enforcement; justice; advocacy; and rehabilitation and reintegration.  The PDEA effectively collaborated with the DDB on drug control and prevention in 2018.  Other executive branch entities, the judiciary, and local government units played an increasingly important role in drug control policy, though these efforts were at times disjointed and uncoordinated.  In order to bring together these multiple efforts under one comprehensive strategy, the Dangerous Drugs Board drafted a Philippine Anti-Drug Strategy, which was formally approved by President Duterte via executive order on October 29.  Implementation on this strategy will begin in early 2019.    The use of plea bargains in drug cases resumed after the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a 2002 provision barring their use in late 2017.  However, inadequate coordination between the treatment facilities, law enforcement, and the judiciary have challenged the plea bargain’s effective implementation.  Restrictions imposed by the 1965 Anti-Wiretapping \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 244  Act, which bars the use of intercepted criminal communications in court, remained in place.  The Philippines are party to both an extradition treaty and a mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States, and regularly coordinates extradition and mutual legal assistance requests.  Cooperation is excellent, although bureaucratic procedures slow execution of the requests.  The Philippines maintains a cooperative relationship with international partners, including the United States, on transnational drug interdictions and demand reduction.    2.  Supply Reduction  According to the PDEA, trafficking organizations use critical entry points (68 major seaports; 11 international airports; a 22,548-mile coastline; and the mail and parcel system) for both transshipment and drop-off points to smuggle drug shipments.  Most high-volume drug smuggling cases involve foreign nationals.  Chinese drug syndicates dominate the illegal drug trade through bulk smuggling via cargo ships and foreign-flagged fishing vessels, according to Philippine authorities.  These organizations have also established clandestine laboratories and illegal chemical warehouses in key locations throughout the Philippines.  Authorities also note evidence of drug syndicates operating from Africa and Latin America.  Philippine authorities have conducted operations against both international drug syndicates and local dealers.  During the first 10 months of 2018, the PDEA conducted 25,467 counterdrug operations, which dismantled four clandestine methamphetamine laboratories and led to the arrest of 23,749 individuals.  The government addresses the negligible cannabis cultivation through a pilot alternative development program in Cebu, La Union, and Kalinga.  Trafficking organizations commonly utilize multiple simultaneous shipments in the belief that authorities would catch some but not all of the illicit shipments.  For example, on August 7, a joint Bureau of Customs and Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency operation seized 355 kilograms of shabu (with an estimated street value of $63 million) from two magnetic scrap lifters originating from Malaysia at the Manila International Container Port (MICT).  However, on August 8, authorities discovered four already empty identical lifters of the same origin suspected to have contained $127 million in shabu.  The Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency later issued a statement indicating that large amounts of shabu seized from between July and October contain the same “synthetic impurities” and “production methods” as the shipment interdicted at the MICT.    3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  The government currently estimates that 4.7 million individuals are involved in either the use or trafficking of drugs.  The DDB conducted the most recent nationwide survey of drug use in 2015, which revealed the majority of drug users are male, employed adults (18-59 years old) with a high school education.  The top three drugs by use are methamphetamine, marijuana, and (to a lesser extent) cocaine.  Injection continues to rise as a method of drug use increasing exposure to other risk factors such as Hepatitis C and HIV/AIDS.    In 2018, the government’s counterdrug strategy increasingly incorporated drug demand reduction programs.  Key agencies in government, such as the DDB, the PDEA, the Departments \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 245  of Interior and Local Government, Health, Education, and Social Welfare, and local officials are working to incorporate drug treatment, prevention, and rehabilitation efforts that are evidence-based and appropriate in a local context.  Civil society and the faith-based community are highly active in drug demand reduction in the Philippines and work with government and law enforcement officials, when appropriate, to develop solutions to address the country’s drug problem.  DDB’s new antidrug strategy aims to bring these activities under one national approach.    4.  Corruption  As a matter of public policy, the Government of the Philippines does not encourage or facilitate any illegal activity related to drug trafficking.  However, endemic corruption is present at multiple levels of government and there are frequent allegations of public officials linked to drug trafficking.  The Comprehensive Dangerous Drugs Act of 2002 imposes criminal penalties for government officials found to have benefited from drug trafficking proceeds.    C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   Cooperation between the Philippines and the United States related to drug policy strengthened in 2018 through ongoing transnational interdiction assistance efforts and a new bilateral agreement designed to increase Philippine capability to reduce drug use through prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation.  With this assistance, the United States has supported Philippine government officials, including law enforcement, with developing evidence-based prevention and treatment protocols.  U.S. assistance has supported the interdiction of methamphetamine shipments to the Philippines through parcel services from California in collaboration with PDEA’s Airport Interagency Drug Interdiction Task Group.  U.S. assistance is also working with the Philippine government to expand the provision and access to justice.    D. Conclusion  Complementing the surge in enforcement actions that took place in 2017, 2018 saw significant expansion in government drug demand reduction efforts.  As these efforts continue to expand across multiple sectors, key government authorities will need to ensure these programs are complementary and evidence-based.  Expansion in treatment accessibility, plea bargain agreements, and community-based services could provide an effective alternative to pretrial detention for low-level drug offenders in overcrowded detention facilities.  Enforcement actions could be further complemented through better collaboration between law enforcement and prosecutors in order to identify, investigate, and prosecute transnational criminal organizations.      \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 246  Russia  Russia remains a major destination country for heroin and other Afghan opiates.  Smuggled opiates are primarily trafficked into Russia through Central Asian countries.  Other illicit drugs, including cocaine, are typically smuggled into the country via St. Petersburg and Black Sea ports by drug couriers or concealed within maritime shipments originating largely in the Caribbean region and South America.  The Ministry of Internal Affairs (MVD) and the Federal Security Service (FSB) are Russia’s two federal agencies responsible for drug-related investigations.  In October 2017, the availability of synthetic drugs surpassed heroin in the Russian drug market.  The MVD has reported targeting synthetic drugs sold via the internet and non-indexed internet sites (“Dark Web”).  In September 2017, authorities effectively shut down the Russian Anonymous Marketplace, a Dark Web hub featuring over 1,300 websites selling illicit drugs.  In 2017, the most recent year for which statistics are available, Russian law enforcement seized 24.4 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs.  Of this total amount, 977.3 kilograms were opiates; 5.6 MT were synthetic drugs; 14.3 MT were cannabis products; and 437.3 kilograms were psychotropic substances.  In 2016, the government disbanded the Federal Narcotics Control Service (FSKN) and assigned its functions largely to the MVD, which absorbed many of FSKN’s employees.  Since December 2016, Minister of Internal Affairs Vladimir Kolokoltsev has served as Chair of the State Anti-Drug Committee, which coordinates Russia’s drug control policy.  The Ministries of Health and Labor assumed responsibility for drug user rehabilitation and Ministries of Health and Education for prevention of drug use.  In February 2018, President Putin introduced amendments to the National Anti-Drug Policy Strategy confirming the MVD’s coordinating role.  The MVD took over management of illicit drug statistical information, but released less data as compared with its predecessor.   According to the MVD State Anti-Drug Committee’s report for 2017, there were 2.2 million drug users and 208,681 drug crimes registered in Russia.  MVD detected 7,179 drug crimes committed through the internet in 2017.  Drug addiction in Russia is typically not treated according to evidence-based modern protocols, and is often treated with antipsychotic drugs suited to treat schizophrenia.  Experts from civil society have also criticized Russian addiction treatment and rehabilitation programs due to poor interagency and inter-sectoral cooperation, and for the lack of a cohesive national rehabilitation program.  In 2013, Russia terminated its letter of agreement with the United States that funded counterdrug capacity-building programs.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has a well-established robust relationship with all host-country counterparts, including the MVD, FSB, Federal Customs Services, Moscow City Police, and General Prosecutor’s Office.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 247  Senegal  Historically, Senegal’s location and transportation infrastructure have made it a transit point for the movement of illicit drugs from West Africa to Europe, mostly cocaine.  International trafficking networks have utilized Senegalese fishing vessels to smuggle cocaine shipments into and through the country, according to law enforcement reports.  In 2018, however, both maritime and land-based trafficking activity through Senegal appeared to diminish, perhaps due to an increase in direct maritime and aerial transshipment from South America to Europe.  Locally, cannabis is cultivated in the southern Casamance region for domestic use and to supply markets across West Africa.  Seizures of multi-ton quantities of marijuana continued in 2018, but the bulk of these actions occurred in the northern part of Senegal and involved truck-borne cannabis shipments from southern Mali.  Senegal’s 1997 Drug Law was amended in 2006 with tougher penalties for drug trafficking.  Senegal’s latest drug control plan, launched in 2017, aims to reduce the cultivation, production, and trafficking of illicit drugs, as well as to inform the population of the dangers of illicit drug use, and promote the rehabilitation of persons with substance use disorders.  As of 2018, the effectiveness of the plan remains unproven.  While Senegal continues to lack the resources to reliably identify and seize illicit drugs, the capacity and professionalism of Senegalese authorities are slowly improving, particularly with assistance from international partners.  Senegal collaborates with partners from the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to combat drug trafficking.  For example, in September 2018, the Senegalese National Police and the Drug Law Enforcement Agency of The Gambia signed a memorandum of understanding to increase coordination and collaboration on drug enforcement issues.  In 2018, the United States continued to provide assistance to strengthen the capacities of the Gendarmerie, the Marine Nationale, and the Senegalese National Police to monitor, detect, and interdict drug traffickers in Senegal’s maritime approaches and territory.  The United States and Senegal do not currently have a bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty or an extradition treaty, but Senegalese government has asked that that treaties be negotiated in the future.  Senegal is a party to multilateral law enforcement conventions that have mutual legal assistance provisions.  The Government of Senegal has the political will to fight drug trafficking, but limited infrastructure and funding impede its efforts.  Incremental improvement is taking place, but continued support from the United States and other international partners remains critical.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 248  Serbia  Serbia is not a significant source or consumer country of illicit drugs but remains a transit area for drugs smuggled through its territory to other European markets, including opiates originating in Afghanistan and cocaine originating in South America.  Some small clandestine laboratories produce synthetic drugs within the country for local use, and cannabis is the most widely used illicit drug domestically.  Amphetamine-type stimulants and new psychoactive substances (NPS) are produced in small quantities in clandestine labs throughout Serbia (primarily synthetic cannabinoids).  These drugs are mainly exported to Western Europe and the Middle East, but also supply a small but growing domestic market.  In 2018, seizures of cocaine, marijuana, and amphetamines decreased, while seizures of heroin increased by 12 percent.  The Ministry of Interior (MOI) reported that drugs continue to be trafficked along the “Balkan Route” into Europe, primarily entering Serbia from Kosovo and Albania, with Serbian drug trafficking groups facilitating logistics.  While Serbian authorities believe heroin and MDMA (ecstasy) use is declining within the country, NPS use is believed to be rising.  According to the Ministry of Interior’s (MOI) Counter-Narcotics Unit, fentanyl, fentanyl analogues, and ketamine have not been detected in Serbia, and precursor chemical diversion through the country has not been significant.  To better monitor the importation of possible precursor chemicals, Serbia’s 2005 Law on Precursor Drugs is being amended to require more stringent licenses and permits to better track the use of the chemicals.     Serbia established the MOI Service for Abuse of Drugs and Drug Trafficking in 2014, which is responsible for drug-related investigations and addiction prevention programs.  Treatment and prevention of drug addiction is mainly the responsibility of the Ministry of Health, but nongovernmental organizations also provide services.  Bigger cities such as Belgrade, Nis, and Novi Sad have police units dedicated to curbing the use of illicit drugs and investigating drug-related crimes.  Serbian law enforcement has been shifting to a more centralized approach by creating a database of criminals and investigations that can be accessed by all 27 departments throughout the country.    The United States provides ongoing assistance to the MOI to support criminal justice capacity building.  The Serbian government also seeks to amplify its cooperation with regional partners to address drug trafficking throughout the Western Balkans, in line with European Union standards.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 249  Spain  Spain is a leading transit point in Europe for cocaine originating from South America and for hashish from Morocco.  Cocaine arrives in Spain in large containerized shipments and in lower-volume shipments via recreational boats, sailboats, and within parasitic devices attached to cargo ships.  Transnational criminal organizations frequently traffic cocaine mixed within cargo to avoid detection.  Domestic illicit drug production is minor, although there are a small number of indoor cannabis cultivation operations and clandestine labs involved in cutting, mixing, and reconstituting cocaine and heroin.  The drug control efforts of Spanish authorities have resulted in record-breaking drug seizures, utilizing strong border control and coastal monitoring; sophisticated geospatial detection technology; domestic police action; internal affairs investigations; and international cooperation.  In 2017, the most recent year for which data is available, Spain seized and destroyed a record 477 metric tons (MT) of illicit drugs.  The volume of seized cocaine more than doubled from 2016, totaling 40.96 MT in 2017.  Heroin seizures more than doubled to 524 kilograms.  In April 2018, Spanish authorities seized nearly nine MT of cocaine at the port of Algeciras, hidden in a shipment of bananas.  This was the largest cocaine seizure in European history.  In July 2018, Spain arrested 10 Algeciras stevedores who were working with drug cartels to facilitate trafficking through the port.  In February 2018, the Spanish government approved a 2017-24 national strategy to fight drug addiction.  The strategy prioritizes equal access to treatment for minors, women, and the elderly.  Spanish authorities estimate that 9.5 percent of Spaniards consume cannabis and two percent consume cocaine.    Spain continued to enjoy excellent bilateral and multilateral law enforcement cooperation with international partners in 2018.  Cooperation on EU operations in the Mediterranean continued, and U.S. law enforcement agencies maintained strong working relationships with Spanish police and customs authorities, leading to significant drug seizures and arrests.  November 2018, Spain’s parliament approved new legislation to ban certain small high-speed watercraft from Spanish waters.  The law provides for the creation of a registry for exempted boats of this type – which are frequently used to smuggle illicit drugs, especially in the vicinity of the Strait of Gibraltar – and permits Spanish customs to seize unregistered ships regardless of whether drugs or other contraband are found onboard.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 250  Suriname  A.  Introduction   Suriname is a transit zone for South American cocaine en route to Europe, Africa, and, to a lesser extent, the United States.  Cargo containers carry most illicit drugs smuggled through Suriname, but smaller fishing vessels, commercial and private air transport, and human couriers also conceal cocaine.  Suriname’s sparsely populated coastal region and isolated jungle interior, together with weak border controls and infrastructure, make illicit drug detection and interdiction efforts difficult.  There is little evidence of illicit drug production within Suriname.   B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development   The Government of Suriname is officially opposed to illicit drug trafficking, but Suriname’s practical ability to apprehend and prosecute drug traffickers remains inhibited by drug-related corruption, bureaucratic hurdles, and the lack of financial and material resources.  The Suriname Police Force (KPS) is responsible for detecting and combating drug-related activities with five units having specific drug control responsibilities.  The KPS Narcotics Unit investigates and arrests individuals involved in trafficking illicit drugs, and the Narcotics Intelligence Unit gathers intelligence related to illegal drug trafficking.  At the country’s major international airport, the Combating International Drug Trafficking Unit (BID) screens passengers on outbound flights.  The BID team receives training from international experts, and is assisted by a canine unit for inspecting luggage.   The Container Control Unit (CCP) is the fifth unit with specific drug control responsibilities.  It uses risk analysis and other proactive techniques to systematically target high-risk containers.  The government replaced all members of the U.S.-funded, UN-implemented Container Control Unit at the Terminal of Jules Sedney Haven (Port of Paramaribo) in August 2018.  The Unit’s operating protocol requires permission and oversight of Surinamese Customs authorities during inspections.  The Ministry of Justice and Police included the creation of an Integrated Security Plan in the 2019 draft budget.  Under the plan, police, military, and the Directorate of National Security would intensify cooperation on a variety of security issues, including combatting the trafficking of illicit drugs and strengthening technical investigation skills.    Drug prevention and control activities are coordinated by Suriname’s National Drug Master Plan, developed under the aegis of the National Antidrug Board.  This document is supposed to be developed every five years, but the most recent plan expired in 2015.  The Government of Suriname reported that a new plan for the period 2018-2022 was near completion at the end of 2018.  Suriname is a party to the Inter-American Convention against Corruption and Migrant Smuggling and the Inter-American Convention on Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters.  Since \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 251  1976, Suriname has shared drug-related information with the Netherlands as part of a mutual legal assistance agreement among former Dutch colonies to exchange crime-related data.  Suriname has also signed bilateral agreements to combat drug trafficking with Brazil, Venezuela, and Colombia.  A comprehensive bilateral maritime counterdrug enforcement agreement between the United States and Suriname has been in force since 1999.  Suriname does not have a mutual legal assistance agreement or extradition treaty in place with the United States.    2.  Supply Reduction  Suriname is not a source country for illicit drugs or precursor chemicals, but it continues to be a transshipment point for illicit drugs.  During the first nine months of 2018, Surinamese authorities seized approximately 648 kilograms (kg) of cocaine; 16.4 liters of liquid cocaine; 569.1 kg of marijuana; 875 grams of hashish; 524 grams of MDMA (ecstasy) powder; and 504 MDMA tablets.  Authorities seized less cocaine, but more marijuana and MDMA compared to the first three quarters of 2017.  With support from U.S. authorities, Surinamese law enforcement agencies seized a self-propelled semi-submersible vessel in Saramacca on March 1, 2018, the first ever seized in Suriname.  Local authorities seized a Cessna 210 aircraft containing 488 kg of cocaine two weeks later.  The Attorney General’s Office received 139 drug-related cases from police for additional investigation and brought 71 cases to court.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment   Illicit drug use is relatively rare in Suriname, with marijuana being the primary drug consumed locally.  Police have warned of growing use of MDMA in powder form (locally called “sukru”) as a party drug.  There is one government-run detoxification center, and other treatment centers are run by non-governmental organizations.  The government’s National Antidrug Board (NAR) continued awareness activities including meeting with drug prevention and treatment stakeholders.      4.  Corruption   As a policy matter, the Government of Suriname does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking.  However, widespread and credible allegations suggest that corruption pervades many government offices and that corruption has influenced the government’s investigation of some cases.  The National Parliament passed an anti-corruption law in September 2017.  President Desire Bouterse had not signed the act into force as of October 2018.  The Minister of Justice and Police announced his intention to create an integrity commission after 10 police officers were arrested, five on narcotics-related charges, in a span of three weeks.   Local criminal investigations and prosecutions of alleged corrupt acts are rare.  However, in October a court convicted and sentenced a customs officer to nine months in prison and a customs broker to two months in prison in one of the largest drug trafficking cases of 2017, an attempt to smuggle 395 kg by shipping container.  Courts in the Netherlands, France, and the United States convicted senior government officials of drug trafficking in previous reporting periods. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 252   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives   The United States supports a range of efforts designed to address crime and violence in Suriname, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially reduce illicit trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  CBSI support to Suriname includes training and equipment, primarily to the KPS and justice sector actors, to prevent and interdict drug trafficking, enhance border enforcement capabilities, and combat money laundering.  Recent changes to weaken the structure of KPS support for drug control efforts, if not remedied, will complicate U.S.-Suriname bilateral efforts.  D.  Conclusion  Suriname continues to be a transit country for illicit drugs originating in South America.  The United States encourages the Government of Suriname to combat corruption and take further steps to increase the effectiveness of drug interdiction efforts within the country, as well as subsequent investigations and prosecutions.  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 253  Tajikistan  A.  Introduction    Tajikistan sits astride one of several illicit drug trafficking routes for opiates and cannabis leaving Afghanistan en route to markets in Russia and Eastern Europe, and to a lesser extent, Central Asia.  Known as the “Northern Route,” a 2018 United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime report estimates that between 2011 and 2015, 44 to 74 metric tons of heroin transited the route annually, the bulk of which is believed to have transited Tajikistan to the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan.  During the same period, Tajikistan accounted for 34 percent of all opiate seizures in Central Asia.  However, the actual amounts seized compared to the estimated flows trafficked through the country were strikingly low.   After several years of decline, the first nine months of 2018 saw an increase in opiate seizures in Tajikistan.  It remains unclear whether the increase is directly linked to an increase in heroin production resulting from the record opium crop in Afghanistan in 2017.  As in past years, the number of registered drug users in the country (primarily heroin users) remains relatively unchanged; however, that may be more a result of the way individuals are enrolled in the program than indicative of a stable drug-use population.  Anecdotal information indicates the price of street-level heroin increased substantially in 2018 as availability may have declined.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development   Tajikistan’s drug investigative and interdiction agencies are capable and have the needed legislative tools.  U.S. law enforcement authorities cooperate well with their Tajik counterparts on drug cases, but Tajikistan’s focus appears to be on the domestic market rather than interdicting drugs transiting to foreign markets.  This issue is exacerbated by a lack of feedback and information sharing by other international partners.    In 2018, U.S. government drug control assistance focused on Tajikistan’s Drug Control Agency under the President of Tajikistan (DCA) and supported training, equipment and infrastructure projects.    Tajikistan does not have an extradition or mutual legal assistance treaty with the United States, though Tajikistan is party to multilateral conventions that enable law enforcement cooperation.   2.  Supply Reduction    According to statistics provided by the DCA, the total volume of all illicit drug seized during the first nine months of 2018 was approximately 3.27 metric tons, a three percent decrease from the same period in 2017.  The decline is attributed to a 42 percent decline in the amount of hashish and cannabis interdicted.  However, opiate seizures increased overall by 42 percent, with 201 \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 254  kilograms (kg) and 1,313 kg of heroin and opium seized, respectively.  When compared to the same period in 2017, heroin seizures increased by 74 percent, while seized opium increased by 38 percent.  The reason given for the increase in opiate seizures according to government officials was the large opium crop in Afghanistan, which they believed resulted in an increase in heroin manufacture and export.  All agencies involved in drug interdiction or investigation saw increases in opiate seizures, while simultaneously seeing a decline in cannabis seizures.  During the first nine months of 2018, over 15,500 MDMA (ecstasy) tablets were seized, a significant increase compared to 2017.  Tajik authorities estimated that the street price per kilogram of heroin from January to July increased from $7,000 to $8,000, while the kilogram price of opium during that period declined from $1,600 to $1,200.  There were 266 kg of the precursor chemical acetic anhydride seized in 2018.  Historically, the Northern Route has not been a conduit for precursors entering Afghanistan, the ultimate destination for the chemical.       3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  There are 6,888 registered persons with substance use disorders in Tajikistan, down slightly from the 6,930 in 2017.  Individuals can elect to register for five years, which means their number remains relatively stable year to year.  Being registered is a last resort for most users, since it denies the use government employment, a driver’s license and, because a marriage permit requires a drug test, the ability to marry.  However, if they elect to, registration allows intravenous drug users to receive methadone through internationally funded HIV prevention projects.    A recent U.S. government funded survey estimated there were between 29,000 and 50,000 intravenous drug users in Tajikistan.  Anecdotal information indicates that street-level heroin was harder to obtain in 2018, with the dosage-unit price increasing substantially in the past year, forcing low-income addicts to find other drugs, generally less expensive and easily obtained prescription pain killers.  Opium is abused more than heroin.  Crystal methamphetamine is available, but its higher price limits its use to the wealthy.  New psychoactive substances have yet to make an impact on the local drug market.    4.  Corruption   In stated policy, the Government of Tajikistan does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking.  In April 2018, the deputy head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs drug investigation section was arrested for soliciting a bribe.  Under a 2016 law, he was convicted in October, fined $8,700, released, and ordered by the court to return the approximately $19,700 bribe he received.  That law was amended in mid-2018, making imprisonment mandatory for future cases.  Extremely low salaries for state workers, the profitability of illegal drugs, and the dearth of other profitable business options all contribute to corruption within the country’s counterdrug forces.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 255  C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives    During the first nine months of 2018, the U.S. government contributed or dedicated $4.9 million in assistance to Tajikistan’s drug control efforts.  The aid consisted of training, buildings, equipment and other expenses.  Most of the assistance focused on the DCA, the principal drug enforcement organization in the country.  The U.S. government has a strong relationship with the DCA.  D.  Conclusion   After years of decline, increased seizures are a positive indicator of effort, but seizures still remain very low as a percentage of the estimated amount of drugs transiting Tajikistan.  The increase in price and drop in availability of heroin at the street level may result from increased effectiveness of law enforcement conducting local investigations.  However, there may be other factors influencing availability.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 256  Tanzania  Tanzania is a significant transit country for illicit drugs.  Domestic drug use is also increasing.  Tanzania-based trafficking organizations and courier networks operate globally, and play a prominent role in the Southwest Asian heroin trade.  In 2018, Tanzanian courts convicted and upheld convictions of numerous drug traffickers.  During the year, Tanzanian authorities demonstrated increased interdiction capacity with several seizures resulting from authorities’ quick response to real time intelligence.  In several incidents, Tanzanian citizens were arrested for narcotics trafficking in various African and Asian countries.    Tanzania’s geographical location, prevalence of corruption, and porous borders present considerable challenges to drug interdiction.  Traffickers exploit Tanzania’s 854 mile coastline and inadequate security at Tanzanian seaports.  Southwest Asian heroin is transported in multi-hundred kilogram quantities by small vessels to Zanzibar and the Tanzanian coastline.  Large quantities of heroin transit Tanzania’s land border with Kenya for transshipment to Europe and North America.  Smaller amounts (three to five kilograms) are trafficked to Europe, India, and North America from Dar es Salaam via commercial flights and air cargo.  South American cocaine is trafficked into Tanzania by air for further international distribution.  Tanzania produces cannabis and khat for domestic consumption and regional distribution.  The Tanzanian Drug Control and Enforcement Authority (DCEA), the Tanzania Intelligence and Security Service (TISS), the Tanzanian Police Service’s Anti-Narcotics Unit, the Tanzanian Peoples Defence Force (TPDF), and Tanzanian Maritime Police contribute to Tanzania’s fight against illicit drug trafficking.  These agencies work with U.S. and other international law enforcement partners.  Regional cooperation on drug interdiction is improving.  Extradition between Tanzania and the United States is governed by the 1931 U.S.-U.K. Extradition Treaty.  There is no bilateral mutual legal assistance treaty between Tanzania and the United States, though both countries are parties to various multilateral conventions with provisions for assistance.  The Government of Tanzania does not encourage or facilitate the production or trafficking of illicit drugs as a matter of policy, but corruption remains a barrier to effective enforcement.  Drug traffickers use their considerable financial resources to influence politicians, law enforcement officers, and others in positions of power.   The United States promotes improved interdiction operations through law enforcement cooperation and by encouraging a strong Tanzanian government commitment to drug interdiction, combatting corruption, and improving criminal justice and rule of law. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 257  Thailand  A.  Introduction  Thailand remains a drug transit route for trafficking to international markets, and domestic drug use is a significant challenge.  Thailand does not cultivate or produce any significant quantities of opiates, methamphetamine, or other illicit drugs.  Various transnational criminal organizations continue to exploit Thailand as a destination and transit country for heroin and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) originating from Myanmar, specifically methamphetamine.    According to the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, the Thai government has not reported eradicating opium poppy since 2013.  However, in 2017, the Thai Office of Narcotics Control Board (ONCB) reported that approximately 1.97 metric tons (MT) of opium poppy plants were seized during the first six months of 2017, compared to 662.2 kilograms (kg) during all of 2016.  Heroin seizures have increased in Thailand since a significant drop in 2015, and methamphetamine seizures have also increased since 2016.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1.  Institutional Development  The Narcotics Act 2522 (1979) and the Psychotropic Substances Act 2518 (1975) are the primary laws relating to drug offenses in Thailand.  The Narcotics Control Board (NCB) has overall responsibility for the prevention and suppression of illegal drug use.  The Act on Measures for the Suppression of Offenders in an Offence Relating to Narcotics 2534 (1991) provides for asset seizure related to drug trafficking cases.  Criminal penalties vary by narcotics classification, generally ranging from the imposition of fines to life imprisonment.  Thai law provides for capital punishment for those convicted of possession of more than 20 grams of Schedule I substances with “intent to sell” though the death penalty is not commonly imposed; the last reported execution of a drug offender was in 2009.  Thailand has bilateral extradition and mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States.  Thailand is an effective and cooperative partner, with U.S. assistance facilitating and enhancing that cooperation.   2.  Supply Reduction   Methamphetamine production and trafficking by non-state armed groups and other regional producers in neighboring Burma remains a serious challenge for Thailand.  Thai authorities estimate that 90 percent of the crystal methamphetamine smuggled into Thailand enters across the Burma border.  While a portion of the methamphetamine is intended for the domestic Thai market, most of it is trafficked to other Asian markets.  A notable amount is trafficked south from Thailand into Malaysia.  Seizures were at record levels in 2018.  Between January and September, Thailand seized approximately 12.97 MT of crystal methamphetamine, compared to a total of 7.61 MT total during all of 2017.  Thailand is similarly on track to surpass record high seizure totals of methamphetamine tablets (“yaba”) from 2017.  As of September 2018, Thailand \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 258  had seized 222 million yaba tablets compared to 239.9 million total tablets during all of 2017.  Despite the uptick in seizures, the price of yaba has decreased by approximately 40-50 percent in the Bangkok metropolitan area, suggesting an expansion in supply.  Similar to the methamphetamine trade, heroin supplies trafficked through Thailand also originates largely from Burma.  Thai authorities report the involvement of West African crime syndicates that use Thai nationals (generally females) to carry drugs onward to China, Malaysia, and other regional markets.  Heroin seizures remained largely stable in 2018.  During the first nine months of 2018, Thai authorities reported seizing 570 kg of heroin, compared to 593 kg during same period in 2017.   MDMA (known locally as “ya-E” or “ecstasy”) is typically smuggled into Thailand from Malaysia.  Domestic use is trending upward, but is largely confined to Bangkok and other tourist areas.  Tablets remain relatively expensive with a street price ranging from $12-18.  As of September 2018, Thai authorities had seized 187,163 tablets.   Cocaine trafficking and abuse remains limited in the domestic market.  Annual cocaine seizures are generally around 50 kg and have never exceeded 70 kg.  During the first nine months of 2018, Thai authorities seized approximately 22 kg of cocaine.  Thai authorities attribute most cocaine trafficking to West African crime syndicates, which largely smuggle cocaine from South America via air transport.  Marijuana continues to be readily available throughout Thailand and the region.  Though limited quantities of cannabis are cultivated domestically, most of the marijuana seized in Thailand originates from Laos.  Marijuana seizures are trending downward.  Through September 2018, Thai authorities had seized a total of 13.19 MT, compared to an average of 30 MT in previous years.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Substance abuse has been a high-profile social and public health problem in Thailand for decades.  According to press reporting and academic studies, an estimated three million people between the ages of 12-65 years old, or 5.8 percent of the total population, have used at least one illegal addictive substance at some point in their lives.  Thailand carries out comprehensive demand reduction programs, combining drug use prevention programs with treatment for those suffering from substance use disorders.  Drug treatment and rehabilitation is offered at hospitals, as well as some military camps, temples, and mosques. Methadone use is approved for detoxification treatment under the national health coverage.    4.  Corruption   Official corruption remains a challenge in Thailand and the sale of illicit drugs is sometimes facilitated by complicit law enforcement officers.  As a matter of policy, though, the Thai government does not permit, encourage, or facilitate illicit production or distribution of narcotic/psychotropic drugs or other controlled substances, or the laundering of drug proceeds, by individuals or government agencies.  Thai authorities frequently prosecute corrupt officials. \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 259   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States and Thailand enjoy a strong cooperative relationship on law enforcement matters.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and other federal law enforcement agencies continued to work closely with their Thai counterparts on coordinated investigations in 2018.  Thailand is one of several countries in which DEA maintains Sensitive Investigative Units (SIUs).  Thai SIU participants receive specialized training and undergo a rigorous vetting process.  Additionally, the United States provides a stream of training and assistance to Thai law enforcement and criminal justice entities specific to drug trafficking.  Through the International Law Enforcement Academy and other programs, the United States and Thailand are working to enhance regional cooperation to combat transnational crime.  The United States also provides training and other assistance to Thai customs officials, Thai Maritime Police, and other law enforcement authorities to improve border protection and investigation skills.  Thailand uses U.S.-developed curriculum to support training and professionalization of its substance treatment workforce.  With U.S. support, the program is establishing a cadre of national trainers who will disseminate the training throughout the country.  D.  Conclusion   The U.S. government enjoys a particularly close and collaborative relationship with Thai law enforcement.  The United States will continue to assist the Thai government to promote greater cooperation between its police and prosecutors, prevent corruption, and further advance regional drug control cooperation.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 260  Trinidad and Tobago  A.  Introduction  Trinidad and Tobago is a twin-island nation in the Southern Caribbean.  The country’s close proximity to Venezuela, porous borders, and direct transportation routes to Europe, the United States, and Canada make it an ideal location for illicit drug transshipment.  While there is some local marijuana production, the majority of marijuana consumed domestically is imported from other islands in the Caribbean and South America.  Cocaine and other illicit drugs also transit the country or remain on the islands for domestic consumption.  The Trinidad and Tobago government continues to make incremental progress in its ability to investigate drug cases, but remains challenged by insufficient resources and capacity.  Law enforcement seized more marijuana and cocaine in 2018 compared to 2017.  The government remains committed to drug demand reduction, though treatment capacity is under-resourced and there is a lack of comprehensive data regarding domestic drug use.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1.  Institutional Development  Trinidad and Tobago demonstrates continued commitment to drug control through bilateral cooperation with the United States and other countries.  Trinidad and Tobago’s drug control institutions, however, remain challenged by deficiencies in staffing and funding.  There are ongoing efforts to break down existing silos within Trinidad and Tobago’s intelligence community, the military, law enforcement, and other agencies, though distrust continues to impede coordination.  In May, Trinidad and Tobago’s Parliament passed an Anti-Gang Act, now in effect, that criminalizes gang membership and otherwise aims to suppress criminal gang activity, which are viewed by the country’s authorities as among the primary drivers of drug trafficking and violent crime.  In August, the government named a new Minister of National Security, and appointed its first permanent Commissioner of Police since 2012.  Though the government’s draft 2019 budget proposes a slight decrease overall for national security matters, there are a number of initiatives to enhance police effectiveness, including a broad restructuring of the police service, which could improve drug control efforts.  Trinidad and Tobago, in collaboration with the Organization of American States’ Inter-American Drug Abuse Control Commission, also continues to expand a Regional Counterdrug Intelligence Training School to serve the English-speaking member states in the Caribbean.  Trinidad and Tobago has mutual legal assistance treaties with the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom.  The country is also party with the United States to a drug control and law enforcement letter of agreement; a maritime law enforcement agreement that enables the United States to patrol Trinidad and Tobago’s waters and detain vessels suspected of trafficking drugs; a shiprider agreement that allows U.S. Coast Guard law enforcement detachments aboard Trinidad \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 261  and Tobago Coast Guard vessels to board suspected ships in Trinidad and Tobago waters; and a customs mutual assistance agreement, which allows for the exchange of information to assist in the prevention and investigation of customs offenses.   The United States also maintains an extradition treaty with Trinidad and Tobago, and the Trinidad and Tobago government is largely cooperative with respect to extradition and mutual legal assistance matters.  2.  Supply Reduction  Marijuana is the only known locally produced illicit drug in Trinidad and Tobago. Production is concentrated in small farms in heavily forested, mountainous regions.  Traditionally, local producers compete with imports from St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Jamaica, and Guyana that are perceived to be of a higher quality.  Law enforcement information suggests that marijuana continues to enter the country via Venezuela, as part of a trend of increased trade of both licit and illicit goods between the two countries.   Other illicit drugs, primarily cocaine, are trafficked through the country by local and transnational organized crime groups, exploiting its close proximity to Venezuela, porous coastlines, and vulnerabilities at ports of entry.  The main destination for these drugs continues to be the European market, often via Africa, but some also reach the United States and Canada.  Criminal groups utilize commercial airlines, cargo ships, and small, privately owned boats and yachts to transport illicit drugs.  Anecdotal reports continue to suggest that small amounts of ketamine originating from Asia are also trafficked through the country.  Trinidad and Tobago law enforcement entities seized approximately 1.34 metric tons of marijuana and 325 kilograms (kg) of cocaine within the country during the first nine months of 2018, compared to seizures totaling approximately 956 kg and 47 kg, respectively, for the same period in 2017.  Robust crop, seedling, and cured plant eradications continued in 2018.  3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Information on drug-use trends in Trinidad and Tobago is largely anecdotal given the lack of comprehensive data.  The primary drug used is marijuana, followed by cocaine.  Drug treatment professionals assess that drug usage continues to increase among youth.  There are a number of drug treatment programs in Trinidad and Tobago supported by the government, non-governmental organizations, religious groups, and hospitals.   Trinidad and Tobago’s 2014 National Drug Policy and its companion Operational Plan for Drug Control in Trinidad and Tobago 2014-2018 aim to reduce both the supply of and demand for illegal drugs.  Drug prevention efforts include school-based education programs, training for educators, anti-drug media campaigns, and special outreach events.  The United States supported adolescent drug intervention training in 2018, including for police, prison, and probation officers.  The United States also supported a Juvenile Court Project, which established two children’s courts, promoted innovative youth peer resolution mechanisms, and introduced a restorative \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 262  justice approach to managing youth in conflict with the law, including with respect to drug matters.   4.  Corruption  The Government of Trinidad and Tobago neither directly encourages nor facilitates the illicit production or distribution of drugs nor the laundering of proceeds from the sale of illicit drugs.  No charges of drug-related corruption were filed against senior government officials in 2018.  Media and anecdotal reports of drug-related corruption in the ranks of the Police Service, Prison Service, Defense Force, Customs and Excise Division, and port employees are common.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  The United States supports a wide range of efforts designed to address crime and violence affecting citizens in Trinidad and Tobago, primarily through the Caribbean Basin Security Initiative (CBSI).  CBSI is a security partnership between the United States and Caribbean nations that seeks to substantially reduce illicit drug trafficking, advance public safety and citizen security, and promote justice.  The Trinidad and Tobago government is an active partner in CBSI programs.   Through CBSI, the United States continues to provide training and support to law enforcement and security agencies responsible for drug control, including the Police Service, Transnational Organized Crime Unit, Customs and Excise Division, Prison Service, and Coast Guard.  This support, together with joint law enforcement cooperation on drug trafficking investigations, resulted in a number of substantial drug seizures in 2018.  In May, for example, the Trinidad and Tobago Police Service’s Organized Crime and Intelligence Unit arrested and charged five airport personnel for attempting to smuggle 86.8 kg of cocaine – with an estimated street value of approximately $34 million – bound for New York from Trinidad’s Piarco International Airport.   The United States maintains a bilateral agreement with Trinidad and Tobago to suppress illicit traffic by sea and air.  This agreement includes provisions for ship boarding, shipriders, pursuit, entry to investigate, and over flight of territorial seas.  D.  Conclusion  The United States and Trinidad and Tobago enjoy a cooperative relationship against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime.  The individuals and units working to combat drug trafficking in Trinidad and Tobago, however, continue to face considerable institutional challenges.  The Trinidad and Tobago government should continue to implement reforms to improve the capacity of its law enforcement and criminal justice institutions to detect drug trafficking and effectively investigate, arrest, and prosecute suspected drug traffickers in a timely manner.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 263  Turkey  Turkey remains a transit country for illicit drug trafficking.  Heroin, opium, and cocaine are generally trafficked through Turkey to European markets, and amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) are trafficked to markets in the Middle East and Southeast Asia.  Turkish authorities continue to seize large amounts of opiates and hashish in Turkey.  Cooperation is inhibited by the Government of Turkey’s detention of a U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) local staff member for more than a year without charge.  The Turkish National Police Counter Narcotics Department is the country’s most proactive counterdrug force.  DEA works with the Counter Narcotics Department.  Components of the Ministry of Interior, also have some drug control responsibilities, and the Ministry of Health is responsible for regulating pharmaceutical products and the importation of chemicals for legitimate use.  The United States offers regional training opportunities to Turkish officials to provide additional skills to combat the illicit drug trade, although no Turkish official participated in trainings in 2018.    Most heroin trafficked via Turkey is destined for Western Europe.  Turkey is also a transit route for opiates smuggled from Afghanistan via Iran.  Turkish smugglers are frequently involved in both heroin sales and transport, as well as production and smuggling of synthetic drugs.  Transnational criminal networks reportedly have interests in heroin conversion laboratories operating in Iran near the Turkish border.  The government strictly controls licit opium poppy cultivation and pharmaceutical morphine production, with no apparent diversion into the illicit market.    Turkey is a transit route for methamphetamine smuggled from Iran and bound for Southeast Asia, as well as amphetamine-type stimulants from Eastern Europe destined for the Middle East.  Cocaine is trafficked from South America through Turkey to Europe.  Hashish is imported or grown domestically for local consumption.    According to Turkish authorities, during the first 10 months of 2018, Turkish authorities seized more than 71 metric tons (MT) of marijuana; nearly 15 MT of heroin; more than one MT of cocaine; nearly 300 kilograms (kg) of opium; nearly 400 kg of methamphetamine; seven million MDMA (ecstasy) tablets; and 16 million fenethylline tablets.    Illegal drug use in Turkey is relatively low, compared to other countries in the region, but there seems to be an increase in the number of people seeking treatment.  Turkey does not encourage or facilitate illicit production or distribution of narcotics or other controlled substances, or the laundering of proceeds from illegal drug transactions.  No senior-level government official is alleged to have participated in such activities in 2018.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 264  Ukraine  Although Ukraine is not a major drug source country, its location astride several important drug trafficking routes into Western Europe leaves it vulnerable as an important transit country.  Ukraine’s numerous ports on the Black and Azov seas, its extensive river routes, and its porous northern and eastern borders make Ukraine an attractive route for drug traffickers into the European Union’s (EU) illicit drug market.  Heroin from Afghanistan is trafficked through Russia, the Caucasus, and Turkey, before passing through Ukraine.  Latin American cocaine is moved through Ukrainian seaports and airports for both domestic use and further transit to EU countries.  Ukrainian law enforcement occasionally interdicts large shipments of drugs in commercial shipments transiting southern ports.  Usually, however, drugs are found in small quantities, ranging from several grams to several hundred grams.  Russian aggression in eastern Ukraine, including arming, training, and fighting alongside separatists, has created a new vulnerability for drug transit through the region.  The use of synthetic drugs and psychotropic substances, especially amphetamine-type stimulants, has been rapidly increasing in Ukraine over the past decade, following international trends.  Synthetic drugs are trafficked to Ukraine primarily from Poland, Lithuania, and the Netherlands, but they are also produced locally in small clandestine labs.  Most domestic drug abuse, however, continues to be focused on drugs made from illicit drug crops (cannabis and opium poppy) grown in the region.  These account for more than 90 percent of the total drug market in Ukraine.  In most instances, these drugs are either locally produced or supplied from Russia and Moldova.  During the first 10 months of 2018, Ukrainian law enforcement agencies (National Police of Ukraine, or NPU) reportedly detected and disrupted 37 international drug trafficking routes, dismantled 115 clandestine labs, and eliminated 63 organized criminal drug trafficking groups.  Approximately 3.89 metric tons of narcotics, psychotropic drugs, and other controlled substances were seized, including 38.9 kilograms (kg) of cocaine and 32 kg of psychotropic drugs.      The United States is providing assistance to help Ukraine bring its law enforcement institutions up to European standards, facilitating Ukraine’s integration into Euro-Atlantic institutions.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration has established good working relationships across the Ukrainian law enforcement sector, and ongoing training programs have deepened these relationships.  Through a variety of projects, the United States also assists the NPU in developing its capacities while simultaneously strengthening the Border Guards capability to control Ukraine’s 3,490 mile-long border.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 265  United Kingdom  Although the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland (UK) is not a source country for illicit drugs, it faces a serious domestic drug problem and is a major consumer and transshipment country.  Transnational criminal organizations continue to engage in drug trafficking within the UK, as well as additional criminal activity to include violent and financial crimes.  Demand in the UK for all common forms of illicit drugs is high.  The country’s consumption rates for cocaine and heroin are among the highest in Europe.  There are significant seizures of cannabis at UK borders, and UK authorities regularly disrupt domestic cannabis growth, varying from as few as 10 plants to warehouse quantities.  “Crack” cocaine use has increased, particularly in rural and coastal towns.  Crack cocaine has been linked to drug-trafficking networks active in England, Wales, and Scotland.    Fentanyl and fentanyl analogues are also present in the UK, though not on the scale seen in North America.  Although testing limitations prevent UK authorities from fully ascertaining the scale of the problem, 122 fentanyl-related deaths were recorded from between 2017 and March 2018.  Most fentanyl and fentanyl-related analogues available in the UK are manufactured in China and purchased on restricted internet sites, the so-called “Dark Web.”  In 2018, the National Crime Agency reported its first conviction for trafficking in fentanyl.  Unlike the United States, where historic widespread availability of prescription medicine was a driving force for opioid abuse and the use of fentanyl, there is far less prescription opioid abuse in the UK.  As the illicit online trade grows, the UK is among the largest global purchasers of drugs on the Dark Web, and a survey taken in 2018  showed that more than a quarter of British drug users bought substances on the Dark Web paying with cryptocurrency.    The United States and the United Kingdom enjoy an excellent bilateral relationship and cooperate closely on multilateral drug enforcement efforts.  U.S. authorities continue to conduct coordinated drug trafficking and money laundering investigations with the UK National Crime Agency and Metropolitan Police Service, as well as Police Scotland, the Police Services of Northern Ireland, and other UK law enforcement agencies.  U.S. authorities also regularly provide lead information on drug shipments bound for the UK, including couriers, parcels, and containerized cargo.   \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 266  Uzbekistan  A. Introduction  Sharing an 85-mile border with Afghanistan, Uzbekistan remains a significant transit country for Afghan opiates.  Traffickers exploit the country’s shared borders with Afghanistan and Tajikistan to smuggle illicit drugs through Uzbekistan primarily to Russia and Europe.  Criminals capitalize on Uzbekistan’s good infrastructure, corruption, and rugged border terrain to traffic drugs.  Uzbekistan’s long, poorly protected border with Tajikistan presents the country’s biggest challenge to interdicting illicit drugs.  Ten border crossing points along the Tajik-Uzbek border re-opened in 2018 after having been closed for more than a decade, increasing the risk of drug trafficking.    B. Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends   1. Institutional Development  Uzbekistan’s drug control strategy is detailed in the “Program of Complex Measures on Counteracting Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking for 2016-2020.”  The strategy outlines government agency responsibilities to restrict illicit drug trafficking, reduce demand, prevent abuse, improve enforcement-related legislation, and cooperate with international partners.  The Ministry of Interior, the State Security Service, the State Border Protection Committee, and the State Customs Committee are responsible for combatting narcotics trafficking, while the National Information and Analytical Center for Drug Control (NCDC) oversees policy coordination, data collection, and capacity development, but does not have an operational role.  An NCDC-led interagency working group is drafting a law to amend the Criminal Code and relevant regulations to include provisions for new psychoactive substances (NPS).     Uzbekistan shares drug enforcement information with its neighbors through the Central Asia Regional Information and Coordination Center (CARICC) and has two law enforcement professionals working on the CARICC staff in Almaty, Kazakhstan.  Uzbekistan also participates in several regional programs implemented by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), including the Container Control and Border Liaison Office programs, as well as the Central Asia and South Caucasus Mutual Legal Assistance Network.  Uzbekistan has signed cooperation agreements with other Central Asian countries, Russia, Latvia, the Czech Republic, Japan, and China.  Cooperation is generally focused on programs rather than operational activities.   Uzbekistan has neither an extradition treaty nor mutual legal assistance agreement with the United States.  The U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) has Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) in place for joint investigative activities and intelligence exchanges with the Ministry of Interior and the Office of the Prosecutor General’s Financial Intelligence Unit dedicated to money laundering investigations.  The DEA also has an MOU with the NCDC, facilitating information sharing and joint training.     2. Supply Reduction \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 267  Uzbekistan is not a significant source country of illicit drugs.  Although Uzbek officials identify the country’s poorly protected border with Tajikistan as the biggest challenge to interdicting smuggled drugs, it is likely that significant quantities also enter the country through official border crossing points, primarily from Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.  On an annual basis, Uzbekistan conducts a “Black Poppy” eradication campaign to destroy illicitly cultivated opium poppy and cannabis.  In 2017, the last year for which information is available, Uzbek authorities uncovered 895 cases of illegal drug cultivation – a 16 percent decrease from 2016 – and eradicated an aggregate cultivated area of 0.33 hectares.  During the first six months of 2018, Uzbek authorities registered 2,332 drug-related offenses – a 22 percent drop from the same period in 2017 – and detained 1,751 persons.  Also during the first six months of 2018, the government reported seizing 188.1 kilograms (kg) of marijuana; 179.1 kg of opium; 33 kg of hashish; and 14.9 kg of heroin.  Opium seizures have dropped considerably since 2016, declining 44.8 percent by volume in 2017 and again by 76.6 percent during the first six months of 2018 in comparison to the same period in 2017.  The NCDC attributes this decline to enhanced deterrence due to interdiction efforts at the country’s borders, as well as to changing patterns of drug trafficking from Afghanistan that might be reducing the flow of drugs through Uzbekistan.  The United States lacks sufficient information to verify these claims.  By volume, reported NPS seizures in 2017 fell to 361 grams from 579 grams in 2016.  However, the NCDC believes that drug use within Uzbekistan is shifting away from Afghan-sourced opioids to NPS and synthetic drugs, particularly Iranian-sourced methamphetamine and synthetic cannabinoids known locally as “spice” from China.  During the first six months of 2018, the authorities seized 247 NPS substances.     3. Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  Official data on domestic drug consumption is unreliable.  According to the latest available official statistics from 2017, the number of registered drug users declined by 23 percent from 2016 to 8,036.  Of this population, heroin users constituted 32.6 percent, and cannabis users 32.2 percent.  UNODC estimates that only 2.3 percent of drug users are female.  The last study of drug use prevalence in Uzbekistan was conducted in 2006 by UNODC.    Uzbekistan administers demand reduction and treatment programs.  The government regularly organizes outreach to school administrators on addiction prevention and support to persons with substance use disorders.  The EU is training local government representatives in prevention techniques.  With U.S. and UNODC support, Uzbekistan is implementing a long-term continuing education project to professionalize all substance use treatment staff in the country.  In 2018, UNODC conducted a series of trainings for 136 doctors on treatment and care for intravenous drug users.  In 2017, 2,202 patients – including 1,485 in-patients – received treatment.  Over 95 percent of such patients were male.  Drug treatment institutions also support phone “hotline” consultations, but these efforts likely reach only a small proportion of those suffering from substance use disorders.  Furthermore, as Uzbekistan prohibits opioid substitution therapy, treatment options are limited.   4. Corruption \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 268  Uzbekistan is implementing a National Anti-Corruption Action Plan and does not encourage or facilitate illegal activity associated with drug trafficking.  However, there is evidence of corruption at multiple levels of government, which confounds national drug control efforts.  Some government officials have reportedly been convicted on corruption charges.  Although most cases target low to mid-level officers, there are occasional high-profile cases, such as Uzbekistan’s former prosecutor general, who is under investigation for alleged extortion, bribery, and abuse of office.    C. National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  Uzbekistan’s drug control strategy seeks to increase the institutional capacity of the country’s law enforcement and criminal justice institutions through training.  In 2018, the U.S. government provided training and equipment to assist the Uzbek government to modernize its border crossing checkpoints, improve forensic capabilities, develop judicial capacity, and enhance the effectiveness of law enforcement agencies.  However, the agreements between the DEA and Uzbek agencies have not translated into significant operational cooperation.  Since closing its office in Uzbekistan in 2017, the DEA maintains liaison relationship from the regional DEA office in Almaty, Kazakhstan.   D. Conclusion  Drug control cooperation between the United States and Uzbekistan continued to grow slowly in 2018.  Uzbekistan made progress in regional cooperation and data sharing with CARICC members and the United States.  However, given the lack of independent data on drug use and trafficking within the country, it is difficult to estimate the true extent of the problem and whether Uzbekistan’s low seizure statistics accurately reflect law enforcement efficacy.  Sustainable anti-corruption practices, an independent drug use study, and increased exposure to international best practices could promote sustainable improvements in Uzbekistan’s ability to combat transnational drug trafficking.    \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 269  Venezuela  A.  Introduction  Venezuela continues to be a major drug-transit country and is one of the preferred trafficking routes in the Western Hemisphere for illegal drugs, predominately cocaine.  In 2018, Venezuela’s porous border with Colombia, weak judicial system, almost nonexistent international drug control cooperation, and permissive and corrupt environment provided ideal conditions for drug trafficking operations and associated violence.  There is insufficient data to determine current drug consumption trends in Venezuela.  The Venezuelan National Anti-Narcotics Office (ONA) has not published any statistics since 2015.  In 2018, under the government of former President Nicolás Maduro, the country’s porous borders offered a permissive environment to known terrorist groups involved in drug trafficking, including the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) and the National Liberation Army (ELN).  The Maduro government took no action against individuals and companies designated as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers by the U.S. Department of Treasury for playing a significant role in international drug trafficking.    B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends    1.  Institutional Development  In 2013, the Venezuelan National Anti-Narcotics Office (ONA) developed a National Anti-Drug Plan for 2015-2019 that sought to reduce drug consumption and increase prevention activities.  ONA reported working closely with civil society to provide anti-drug education training and athletic programming in different areas around the country to increase awareness and prevent consumption.  In May 2014, Venezuela signed an international agreement with Russia to cooperate in the fight against drugs.  Venezuela announced joint operations between the Russian Federal Drug Control Service and ONA.  The 2010 Organic Law on Drugs increased the penalties for drug trafficking and gave ONA the authority to seize the assets of individuals connected with drug trafficking.  Conflicting statistics make it difficult to assess 2018 seizures.  On February 4, ONA reported that since 2005 it had seized 658 metric tons (MT) of drugs, destroyed 284 laboratories, seized 37 planes, and closed 481 illegal landing strips.  Additionally, on September 28, ONA President Juan Grillo told the media that ONA had seized more than 22 MT of drugs in 2018, and added that the government seized 35 percent more marijuana compared to 2017.  However, during an October 25 press conference, OFAC-sanctioned Attorney General Tarek William Saab shared that since August 2017, the government had seized almost 20 MT of drugs (7.2 MT of cocaine, 12 MT of marijuana and other illicit substances).  Saab also claimed that Venezuela had seized 23 planes, closed 14 illegal landing strips, and arrested 49 people linked to drug trafficking.    2.  Supply Reduction  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 270  Venezuela remains a major transit country for cocaine shipments via aerial, terrestrial, and maritime routes.  Most flights suspected of trafficking drugs depart from Venezuelan states bordering Colombia, mainly from Zulia state. Trafficking by maritime conveyance includes the use of large cargo containers, fishing vessels, and “go-fast” boats.  The vast majority of illicit drugs that transited Venezuela in 2018 were destined for the Caribbean, Central America, the United States, West Africa, and Europe.  Colombian drug-trafficking organizations – including the FARC, ELN, and other criminal groups – facilitate the shipment of illicit drugs through Venezuela.   The Venezuelan government occasionally reports drug seizures, arrests, and destruction of drugs and airstrips to the public.  Venezuela is not a member of the Cooperative Situational Information Integration System through which countries predetermine information to share automatically with the United States.  Venezuelan authorities similarly do not share evidence about destruction of illicit drugs with U.S. officials.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment  The consumption of illicit drugs within Venezuela, especially cannabis and cocaine, remained a problem in 2018, but recent statistical data is unavailable.  ONA implemented a National Treatment System in 2013 as part of a nationwide program to treat substance use disorder.  The system uses professional care for detoxification and social reinsertion of those suffering from substance use disorders through a three-level program that includes the Center of Family Guidance, the Specialized Center for Prevention and Comprehensive Assistance, and the Socialist Therapeutic Community.     4.  Corruption  Although the Venezuelan government under former President Maduro did not officially encourage or facilitate illicit drug production or distribution as a matter of stated policy, public corruption was a major problem that made it easier for drug-trafficking organizations to move and smuggle illicit drugs.    Two nephews of former Venezuelan first lady Cilia Flores, Efrain Campo Flores and Francisco Flores de Freitas, were arrested in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, in November 2015 and expelled to the United States.  In December 2017, a U.S. federal court sentenced both nephews to 18 years in prison following their convictions on drug trafficking charges.  The Treasury Department has imposed sanctions on at least 22 individuals and 27 companies by designating them as Specially Designated Narcotics Traffickers pursuant to the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act.  These designations include current or former Venezuelan officials: in 2008, General Hugo Carvajal, General Henry Rangel Silva, and Ramón Rodríguez Chacín; in 2011, Freddy Bernal Rosales and Amilicar Jesús Figueroa, Major General Cliver Alcalá Cordones, and Ramón Isidro Madriz; in 2017, then Vice President Tareck El Aissami and front man Samarak López, and; in 2018, Pedro Luís Martín and two of his associates.  The Maduro government failed to take action against these or other government and military officials \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 271  with known links to the FARC or the Mexican cartels in 2018.  The government called the sanctions designation a “foreign plot to destabilize our government.”   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  Drug control cooperation between Venezuela and the United States has been limited and inconsistent since 2005, when Venezuela refused to sign a negotiated addendum to the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) to improve anti-drug cooperation.  The United States and Venezuela continue to exercise a 1991 maritime bilateral agreement allowing each country to board vessels of the opposite flag suspected of illicit drug trafficking in international waters.  D.  Conclusion  In 2018, the Venezuelan government failed to make demonstrable efforts to combat illegal drug activity and prosecute corrupt officials or suspected drug traffickers, including those sanctioned by the United States government.  The Maduro administration demonstrated a complete lack of will to make much-needed policy changes to enforce existing laws.  This created an extreme level of impunity exacerbated by lack of transparency and high levels of corruption.     \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 272  Vietnam  A.  Introduction  Vietnam is not a significant source or transit country for illegal drugs entering the United States, but remains a significant transshipment point for international criminal organizations that traffic heroin, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS), and cocaine to markets throughout East Asia and the Pacific.  Historically, the cultivation and production of illegal drugs within Vietnam has been uncommon, and the Vietnamese police did not conduct any investigations in 2018 targeting ATS production in the country.  The Government of Vietnam reports that approximately 90 percent of the illicit drugs seized in the country originate in Laos, Cambodia, Burma, Thailand, and China and are smuggled into the country via overland routes.  Lesser volumes of illegal drugs are smuggled through Vietnam via sea and air routes by use of human couriers, sea freight, and commercial cargo services.  Vietnam’s drug interdiction capacities are limited by poor equipment and training, as well as the rugged and remote terrain that defines much of the country’s borders.  Heroin remains the most commonly trafficked and abused illegal drug in the country, with persons addicted to heroin accounting for approximately 85 percent of the country’s registered users.  ATS is commonly available in both pill form and as crystal methamphetamine and is the second most commonly trafficked and used drug.  From 2017 to 2018, the cost of crystal methamphetamine in Vietnam continued to decline, signifying increasing availability.  Cocaine trafficking is also increasing in Vietnam, and 2018 saw the largest cocaine seizure on record in Vietnam.  B.  Drug Control Accomplishments, Policies, and Trends  1. Institutional Development    In 2017, Vietnam’s government allocated $95 million through 2020 to support drug control and drug prevention, and the country continued to implement its 2011 comprehensive anti-drug strategy.  Vietnam works with neighboring countries to carry out interdiction operations, with border liaison offices situated along the country’s borders with Laos and Cambodia.  The United States promotes counterdrug information sharing, coordination of operations, and capacity building with Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security.  Despite this, several factors still significantly inhibit Vietnam’s ability to investigate and prosecute drug trafficking organizations effectively.  Vietnam’s counterdrug police receive little to no formal training, and lack the resources necessary to conduct complex investigations.  Furthermore, Vietnam’s penal code lacks a conspiracy statute and prohibits the introduction of many types of evidence normally used to prosecute complex organized crime cases.  Vietnam does not have a mutual legal assistance or an extradition treaty with the United States.  The decision to engage bilaterally with the United States on international drug trafficking investigations is made on a case-by-case basis in accordance with a memorandum of \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 273  understanding between the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) and Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security.    2.  Supply Reduction    According to the Government of Vietnam, in 2017, Vietnamese police investigated approximately 22,346 drug related cases and arrested 34,494 people involved in drug related crimes.  According to official Government of Vietnam statistics, during the first six months of 2018, Vietnamese police investigated approximately 12,863 drug related cases and arrested 18,472 people involved in drug related crimes, representing an approximate 9 percent increase in investigations and a 5 percent increase in arrests over the same period in 2017.  During this same six-month period, Vietnamese police seized 880 kilograms (kg) of heroin, twice the amount of heroin seized during 2017; 81 kg of opium; 1,090 kg of cannabis; 414 kg of ATS and other synthetic drugs; 485,000 ATS tablets; 100 kg of cocaine; and 2.5 metric tons of khat.  Synthetic drug production is rare in Vietnam, as there is a ready supply of synthetic drugs entering Vietnam from neighboring countries.  In April 2017, the Vietnamese police dismantled a nation-wide drug trafficking organization that operated 13 clandestine ATS laboratories throughout southern Vietnam, but they did not identify any other clandestine ATS laboratories for the remainder of 2017 or the first half of 2018.   3.  Public Information, Prevention, and Treatment    The Government of Vietnam promotes and funds drug abuse and awareness programs as part of its comprehensive anti-drug strategy.  However, the willingness of Vietnamese citizens to seek drug abuse treatment is limited by the fear of involuntary incarceration in “drug rehabilitation centers,” which, in reality, are no different from prisons and provide minimal actual treatment for addiction.  In 2017, the United States budgeted $1.4 million to provide technical support for medication assisted therapy and other programming to address the substance abuse issues that drive HIV transmission, including intravenous drug abuse. The Government of Vietnam reports that the total number of registered heroin and ATS users is 224,690 people, which represents a less than one percent increase from the previous year.  The Government of Vietnam also estimates that approximately 25 percent of new HIV infections in 2017 resulted from intravenous drug abuse.   4.  Corruption   Corruption is endemic in Vietnam and plagues almost every sector of the government.  However, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security and other agencies involved in drug control operations continue to pursue an aggressive drug control agenda, as is evidenced by the year-to-year increases in drug-related investigations, arrests, and seizures.   C.  National Goals, Bilateral Cooperation, and U.S. Policy Initiatives  \fINCSR 2019 Volume 1      Country Reports 274  Vietnamese police continued to expand their cooperation with foreign governments in 2018 to combat regional drug trafficking, particularly with China, Laos, and Cambodia.  The Vietnamese police also collaborate closely with Australian and U.S. law enforcement authorities to target international drug trafficking organizations.  In 2016, Vietnam’s Ministry of Public Security renewed its memorandum of understanding with DEA.  As a result, in 2017 and 2018, information-sharing expanded dramatically between DEA and Vietnam’s law enforcement authorities, and the number of joint U.S.-Vietnamese investigations increased significantly.  In 2017, the United States began a comprehensive, four-year assistance program intended to strengthen the capacity of Vietnam’s counternarcotics police.  The program is designed to create a cadre of 100 subject matter experts on drug trafficking investigations within the Vietnamese police force.  This program continued through 2018, and remains on track for completion in 2020.  D.  Conclusion  Vietnam continues to struggle with controlling drug trafficking and abuse, but maintains an aggressive posture against drug trafficking organizations.  Senior law enforcement officers continue to maintain support for increased engagement with the United States on both investigations and capacity building.  Barring any significant policy shifts, Vietnam’s law enforcement capacity is poised to continue to grow and professionalize with international support.  The United States encourages the Government of Vietnam to consider taking additional steps to modernize and expand its capacity to provide treatment and rehabilitation programs for those suffering from substance use disorders.

The Constitution of the Islamic Republic recognizes Islam, Judaism, and Christianity, as well as Zoroastrianism, and encourages participation of their members in politics and society to the extent that this participation is not considered threatening to the Islamic Republic. The constitution and major laws emphasize the dominance of Islam and Muslims in all spheres of public life. Under Iranian law, converting from Islam is considered apostasy and can result in severe punishments, including the death penalty. Religious minorities possess certain codified rights, but the legislators have prohibited non-Muslims from being guardians of Muslim children, non-Muslim men from marrying Muslim women, and non-Muslims from inheriting from Muslims. Non-Muslims also do not receive the same forms of redress for certain harms as Muslims receive. Members of religious minorities cannot receive equal retribution for some crimes or take senior governmental, military, or high public managerial positions. Established rights of constitutionally recognized religious minorities are reserved and protected to a significantly higher degree than those of members of unrecognized minorities, which include those who convert from Islam or speak against the Islamic Republic’s interpretations of Islam.   I.  Religious Minorities under Iranian Law  According to the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran, “color, race, language, and the like” must not bestow any privilege.1 The provision does not specify religion as one of the prohibited bases for discrimination, and the phrase “and the like” has not been interpreted by Iranian jurists to include religion. While Iranian law regards constitutionally recognized non-Muslims as persons who are protected under international treaties that Iran has signed and ratified, and under other domestic laws2—mainly article 13 of the constitution—Islamic jurisprudence as interpreted by Iranian Islamic jurists considers non-Muslims, including constitutionally recognized non-Muslims, as unbelievers in Islam (kafir). Therefore, Iranian law, in numerous places, has considered what it has vaguely presumed as “superiority” in religious faith as a ground for validating important civil rights—for example, testimony3—and it has clearly and openly discriminated on the basis of religion in such matters as inheritance, financial retribution, and blood money (diya).4 Generally, when the law is silent or vague, there is room for judges and  1 Const. of Iran, as amended 1989, art. 19, Constitute Project, https://perma.cc/KY5A-GYCQ (unofficial English translation). 2 Civil Code of Iran art. 9, WIPO, https://perma.cc/N4JU-JKKC (unofficial English translation); Const. arts. 4, 13, 14. 3 Id. art. 1313. 4 Id. art. 881 bis. \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 2 jurists to make determinations according to their understanding of the law and Islamic criteria.5 Article 20 of the constitution guarantees equality before the law, but qualifies that this equality is subject to “conformity with Islamic criteria,” which has led to discrimination against certain groups in the application of the law.  Laws such as article 1313 of the Civil Code of Iran, which infers “superiority” in religious faith for the purposes of acceptance and validity of testimony, or article 4 of the constitution, which emphasizes the importance of the dominance of Islam and Muslims in all spheres of public life, can lead to indirect discrimination without mentioning non-Muslims. For instance, the constitution defines a judge or justice as a wise person who rules according to the Qur’an and Islamic jurisprudence.6 When applied, this provision would indirectly eliminate non-Muslims from becoming judges. Similarly, article 73 of the constitution states that judges must use Islamic interpretations to decipher laws when necessary.7  II.  Individual Legal Provisions concerning Religious Minorities  Iranian law sometimes juxtaposes provisions that grant rights to religious minorities and provisions that discriminate against them; both types of provisions may appear in the same article or in consecutive articles. Such discriminatory sections or criteria undermine the egalitarian language in the law and the delivery of basic human rights. Thus, constitutional provisions with language favoring religious minorities are often not fully realized, leading to unequal treatment and a lack of opportunities for religious minorities in the country,8 which affects all non-Muslims but mostly non-Muslims from faiths that are not recognized by the constitution, or those who convert from Islam or speak against the Islamic Republic’s interpretations of Islam.  A.   Constitutional Provisions  The Constitution of Iran obligates the government to eliminate unjust discrimination, create equal opportunities for all citizens, and ensure universal rights for all women and men, establishing equality for all people before the law.9 However, this provision is immediately followed by an article that establishes Islamic criteria as the principal for civil, penal, financial, economic, administrative, cultural, military, political, and all other provisions of the constitution, as well as all other laws and regulations, and declares that Islamic jurists of the Constitutional Council are the judges in this matter.10 It further provides that all Muslims form a single nation and the government has the duty of formulating its general policies with the aim of bringing about the political, economic, and cultural unity of the Islamic world.11   5 Const. art. 167. 6 Id. art. 167. 7 Id. art. 73. 8 Maryam Dehkordi, Blood Money, Inheritance and Property: Religious Discrimination in Iranian Law, Iran Wire (July 12, 2021), https://perma.cc/B2N6-67GK. 9 Const. art. 3. 10 Id. art. 4. 11 Id. art. 11. \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 3 1.  Official Religion  According to the constitution, the official religion of Iran is Islam and the Twelver Ja’fari school of Shi’a Islamic jurisprudence. Other Islamic schools, including the Hanafi, Shafi’i, Maliki, Hanbali, and Zaydi, are to be accorded full respect, and their followers are free to act in accordance with their own jurisprudence in performing their religious rites. These schools enjoy official status in matters pertaining to religious education, affairs of personal status (marriage, divorce, inheritance, and wills), and related litigation in courts of law. In regions of the country where Muslims following any one of these schools constitute the majority, local regulations, within the bounds of the jurisdiction of local councils, are to be in accordance with the respective school, without infringing upon the rights of the followers of other schools.12  2.  Recognized Religions  Zoroastrian, Jewish, and Christian Iranians are the only recognized religious minorities, and are free within the limits of the law to perform their religious rites and ceremonies and act according to their own canon in matters of personal affairs and religious education.13  3.  Treatment of Non-Muslim Citizens  Article 14 of the constitution states that “[t]he government of the Islamic Republic of Iran and all Muslims are duty-bound to treat non-Muslims in conformity with ethical norms and the principles of Islamic justice and equity, and to respect their human rights. This principle applies to all who refrain from engaging in conspiracy or activity against Islam and the Islamic Republic of Iran.”14  4.  Application of Political and Cultural Rights to Members of Religious Minorities  The official language and script of Iran is Persian, or Farsi. Official documents, correspondence, and texts, as well as textbooks, must be in this language and script. However, the use of regional and tribal languages in the press and mass media, and in the teaching of literature in schools, is allowed in addition to Persian.15  The formation of parties, societies, political or professional associations, and religious societies, whether pertaining to Islam or to one of the recognized religious minorities, is permitted if they do not violate the principles of independence, freedom, national unity, the criteria of Islam, or the basis of the Islamic Republic. No one may be prevented from participating in the such groups or compelled to participate in them.16   12 Id. art. 12. 13 Id. art. 13. 14 Id. art. 14. 15 Id. art. 15. 16 Id. art. 26. \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 4 Recognized religious minorities have the right to be represented in the Islamic Consultative Assembly (Majles), Iran’s parliament. The constitution established the Majles with 270 members and provided that this number could not increase by more than 20 members every 10 years, considering demographic, political, geographic, and other similar factors. The Zoroastrian and Jewish communities are allowed to elect one representative each, while Assyrian and Chaldean Christians jointly elect one representative, and Armenian Christians in the north and in the south of the country each elect one representative.17 The five representatives from religious minorities can take the oath of office on their respective holy books.18  The Muslim faith is required for being a member of the Guardian Council, an institution established to examine the compatibility of legislation passed by the Majles with Islam. The Guardian Council consists of six Muslim men selected by the supreme leader who are experts in Islamic jurisprudence (fuqaha’) and “conscious of the present needs and the issues of the day,” and six jurists specializing in different areas of law who are elected by the Majles from among the Muslim jurists nominated by the Head of the Judicial Power.19  The president of Iran must also be a Muslim. The constitution states that the president is elected from among religious and political personalities possessing the following qualifications: Iranian origin, Iranian nationality, administrative capacity and resourcefulness, a good past record, trustworthiness and piety, and convinced belief in the fundamental principles of the Islamic Republic of Iran and the official madhhab (school of Islamic jurisprudence) of the country (the Twelver Ja‘fari school).20  B.   Civil Code Provisions  1.  Inheritance for Non-Muslims  According to article 881 bis of the civil code, an unbeliever in Islam (kafir) may not  inherit from a Muslim, and if there is even one Muslim among the heirs of a deceased unbeliever, the unbelieving heirs cannot inherit even if their class and degree of succession give them priority over the Muslim heir.21 On December 3, 2022, Directive No. 9000/23767/1000 of the Office of the First Deputy of the Judiciary Branch interpreted this provision to allow the exclusion of constitutionally recognized religious minorities from the meaning of the term kafir.22 Before this  17 Id. art. 64. 18 Id. art. 67. 19 Id. art. 91. 20 Id. art. 115. 21 Civil Code art. 881 bis. 22 Office of the First Deputy of the Judiciary Branch, Judiciary Branch Directive No. 9000/23767/1000 regarding the Single Article of the Law on Allowing Observance of the Personal Status Principles of Non-Shia Iranians in Courts, Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dec. 10, 2022, No. 1616, https://perma.cc/VP75-A5BZ (in Farsi); Office of the First Deputy of the Judiciary Branch, Amendment to Judiciary Branch Directive No. 9000/23767/1000 regarding the Single Article of the Law on Allowing Observance of the Personal Status Principles of Non-Shia Iranians in Courts, Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dec. 18, 2022, No. 1618, https://perma.cc/37CP-7KYZ (in Farsi). \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 5 directive was issued, the discriminatory provisions of article 881 bis of the civil code (as last amended in 1991) had long been applied to all non-Muslims.  2.  Value of Testimony Given by a Non-Muslim  According to the civil code, a witness must possess maturity, sanity, justice, faith, and legitimate descent,23 which Iranian Muslim jurists interpret as meaning being of the Muslim faith. In practice this interpretation has prevented non-Muslims from testifying in most cases.  C.  Islamic Penal Code Provisions  1.  National Security Offenses  The Islamic Penal Code of Iran uses broad and vaguely worded national security laws to criminalize the exercise of fundamental rights and retain punishments that amount to torture or cruel and degrading treatment, such as stoning, flogging, and amputation. The code also contains discriminatory provisions against religious minorities related to the implementation of punishments, retribution, and compensation, as well as the use of evidence in court.24  2.  Punishments in the Iranian Penal Code  Punishments provided in the Iranian Penal Code are divided into four categories: Hadd, Qisas, Diya, and Ta’zir. Hadd is a punishment whose grounds, type, amount, and conditions of execution are specified in Shari’a.25 Qisas is the main punishment for intentional bodily crimes against life, limbs, and abilities, and which is applied in accordance with Book One of the penal code. Diya may be a fixed or unfixed monetary amount under Shari’a that is determined by law and imposed for unintentional bodily crimes against life, limbs, and abilities, or for intentional crimes to which qisas is not applicable. Ta’zir is a punishment that does not fall under the categories of hadd, qisas, or diya and is determined by law for the commission of acts prohibited under Shari’a or for violation of state rules. The type, amount, and conditions of execution, as well as mitigation, suspension, cancellation, and other relevant rules of ta’zir crimes, are determined by law.26  3.  Blood Money (Diya)  Historically, Iranian law, influenced by interpretations from Islamic jurists, has exhibited significant religious and gender-based discrimination, including in the context of blood money (diya), where the law established clear and implied distinctions among Muslims; constitutionally recognized non-Muslims; unrecognized non-Muslims; and men, women, and transgender  23 Id. art. 1313. 24 Faraz Sanei, Codifying Repression: An Assessment of Iran’s New Penal Code, Human Rights Watch (HRW) (Aug. 28, 2012), https://perma.cc/QW4T-9V2F. 25 Abdullahi Ahmed An-Nai’m & Tynan Power, Sharia Law, Muslims for Progressive Values, https://perma.cc/M3H7-6Z4M. 26 Islamic Penal Code of Iran, Books I–II, 1392 [2013], arts. 14–18, https://perma.cc/K58F-9KSY. \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 6 individuals. Before 2003, constitutionally recognized non-Muslims were openly awarded lower diya amounts than Muslims in accordance with the implied language of the law and Islamic interpretations of it, though the exact fraction of this difference varied due to diverse interpretations of Islamic jurisprudence. In 2003, an amendment was introduced to the then-existing article 297 of the penal code, explicitly providing for equality between constitutionally recognized non-Muslims and Muslims with regard to diya.27 In 2013, a revised version of the penal code (currently in force), added a separate new article 554, replacing the 2003 amendment and unequivocally mandating equal diya amounts for both Muslims and constitutionally recognized non-Muslims.28  Despite these changes, deeply rooted discrimination on the basis of religion and gender remains in Iranian law. As an example, article 550 of the current (2013) code (reflecting article 300 of the previous code) and article 551 of the current code (relating to transgender individuals) set the diya amount for both women and transgender individuals at half of that for men. Notably, the article 551 provision on transgender individuals was added in 2013 to the revised code; previously, only women and men were mentioned. This discriminatory difference in diya amounts in turn affects provisions in article 382 of the 2013 code regarding diya in homicide cases:  • Article 382 and Muslim perpetrators: Article 382 of the 2013 penal code specifies that if a Muslim man murders a Muslim woman, he faces the death penalty. However, the difference between the diya for a Muslim man and a Muslim woman must be paid to the next of kin of the Muslim male perpetrator before the execution of the death sentence.  • Article 382 and non-Muslim perpetrators: Article 382 exempts the payment of the diya difference to the next of kin of the non-Muslim male perpetrator when he is responsible for the murder of a Muslim woman, essentially stating that no additional compensation is required in such cases.29  In 2014, a consultancy opinion of the Central Legal Consultancy Office of the Judiciary Branch clarified that regardless of whether the male perpetrator of the murder of a Muslim woman is a Muslim or a constitutionally recognized non-Muslim, half of the male diya (for the difference between the women’s and men’s diya under the law) must be paid to the next of kin of the male perpetrator before the execution of the death sentence. The opinion indicated that the rationale was based on article 554 of the new (2013) penal code, which equalized the diya for Muslims and constitutionally recognized non-Muslims. Despite this interpretation, the discriminatory language of article 382 against non-Muslims remains unaltered in today’s penal code, accompanied by an annotation reflecting the consultative opinion.30    27 Penal Code, Book III, 1370 [1991], as amended 1382 [2003], art. 297, https://perma.cc/B6W8-YHPZ (in Farsi). 28 Penal Code, Book IV, 1392 [2013], art. 554, https://perma.cc/GMH7-9ZKW (in Farsi). 29 Penal Code, Book III, 1392 [2013], art. 382, https://perma.cc/Z369-M8YZ (in Farsi). 30 Central Legal Consultancy Office, Judiciary Branch, Apr. 15, 2014, Reference No. 83/93/7, Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Sept. 10, 2014, No. 20248, https://perma.cc/K9LC-YXFY (in Farsi). \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 7 4.  Same-Sex Relationships  Articles 234–236 of the penal code codify and criminalize same-sex relationships. In the case of gay intercourse, the penalty is a death sentence for both parties if the insertive party has engaged in intercourse by using force or coercion, or if he is married and could have a sexual relationship with his wife; otherwise, he is to be sentenced to 100 lashes. The punishment for the receptive party is the death penalty, unless he engaged in the act due to force or coercion by the insertive party. If the insertive party is a non-Muslim and the receptive party is a Muslim, the punishment for the insertive party is the death penalty, regardless of any of the conditions stated above. Article 240 of the penal code sets the maximum penalty for lesbian relations at 100 lashes for both parties regardless of any conditions—whether the parties are Muslims or non-Muslims, or whether there has been coercion or force.  5.  Adultery  According to articles 250–251 of the penal code, the hadd punishment for untruthfully accusing someone of a same-sex relationship (sexual acts) or adultery is 80 lashes. The defamatory act results in the hadd punishment for the offender when the person who is the subject of the defamation is specified, pubescent, sane, and Muslim, and it is not evident whether they engaged in a same-sex relationship or adultery. If the person who is the subject of the defamation is unspecified, nonpubescent, insane, or non-Muslim, the offender would be sentenced to 31 to 74 lashes of ta’zir flogging of the sixth grade.  6.  Zina Punishment  According to article 224 of the penal code, the crime of zina, which is unauthorized premarital sex, is punished by the death penalty if committed between blood relatives who are prohibited from marrying, with a stepmother, by a non-Muslim man with a Muslim woman, or by coercion or with application of force.  7.  Alcohol Consumption  According to articles 265–266 of the penal code, the punishment for consumption of intoxicants is 80 lashes. A non-Muslim is to be sentenced to this punishment only if they publicly consumed the intoxicants. If a drunk non-Muslim person appears in a public place, even if alcohol was not consumed in public, the offender is to be sentenced to the punishment prescribed for committing a sinful act openly, which is imprisonment for a period of 10 days to two months or up to 74 lashes.31   31 Penal Code, Book V, 1392 [2013], art. 638 (864), https://perma.cc/K286-PNTF (in Farsi). The Iranian Penal Code comprises five books, each covering different kinds of crimes and punishments. In the 2013 version of the code, Books I–IV underwent revisions with changed article numbers. In contrast, Book V remained largely unaltered, retaining its original articles and numbering. This has resulted in varying practices in publishing the code, with some versions using Book V’s original article numbers and others continuing the sequence from the current Book IV. In some cases, both numbers are presented, with the old number followed by the new number in parentheses. Consequently, Book V spans articles numbered 498 (729) to 785 (1008). For example, article 638 (864) in Book V bears both its original number 638 and the new number 864, following the sequence from the current Book IV in the 2013 code. These discrepancies in numbering practices can lead to errors, as identical \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 8 8.  Penalties for Homicide  If a non-Muslim, regardless of their religion, intentionally kills a Muslim, a member of a constitutionally recognized religious minority, or a non-Muslim otherwise protected within the borders of Iran, this person is to be sentenced to death.32 If a Muslim, a member of a recognized religious minority, or a person protected within the borders of Iran commits a crime against a non-Muslim who is not one of these specified groups, this crime would be reclassified under Book V of the penal code, and the perpetrator would be subject to a lighter punishment.  9.  Usurious Transactions  Usury is forbidden in Islam.33 The penal code provides for discriminatory behavior against non-Muslims in a provision that exempts Muslims from certain penalties when they are involved in usurious transactions with non-Muslims but does not offer a reciprocal exemption for non-Muslims receiving usury from Muslims.34 Additionally, the code fails to safeguard the property rights of non-Muslims in cases where the owner is unknown, leading to the transfer of the non-Muslim’s property to the supreme leader without considering the owner’s religion.35  III.  Personal Status and Relations Regulations  According to article 13 of the constitution, the personal relations and status of constitutionally recognized religious minorities in Iran must be governed according to the accepted and common principles of their respective religions. This includes various family matters, including child adoption. The application of rules accepted by religious minorities is allowed in legal proceedings and daily practices as long as a specific case does not cause “public disorder.” This principle is further developed by articles 6 and 7 of the civil code, which provide for regulating the personal relations and status of foreign nationals residing in Iran under laws of their country of origin to the extent that is provided by bilateral treaties, international conventions, and rules of reciprocity.36  Article 13 of the constitution is supported by statutory and regulatory acts addressing the personal relations and status of individuals of each of the constitutionally recognized minority religions and various recognized minority sects. For instance, detailed legislation for the personal relations of Zoroastrians includes the full right of Zoroastrians to adoption and to the Zoroastrian tradition of “bridging” to pass their inheritance to an adopted or to a bridged Zoroastrian child,  article numbers may appear for different articles, one in Book III or IV and another in Book V, addressing distinct subjects. 32 Penal Code, Book III, 1392 [2013], art. 310, https://perma.cc/Z369-M8YZ (in Farsi). 33 Usury (Ribaa), New Muslim Guide, https://perma.cc/RDT8-MY3B. 34 Penal Code, Book V, art. 595 (826), https://perma.cc/K286-PNTF. The article number, 595 (826), in Book V of the Penal Code provides both the older, pre-2013 article number and the new number enclosed in parentheses, aligning with the 2013 code’s sequence (e.g., Book IV ends at article 728, and Book V starts at 498 (729)). 35 Id. 36  Civil Code arts. 6, 7. \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 9 with the difference that an adopted Zoroastrian child can inherit from both biological and adoptive parents.37 Zoroastrians without biological children can declare their wish in their last will and testament to use bridging to enable  the bridged person to inherit from them as their own child. Otherwise, according to Iranian law, a Zoroastrian person’s property would pass to their next of kin in order of availability, or would be passed to their choice of charity, or to the local Zoroastrian organization at the place of their residence or, if such an organization is unavailable locally, to the Zoroastrian organization of Tehran. A separate law for non-Shi’a persons grants authority to the Iranian courts to base the adoption-related proceedings of non-Shi’a persons on the relevant provisions of the respective adoptive mother’s or adoptive father’s religion and the accepted practices of their religion.38  Additionally, an article regarding requirements for fostering a child who is poorly supervised, neglected, or orphaned eliminates non-Muslims from constitutionally unrecognized religious minorities from fostering or adopting children, and indicates a need for religious compatibility between the fostering parents and the child, except if the qualified court decides that it would be in the best interest of a non-Muslim child to place them with Muslim foster parents.39 The legislator specified that guardians cannot choose or appoint non-Muslim guardians for Muslim children.40  IV. Legal Status of Unrecognized Religious Minorities and Members of Other Minority Communities  Article 23 of the constitution contains provisions to protect freedom of thought, religion, and belief, stating that “no one may be molested or taken to task simply for holding a certain belief.” However, international human rights organizations report that the Iranian regime’s discriminatory treatment of unrecognized religious minorities, its stance on apostasy, and the government’s misuse of legislation to suppress dissent clearly violate human rights.41  37 The practice of bridging stemmed from the belief in ancient Zoroastrianism that those without biological children would be unable to attain immortality. Consequently, adoption by individuals lacking biological offspring played a pivotal role in this belief by bridging the gap to the afterlife, guaranteeing the perpetuation of family lines and religious customs. 38 Law of July 22, 1933 on Allowing Observance of the Personal Status Principles of Non-Shi’a Iranians in Courts, single art.), https://perma.cc/F2MU-AGDS (in Farsi); Law of June 24, 1993 on Proceedings related to the Personal Status and Religious Teachings of Zoroastrian, Christian, and Jewish Iranians, single art., https://perma.cc/35L5-XLJA (in Farsi); Executive Regulations of the Personal Status Laws of Zoroastrians of Iran, May 17, 2007, arts. 44, 56, Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Dec. 6, 2007, No. 18285, https://perma.cc/F7BB-JWFV. 39 Law of September 22, 2013 on the Protection of Poorly Supervised, Neglected or Orphaned Children and Teenagers, art. 6, https://perma.cc/6JX9-6ULC (in Farsi). Further analysis of the intentions of the legislator regarding religious compatibility reveals that the same rule applies to the guardianship of Muslim children, stating that a sarparast (guardian) of a Muslim child cannot designate a non-Muslim guardian or transfer guardianship to a non-Muslim.

Discrimination against Unrecognized Religious Minorities  Examples of the Iranian government’s discriminatory practices against unrecognized religious minorities extend to the arrest and prosecution of Baha’is on vague national security charges and, subsequently, their imprisonment and the closure of their businesses. Reportedly, they are systematically denied registration at public universities because of their faith. Similarly, Christian converts from Islam face charges of propaganda against the state for practicing their faith and engaging with missionaries. Sunni Muslims and ethnic minorities, such as Azeris, Kurds, Arabs, and Baluchs, also experience restrictions on their cultural and political activities, with minority activists facing arbitrary arrests and unfair trials.42  B.   Criminalization of Dissent and Apostasy  Apostasy, the act of converting from Islam to another faith, carries severe consequences in Iran. Article 167 of the constitution and article 220 of the penal code address punishments, which are not explicitly codified but may carry the death penalty on the basis of Islamic jurisprudence. An example is the case of Yousef Nadarkhani, a pastor who faced the death penalty for converting from Islam to Christianity and for charges of evangelization. His sentence was later overturned. Expressing dissent against the Iranian regime’s interpretation of Islam or opposing certain laws is an offense against Islam and the Islamic Republic. Dissenters are often charged with committing crimes against national security, insulting the supreme leader, and “waging war against God” (mohaarebeh). The regime exploits overly broad articles of the penal code, including those related to propaganda against the state and establishment of or membership in “disruptive groups,” to prosecute human rights and religious minority activists.43  C.  Blasphemy Laws and Freedom of Speech  As previously mentioned, Iran’s constitution contains provisions to protect freedom of thought, religion, and belief, but it also qualifies that this freedom must conform to Islamic criteria. Blasphemy laws in Iran, particularly articles 262 and 513 of the penal code, are used to punish those who insult sacred religious values or Prophet Muhammad, with potential sentences ranging from imprisonment to the death penalty.

Chapter II of Book V of the penal code, particularly articles 262, 513, and 514, address crimes of “insulting sacred religious values” and “criminal attempt on national authorities.” These articles set the punishments for insulting the sacred values of Islam, the prophets, the twelve Shi’a imams, and the supreme leader, which can range from six months’ to two years’ imprisonment or one year to five years’ imprisonment, depending on the case. “Speaking disparagingly of Prophet Muhammad” is punishable by the death penalty. \fIran: Legal Status of Religious Minorities The Law Library of Congress 11 religious values can be categorized as insulting Islam or promoting atheism, leading to severe consequences, including the death penalty.44  D.  International Obligations  Iran’s actions concerning freedom of thought, conscience, and religion, as well as the right to life, stand in violation of international obligations under the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR). Iran has ratified both the UDHR and the ICCPR, making its actions in these areas subject to international scrutiny.45  44 Elwely Elwelly, Iran Hangs Two Men for Blasphemy, Reuters (May 8, 2023), https://perma.cc/CA6X-XDHC. 45 World Report 2022: Iran – Events of 2021, supra note 41; World Report 2021: Iran – Events of 2020, supra note 41; OHCHR, supra note 41; Iran Human Rights Documentation Center, supra note 41; Sanei, supra note 24; Dehkordi, supra note 8.

It has not been updated.\fThe Law Library of Congress 1 United States: Legalization and Regulation of Drugs Jason S. Zarin Legal Reference Librarian This report describes legislation concerning the legalization or regulation of drugs in the United States introduced in the US Congress during the last ten years.1 Under current federal law, the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)2 regulates drugs deemed to pose a risk of abuse and dependence. The CSA applies whether the drugs are medical or recreational, or legally or illegally distributed. Under the CSA, drugs that fall within the purview of the act are classified within five categories of controlled substances (schedules I through V). The schedule on which a controlled substance is placed determines the level of restriction imposed on its production, distribution, and possession, as well as the penalties applicable to any improper handling of the substance.3 Accordingly, any legislation that would legalize or decriminalize a particular controlled substance as a matter of federal law would require changing the substance’s classification under a CSA schedule or removing it from the purview of the CSA entirely. The following is a list of proposed legislation regarding legalization or regulation of drugs that would be considered controlled substances under the CSA introduced in the 112th through the 117th Congresses (2011-2021), which we identified on the official website for U.S. federal legislative information, Congress.gov. Only one bill (H.R. 3884, the MORE Act of 2020) proceeded to a vote. The MORE Act of 2020 passed the House of Representatives by a vote of 228 to 164 and was sent to the Senate, but the Senate did not vote on the bill. No legislation at the federal level has been passed by both houses of Congress and enacted into law.

savings. We arehonored by your trust.Our position carries with it the responsibility to report to you what we would like to know if we were theabsentee owner and you were the manager. We enjoy communicating directly with you through this annual letter, andthrough the annual meeting as well.Our policy is to treat all shareholders equally. Therefore, we do not hold discussions with analysts nor largeinstitutions. Whenever possible, also, we release important communications on Saturday mornings in order tomaximize the time for shareholders and the media to absorb the news before markets open on Monday.A wealth of Berkshire facts and figures are set forth in the annual 10-K that the company regularly files withthe S.E.C. and that we reproduce on pages K-1 – K-119. Some shareholders will find this detail engrossing; otherswill simply prefer to learn what Charlie and I believe is new or interesting at Berkshire.Alas, there was little action of that sort in 2021. We did, though, make reasonable progress in increasing theintrinsic value of your shares. That task has been my primary duty for 57 years. And it will continue to be.What You OwnBerkshire owns a wide variety of businesses, some in their entirety, some only in part. The second grouplargely consists of marketable common stocks of major American companies. Additionally, we own a few non-U.S.equities and participate in several joint ventures or other collaborative activities.Whatever our form of ownership, our goal is to have meaningful investments in businesses with both durableeconomic advantages and a first-class CEO. Please note particularly that we own stocks based upon our expectationsabout their long-term business performance and not because we view them as vehicles for timely market moves. Thatpoint is crucial: Charlie and I are not stock-pickers; we are business-pickers.I make many mistakes. Consequently, our extensive collection of businesses includes some enterprises thathave truly extraordinary economics, many others that enjoy good economic characteristics, and a few that aremarginal. One advantage of our common-stock segment is that – on occasion – it becomes easy to buy pieces ofwonderful businesses at wonderful prices. That shooting-fish-in-a-barrel experience is very rare in negotiatedtransactions and never occurs en masse. It is also far easier to exit from a mistake when it has been made in themarketable arena.3\fSurprise, SurpriseHere are a few items about your company that often surprise even seasoned investors:•Many people perceive Berkshire as a large and somewhat strange collection of financial assets. In truth,Berkshire owns and operates more U.S.-based “infrastructure” assets – classified on our balance sheet asproperty, plant and equipment – than are owned and operated by any other American corporation. Thatsupremacy has never been our goal. It has, however, become a fact.At yearend, those domestic infrastructure assets were carried on Berkshire’s balance sheet at $158 billion.That number increased last year and will continue to increase. Berkshire always will be building.•Every year, your company makes substantial federal income tax payments. In 2021, for example, we paid$3.3 billion while the U.S. Treasury reported total corporate income-tax receipts of $402 billion.Additionally, Berkshire pays substantial state and foreign taxes. “I gave at the office” is an unassailableassertion when made by Berkshire shareholders.Berkshire’s history vividly illustrates the invisible and often unrecognized financial partnership betweengovernment and American businesses. Our tale begins early in 1955, when Berkshire Fine Spinning andHathaway Manufacturing agreed to merge their businesses. In their requests for shareholder approval, thesevenerable New England textile companies expressed high hopes for the combination.The Hathaway solicitation, for example, assured its shareholders that “The combination of the resources andmanagements will result in one of the strongest and most efficient organizations in the textile industry.” Thatupbeat view was endorsed by the company’s advisor, Lehman Brothers (yes, that Lehman Brothers).I’m sure it was a joyous day in both Fall River (Berkshire) and New Bedford (Hathaway) when the unionwas consummated. After the bands stopped playing and the bankers went home, however, the shareholdersreaped a disaster.In the nine years following the merger, Berkshire’s owners watched the company’s net worth crater from$51.4 million to $22.1 million. In part, this decline was caused by stock repurchases, ill-advised dividendsand plant shutdowns. But nine years of effort by many thousands of employees delivered an operating lossas well. Berkshire’s struggles were not unusual: The New England textile industry had silently entered anextended and non-reversible death march.During the nine post-merger years, the U.S. Treasury suffered as well from Berkshire’s troubles. All told, thecompany paid the government only $337,359 in income tax during that period – a pathetic $100 per day.Early in 1965, things changed. Berkshire installed new management that redeployed available cash andsteered essentially all earnings into a variety of good businesses, most of which remained good through theyears. Coupling reinvestment of earnings with the power of compounding worked its magic, and shareholdersprospered.Berkshire’s owners, it should be noted, were not the only beneficiary of that course correction. Their “silentpartner,” the U.S. Treasury, proceeded to collect many tens of billions of dollars from the company in incometax payments. Remember the $100 daily? Now, Berkshire pays roughly $9 million daily to the Treasury.4\fIn fairness to our governmental partner, our shareholders should acknowledge – indeed trumpet – the factthat Berkshire’s prosperity has been fostered mightily because the company has operated in America. Ourcountry would have done splendidly in the years since 1965 without Berkshire. Absent our American home,however, Berkshire would never have come close to becoming what it is today. When you see the flag, saythanks.•From an $8.6 million purchase of National Indemnity in 1967, Berkshire has become the world leader ininsurance “float” – money we hold and can invest but that does not belong to us. Including a relatively smallsum derived from life insurance, Berkshire’s total float has grown from $19 million when we entered theinsurance business to $147 billion.So far, this float has cost us less than nothing. Though we have experienced a number of years when insurancelosses combined with operating expenses exceeded premiums, overall we have earned a modest 55-yearprofit from the underwriting activities that generated our float.Of equal importance, float is very sticky. Funds attributable to our insurance operations come and go daily,but their aggregate total is immune from precipitous decline. When it comes to investing float, we cantherefore think long-term.If you are not already familiar with the concept of float, I refer you to a long explanation on page A-5. Tomy surprise, our float increased $9 billion last year, a buildup of value that is important to Berkshire ownersthough is not reflected in our GAAP (“generally-accepted accounting principles”) presentation of earningsand net worth.Much of our huge value creation in insurance is attributable to Berkshire’s good luck in my 1986 hiring ofAjit Jain. We first met on a Saturday morning, and I quickly asked Ajit what his insurance experience hadbeen. He replied, “None.”I said, “Nobody’s perfect,” and hired him. That was my lucky day: Ajit actually was as perfect a choice ascould have been made. Better yet, he continues to be – 35 years later.One final thought about insurance: I believe that it is likely – but far from assured – that Berkshire’s floatcan be maintained without our incurring a long-term underwriting loss. I am certain, however, that there willbe some years when we experience such losses, perhaps involving very large sums.Berkshire is constructed to handle catastrophic events as no other insurer – and that priority will remain longafter Charlie and I are gone.Our Four GiantsThrough Berkshire, our shareholders own many dozens of businesses. Some of these, in turn, have acollection of subsidiaries of their own. For example, Marmon has more than 100 individual business operations,ranging from the leasing of railroad cars to the manufacture of medical devices.•Nevertheless, operations of our “Big Four” companies account for a very large chunk of Berkshire’s value.Leading this list is our cluster of insurers. Berkshire effectively owns 100% of this group, whose massivefloat value we earlier described. The invested assets of these insurers are further enlarged by the extraordinaryamount of capital we invest to back up their promises.5\fThe insurance business is made to order for Berkshire. The product will never be obsolete, and sales volumewill generally increase along with both economic growth and inflation. Also, integrity and capital will foreverbe important. Our company can and will behave well.There are, of course, other insurers with excellent business models and prospects. Replication of Berkshire’soperation, however, would be almost impossible.•Apple – our runner-up Giant as measured by its yearend market value – is a different sort of holding. Here,our ownership is a mere 5.55%, up from 5.39% a year earlier. That increase sounds like small potatoes. Butconsider that each 0.1% of Apple’s 2021 earnings amounted to $100 million. We spent no Berkshire fundsto gain our accretion. Apple’s repurchases did the job.It’s important to understand that only dividends from Apple are counted in the GAAP earnings Berkshirereports – and last year, Apple paid us $785 million of those. Yet our “share” of Apple’s earnings amountedto a staggering $5.6 billion. Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an actwe applaud. Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his firstlove, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.•BNSF, our third Giant, continues to be the number one artery of American commerce, which makes it anindispensable asset for America as well as for Berkshire. If the many essential products BNSF carries wereinstead hauled by truck, America’s carbon emissions would soar.Your railroad had record earnings of $6 billion in 2021. Here, it should be noted, we are talking about theold-fashioned sort of earnings that we favor: a figure calculated after interest, taxes, depreciation,amortization and all forms of compensation. (Our definition suggests a warning: Deceptive “adjustments” toearnings – to use a polite description – have become both more frequent and more fanciful as stocks haverisen. Speaking less politely, I would say that bull markets breed bloviated bull . . ..)BNSF trains traveled 143 million miles last year and carried 535 million tons of cargo. Both accomplishmentsfar exceed those of any other American carrier. You can be proud of your railroad.•BHE, our final Giant, earned a record $4 billion in 2021. That’s up more than 30-fold from the $122 millionearned in 2000, the year that Berkshire first purchased a BHE stake. Now, Berkshire owns 91.1% of thecompany.BHE’s record of societal accomplishment is as remarkable as its financial performance. The company hadno wind or solar generation in 2000. It was then regarded simply as a relatively new and minor participant inthe huge electric utility industry. Subsequently, under David Sokol’s and Greg Abel’s leadership, BHE hasbecome a utility powerhouse (no groaning, please) and a leading force in wind, solar and transmissionthroughout much of the United States.Greg’s report on these accomplishments appears on pages A-3 and A-4. The profile you will find there is notin any way one of those currently-fashionable “green-washing” stories. BHE has been faithfully detailing itsplans and performance in renewables and transmissions every year since 2007.To further review this information, visit BHE’s website at brkenergy.com. There, you will see that thecompany has long been making climate-conscious moves that soak up all of its earnings. More opportunitieslie ahead. BHE has the management, the experience, the capital and the appetite for the huge power projectsthat our country needs.6\fInvestmentsNow let’s talk about companies we don’t control, a list that again references Apple. Below we list our fifteenlargest equity holdings, several of which are selections of Berkshire’s two long-time investment managers, ToddCombs and Ted Weschler. At yearend, this valued pair had total authority in respect to $34 billion of investments,many of which do not meet the threshold value we use in the table. Also, a significant portion of the dollars that Toddand Ted manage are lodged in various pension plans of Berkshire-owned businesses, with the assets of these plans notincluded in this table.12/31/21SharesCompanyPercentage ofCompanyOwnedCost*Market(in millions)151,610,700American Express Company . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .19.91,28724,804907,559,761Apple Inc. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .5.631,089161,1551,032,852,006Bank of America Corp. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .12.814,63145,95266,835,615The Bank of New York Mellon Corp. . . . . . . . . . . . .8.32,9183,882225,000,000BYD Co.

Earlyin 2023, Berkshire will purchase an additional interest in Pilot that will raise our ownership to 80% and lead to ourfully consolidating Pilot’s earnings, assets and liabilities in our financial statements.7\fU.S. Treasury BillsBerkshire’s balance sheet includes $144 billion of cash and cash equivalents (excluding the holdings ofBNSF and BHE). Of this sum, $120 billion is held in U.S. Treasury bills, all maturing in less than a year. That stakeleaves Berkshire financing about 1⁄2 of 1% of the publicly-held national debt.Charlie and I have pledged that Berkshire (along with our subsidiaries other than BNSF and BHE) will alwayshold more than $30 billion of cash and equivalents. We want your company to be financially impregnable and neverdependent on the kindness of strangers (or even that of friends). Both of us like to sleep soundly, and we want ourcreditors, insurance claimants and you to do so as well.But $144 billion?That imposing sum, I assure you, is not some deranged expression of patriotism. Nor have Charlie and I lostour overwhelming preference for business ownership. Indeed, I first manifested my enthusiasm for that 80 years ago,on March 11, 1942, when I purchased three shares of Cities Services preferred stock. Their cost was $114.75 andrequired all of my savings. (The Dow Jones Industrial Average that day closed at 99, a fact that should scream to you:Never bet against America.)After my initial plunge, I always kept at least 80% of my net worth in equities. My favored status throughoutthat period was 100% – and still is. Berkshire’s current 80%-or-so position in businesses is a consequence of myfailure to find entire companies or small portions thereof (that is, marketable stocks) which meet our criteria for long-term holding.Charlie and I have endured similar cash-heavy positions from time to time in the past. These periods arenever pleasant; they are also never permanent. And, fortunately, we have had a mildly attractive alternative during2020 and 2021 for deploying capital. Read on.Share RepurchasesThere are three ways that we can increase the value of your investment. The first is always front and centerin our minds: Increase the long-term earning power of Berkshire’s controlled businesses through internal growth orby making acquisitions. Today, internal opportunities deliver far better returns than acquisitions. The size of thoseopportunities, however, is small compared to Berkshire’s resources.Our second choice is to buy non-controlling part-interests in the many good or great businesses that arepublicly traded. From time to time, such possibilities are both numerous and blatantly attractive. Today, though, wefind little that excites us.That’s largely because of a truism: Long-term interest rates that are low push the prices of all productiveinvestments upward, whether these are stocks, apartments, farms, oil wells, whatever. Other factors influencevaluations as well, but interest rates will always be important.Our final path to value creation is to repurchase Berkshire shares. Through that simple act, we increase yourshare of the many controlled and non-controlled businesses Berkshire owns. When the price/value equation is right,this path is the easiest and most certain way for us to increase your wealth. (Alongside the accretion of value tocontinuing shareholders, a couple of other parties gain: Repurchases are modestly beneficial to the seller of therepurchased shares and to society as well.)8\fPeriodically, as alternative paths become unattractive, repurchases make good sense for Berkshire’s owners.During the past two years, we therefore repurchased 9% of the shares that were outstanding at yearend 2019 for a totalcost of $51.7 billion. That expenditure left our continuing shareholders owning about 10% more of all Berkshirebusinesses, whether these are wholly-owned (such as BNSF and GEICO) or partly-owned (such as Coca-Cola andMoody’s).I want to underscore that for Berkshire repurchases to make sense, our shares must offer appropriate value.We don’t want to overpay for the shares of other companies, and it would be value-destroying if we were to overpaywhen we are buying Berkshire. As of February 23, 2022, since yearend we repurchased additional shares at a cost of$1.2 billion. Our appetite remains large but will always remain price-dependent.It should be noted that Berkshire’s buyback opportunities are limited because of its high-class investor base.If our shares were heavily held by short-term speculators, both price volatility and transaction volumes wouldmaterially increase. That kind of reshaping would offer us far greater opportunities for creating value by makingrepurchases. Nevertheless, Charlie and I far prefer the owners we have, even though their admirable buy-and-keepattitudes limit the extent to which long-term shareholders can profit from opportunistic repurchases.Finally, one easily-overlooked value calculation specific to Berkshire: As we’ve discussed, insurance “float”of the right sort is of great value to us. As it happens, repurchases automatically increase the amount of “float” pershare. That figure has increased during the past two years by 25% – going from $79,387 per “A” share to $99,497, ameaningful gain that, as noted, owes some thanks to repurchases.A Wonderful Man and a Wonderful BusinessLast year, Paul Andrews died. Paul was the founder and CEO of TTI, a Fort Worth-based subsidiary ofBerkshire. Throughout his life – in both his business and his personal pursuits – Paul quietly displayed all the qualitiesthat Charlie and I admire. His story should be told.In 1971, Paul was working as a purchasing agent for General Dynamics when the roof fell in. After losing ahuge defense contract, the company fired thousands of employees, including Paul.With his first child due soon, Paul decided to bet on himself, using $500 of his savings to found Tex-Tronics(later renamed TTI). The company set itself up to distribute small electronic components, and first-year sales totaled$112,000. Today, TTI markets more than one million different items with annual volume of $7.7 billion.But back to 2006: Paul, at 63, then found himself happy with his family, his job, and his associates. But hehad one nagging worry, heightened because he had recently witnessed a friend’s early death and the disastrous resultsthat followed for that man’s family and business. What, Paul asked himself in 2006, would happen to the many peopledepending on him if he should unexpectedly die?For a year, Paul wrestled with his options. Sell to a competitor? From a strictly economic viewpoint, thatcourse made the most sense. After all, competitors could envision lucrative “synergies” – savings that would beachieved as the acquiror slashed duplicated functions at TTI.But . . . Such a purchaser would most certainly also retain its CFO, its legal counsel, its HR unit. Their TTIcounterparts would therefore be sent packing. And ugh! If a new distribution center were to be needed, the acquirer’shome city would certainly be favored over Fort Worth.9\fWhatever the financial benefits, Paul quickly concluded that selling to a competitor was not for him. He nextconsidered seeking a financial buyer, a species once labeled – aptly so – a leveraged buyout firm. Paul knew, however,that such a purchaser would be focused on an “exit strategy.” And who could know what that would be? Broodingover it all, Paul found himself having no interest in handing his 35-year-old creation over to a reseller.When Paul met me, he explained why he had eliminated these two alternatives as buyers. He then summedup his dilemma by saying – in far more tactful phrasing than this – “After a year of pondering the alternatives, I wantto sell to Berkshire because you are the only guy left.” So, I made an offer and Paul said “Yes.” One meeting; onelunch; one deal.To say we both lived happily ever after is an understatement. When Berkshire purchased TTI, the companyemployed 2,387. Now the number is 8,043. A large percentage of that growth took place in Fort Worth and environs.Earnings have increased 673%.Annually, I would call Paul and tell him his salary should be substantially increased. Annually, he would tellme, “We can talk about that next year, Warren; I’m too busy now.”When Greg Abel and I attended Paul’s memorial service, we met children, grandchildren, long-timeassociates (including TTI’s first employee) and John Roach, the former CEO of a Fort Worth company Berkshire hadpurchased in 2000. John had steered his friend Paul to Omaha, instinctively knowing we would be a match.At the service, Greg and I heard about the multitudes of people and organizations that Paul had silentlysupported. The breadth of his generosity was extraordinary – geared always to improving the lives of others,particularly those in Fort Worth.In all ways, Paul was a class act.* * * * * * * * * * * *Good luck – occasionally extraordinary luck – has played its part at Berkshire. If Paul and I had not enjoyeda mutual friend – John Roach – TTI would not have found its home with us. But that ample serving of luck was onlythe beginning. TTI was soon to lead Berkshire to its most important acquisition.Every fall, Berkshire directors gather for a presentation by a few of our executives. We sometimes choosethe site based upon the location of a recent acquisition, by that means allowing directors to meet the new subsidiary’sCEO and learn more about the acquiree’s activities.In the fall of 2009, we consequently selected Fort Worth so that we could visit TTI. At that time, BNSF,which also had Fort Worth as its hometown, was the third-largest holding among our marketable equities. Despite thatlarge stake, I had never visited the railroad’s headquarters.Deb Bosanek, my assistant, scheduled our board’s opening dinner for October 22. Meanwhile, I arranged toarrive earlier that day to meet with Matt Rose, CEO of BNSF, whose accomplishments I had long admired. When Imade the date, I had no idea that our get-together would coincide with BNSF’s third-quarter earnings report, whichwas released late on the 22nd.The market reacted badly to the railroad’s results. The Great Recession was in full force in the third quarter,and BNSF’s earnings reflected that slump. The economic outlook was also bleak, and Wall Street wasn’t feelingfriendly to railroads – or much else.10\fOn the following day, I again got together with Matt and suggested that Berkshire would offer the railroad abetter long-term home than it could expect as a public company. I also told him the maximum price that Berkshirewould pay.Matt relayed the offer to his directors and advisors. Eleven busy days later, Berkshire and BNSF announceda firm deal. And here I’ll venture a rare prediction: BNSF will be a key asset for Berkshire and our country a centuryfrom now.The BNSF acquisition would never have happened if Paul Andrews hadn’t sized up Berkshire as the righthome for TTI.ThanksI taught my first investing class 70 years ago. Since then, I have enjoyed working almost every year withstudents of all ages, finally “retiring” from that pursuit in 2018.Along the way, my toughest audience was my grandson’s fifth-grade class. The 11-year-olds were squirmingin their seats and giving me blank stares until I mentioned Coca-Cola and its famous secret formula. Instantly, everyhand went up, and I learned that “secrets” are catnip to kids.Teaching, like writing, has helped me develop and clarify my own thoughts. Charlie calls this phenomenonthe orangutan effect: If you sit down with an orangutan and carefully explain to it one of your cherished ideas, youmay leave behind a puzzled primate, but will yourself exit thinking more clearly.Talking to university students is far superior. I have urged that they seek employment in (1) the field and (2)with the kind of people they would select, if they had no need for money. Economic realities, I acknowledge, mayinterfere with that kind of search. Even so, I urge the students never to give up the quest, for when they find that sortof job, they will no longer be “working.”Charlie and I, ourselves, followed that liberating course after a few early stumbles. We both started as part-timers at my grandfather’s grocery store, Charlie in 1940 and I in 1942. We were each assigned boring tasks and paidlittle, definitely not what we had in mind. Charlie later took up law, and I tried selling securities. Job satisfactioncontinued to elude us.Finally, at Berkshire, we found what we love to do. With very few exceptions, we have now “worked” formany decades with people whom we like and trust. It’s a joy in life to join with managers such as Paul Andrews orthe Berkshire families I told you about last year. In our home office, we employ decent and talented people – no jerks.Turnover averages, perhaps, one person per year.I would like, however, to emphasize a further item that turns our jobs into fun and satisfaction - - - - workingfor you. There is nothing more rewarding to Charlie and me than enjoying the trust of individual long-termshareholders who, for many decades, have joined us with the expectation that we would be a reliable custodian of theirfunds.Obviously, we can’t select our owners, as we could do if our form of operation were a partnership. Anyonecan buy shares of Berkshire today with the intention of soon reselling them. For sure, we get a few of that type ofshareholder, just as we get index funds that own huge amounts of Berkshire simply because they are required to doso.11\fTo a truly unusual degree, however, Berkshire has as owners a very large corps of individuals and familiesthat have elected to join us with an intent approaching “til death do us part.” Often, they have trusted us with a large– some might say excessive – portion of their savings.Berkshire, these shareholders would sometimes acknowledge, might be far from the best selection they couldhave made. But they would add that Berkshire would rank high among those with which they would be mostcomfortable. And people who are comfortable with their investments will, on average, achieve better results than thosewho are motivated by ever-changing headlines, chatter and promises.Long-term individual owners are both the “partners” Charlie and I have always sought and the ones weconstantly have in mind as we make decisions at Berkshire. To them we say, “It feels good to ‘work’ for you, and youhave our thanks for your trust.”The Annual MeetingClear your calendar! Berkshire will have its annual gathering of capitalists in Omaha on Friday, April 29ththrough Sunday, May 1st. The details regarding the weekend are laid out on pages A-1 and A-2. Omaha eagerly awaitsyou, as do I.I will end this letter with a sales pitch. “Cousin” Jimmy Buffett has designed a pontoon “party” boat that isnow being manufactured by Forest River, a Berkshire subsidiary. The boat will be introduced on April 29 at ourBerkshire Bazaar of Bargains. And, for two days only, shareholders will be able to purchase Jimmy’s masterpiece ata 10% discount.

Business DescriptionBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (“Berkshire,” “Company” or “Registrant”) is a holding company owning subsidiariesengaged in numerous diverse business activities. The most important of these are insurance businesses conducted on both aprimary basis and a reinsurance basis, a freight rail transportation business and a group of utility and energy generation anddistribution businesses. Berkshire also owns and operates numerous other businesses engaged in a variety of manufacturing,services, retailing and other activities. Berkshire is domiciled in the state of Delaware, and its corporate headquarters is inOmaha, Nebraska.Berkshire’s operating businesses are managed on an unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized orintegrated business functions. Berkshire’s corporate senior management team participates in and is ultimately responsible forsignificant capital allocation decisions, investment activities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of theoperating businesses.Berkshire’s senior management is also responsible for establishing and monitoring Berkshire’s corporate governancepractices, including monitoring governance efforts, including those at the operating businesses, and participating in theresolution of governance-related issues as needed. Berkshire’s Board of Directors is responsible for assuring an appropriatesuccessor to the Chief Executive Officer. The Berkshire Code of Business Conduct and Ethics emphasizes, among otherthings, the commitment to ethics and compliance with the law and provides basic standards for ethical and legal behavior ofits employees.Human capital and resources are an integral and essential component of Berkshire’s businesses. Berkshire and itsconsolidated subsidiaries employed approximately 372,000 people worldwide at the end of 2021, of which approximately77% were in the United States and 21% were represented by unions. Employees engage in a wide variety of occupations.Consistent with Berkshire’s decentralized management philosophy, Berkshire’s operating businesses individually establishspecific policies and practices concerning the attraction and retention of personnel within the organizations. Given the widevariations in the nature and size of business activities, policies and practices often vary widely among Berkshire’s operatingsubsidiaries. Policies and practices commonly address, among other things: maintaining a safe work environment andminimizing or eliminating workplace injuries; offering competitive compensation to employees, which includes varioushealth insurance and retirement benefits, as well as other benefits such as incentives to recognize and reward performance;wellness programs; training, learning and career advancement opportunities; and hiring practices intended to identifyqualified candidates and promote diversity and inclusion in the workforce.Insurance and Reinsurance BusinessesBerkshire’s insurance and reinsurance business activities are conducted through numerous domestic and foreign-basedinsurance subsidiaries. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries provide insurance and reinsurance of property and casualty risksand reinsurance of life and health risks worldwide. Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries employed approximately 50,500 peopleat the end of 2021. For purposes of this discussion, entities that provide insurance or reinsurance are referred to as insurers.In direct or primary insurance activities, the insurer assumes the risk of loss from persons or organizations that aredirectly subject to the risks. Such risks may relate to property, casualty (or liability), life, accident, health, financial or otherperils that may arise from an insurable event. In reinsurance activities, the insurer assumes defined portions of risks that otherdirect insurers or reinsurers assumed in their own insuring activities.Reinsurance contracts are normally classified as treaty or facultative contracts. Treaty reinsurance refers to reinsurancecoverage for all or a portion of a specified group or class of risks ceded by a direct insurer or reinsurer, while facultativereinsurance involves coverage of specific individual underlying risks. Reinsurance contracts are further classified as quota-share or excess. Under quota-share (proportional or pro-rata) reinsurance, the reinsurer shares proportionally in the originalpremiums and losses of the direct insurer or reinsurer. Excess (or non-proportional) reinsurance provides for theindemnification of the direct insurer or reinsurer for all or a portion of the loss in excess of an agreed upon amount or“retention.” Both quota-share and excess reinsurance contracts may provide for aggregate limits of indemnification.Insurance and reinsurance are generally subject to regulatory oversight throughout the world. Except for regulatoryconsiderations, there are virtually no barriers to entry into the insurance and reinsurance industry. Competitors may bedomestic or foreign, as well as licensed or unlicensed. The number of competitors within the industry is not known. Insurerscompete on the basis of reliability, financial strength and stability, financial ratings, underwriting consistency, service,business ethics, price, performance, capacity, policy terms and coverage conditions.\fK-2Insurers based in the United States (“U.S.”) are subject to regulation by their states of domicile and by those states inwhich they are licensed to write policies on an admitted basis. The primary focus of regulation is to assure that insurers arefinancially solvent and that policyholder interests are otherwise protected. States establish minimum capital levels forinsurance companies and establish guidelines for permissible business and investment activities. States have the authority tosuspend or revoke a company’s authority to do business as conditions warrant. States regulate the payment of dividends byinsurance companies to their shareholders and other transactions with affiliates. Dividends, capital distributions and othertransactions of extraordinary amounts are subject to prior regulatory approval.Insurers may market, sell and service insurance policies in the states where they are licensed. These insurers arereferred to as admitted insurers. Admitted insurers are generally required to obtain regulatory approval of their policy formsand premium rates. Non-admitted insurance markets have developed to provide insurance that is otherwise unavailablethrough admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance, often referred to as “excess and surplus” lines, is procured by either state-licensed surplus lines brokers who place risks with insurers not licensed in that state or by the insured party’s directprocurement from non-admitted insurers. Non-admitted insurance is subject to considerably less regulation with respect topolicy rates and forms. Reinsurers are normally not required to obtain regulatory approval of premium rates or reinsurancecontracts.The insurance regulators of every state participate in the National Association of Insurance Commissioners (“NAIC”).The NAIC adopts forms, instructions and accounting procedures for use by U.S. insurers in preparing and filing annualstatutory financial statements. However, an insurer’s state of domicile has ultimate authority over these matters. In addition toits activities relating to the annual statement, the NAIC develops or adopts statutory accounting principles, model laws,regulations and programs for use by its members. Such matters deal with regulatory oversight of solvency, risk management,compliance with financial regulation standards and risk-based capital reporting requirements.U.S. states, through the NAIC, and international insurance regulators through the International Association ofInsurance Supervisors (“IAIS”) have been developing standards and best practices focused on establishing a common set ofprinciples (“Insurance Core Principles”) and framework (“ComFrame”) for the regulation of large multi-national insurancegroups. The IAIS is developing capital standards for internationally active insurance groups (the “Insurance CapitalStandard”) based on a consolidated group approach and is also evaluating a potentially comparable group capital standardbased on the aggregation of regulated entities and their underlying local capital requirements (the “Aggregation Method”).The IAIS standards address a variety of topics regarding supervision, coordination of regulators, insurance capital standards,risk management and governance. While the IAIS standards do not have legal effect, the states and the NAIC areimplementing various group supervision regulatory tools and mandates that are responsive to certain IAIS standards. U.S.state regulators have formed supervisory colleges intended to promote communication and cooperation amongst the variousdomestic and international insurance regulators. The Nebraska Department of Insurance acts as the lead supervisor for ourgroup of insurance companies and chairs the Berkshire supervisory college. U.S. state regulators now require insurancegroups to file an annual report, the Own Risk Solvency Assessment or ORSA, with the group’s lead supervisor. The NAICrecently adopted a group capital calculation based on methodology similar to the Aggregation Method, which leverages theNAIC’s existing Risk Based Capital standards. The NAIC’s group capital calculation is a tool designed to help the leadsupervisor understand the capital adequacy across an insurance group. The NAIC is also developing further tools, includingvarious liquidity assessments, that will likely be imposed on insurance groups in the near future.Berkshire’s insurance companies maintain capital strength at exceptionally high levels, which differentiates them fromtheir competitors. Collectively, the combined statutory surplus of Berkshire’s U.S.-based insurers was approximately $301billion at December 31, 2021. Berkshire’s major insurance subsidiaries are rated AA+ by Standard & Poor’s and A++(superior) by A.M. Best with respect to their financial condition and claims paying ability.The Terrorism Risk Insurance Act of 2002 established within the Department of the Treasury a Terrorism InsuranceProgram (“Program”) for commercial property and casualty insurers by providing federal reinsurance of insured terrorismlosses. The Program currently extends to December 31, 2027 through other Acts, most recently the Terrorism Risk InsuranceProgram Reauthorization Act of 2019. Hereinafter these Acts are collectively referred to as TRIA. Under TRIA, theDepartment of the Treasury is charged with certifying “acts of terrorism.” Coverage under TRIA occurs if the industryinsured loss for certified events occurring during the calendar year exceeds $200 million in any calendar year.To be eligible for federal reinsurance, insurers must make available insurance coverage for acts of terrorism, byproviding policyholders with clear and conspicuous notice of the amount of premium that will be charged for this coverageand of the federal share of any insured losses resulting from any act of terrorism. Assumed reinsurance is specificallyexcluded from TRIA participation. TRIA currently also excludes certain forms of direct insurance (such as personal andcommercial auto, burglary, theft, surety and certain professional liability lines). Reinsurers are not required to offer terrorismcoverage and are not eligible for federal reinsurance of terrorism losses.\fK-3In the event of a certified act of terrorism, the federal government will reimburse insurers (conditioned on theirsatisfaction of policyholder notification requirements) for 80% of their insured losses in excess of an insurance group’sdeductible. Under the Program, the deductible is 20% of the aggregate direct subject earned premium for relevant commerciallines of business in the immediately preceding calendar year. The aggregate deductible in 2022 for Berkshire’s insurancegroup is expected to approximate $1.6 billion. There is also an aggregate program limit of $100 billion on the amount of thefederal government coverage for each TRIA year.The extent of insurance regulation varies significantly among the countries in which our non-U.S. operations conductbusiness. While each country imposes licensing, solvency, auditing and financial reporting requirements, the type and extentof the requirements differ substantially. For example:•in some countries, insurers are required to prepare and file monthly and/or quarterly financial reports, andin others, only annual reports;•some regulators require intermediaries to be involved in the sale of insurance products, whereas otherregulators permit direct sales contact between the insurer and the customer;•the extent of restrictions imposed upon an insurer’s use of local and offshore reinsurance vary;•policy form filing and rate regulation vary by country;•the frequency of contact and periodic on-site examinations by insurance authorities differ by country;•the scope and prescriptive requirements of an insurer’s risk management and governance framework varysignificantly by country; and•regulatory requirements relating to insurer dividend policies vary by country.Significant variations can also be found in the size, structure and resources of the local regulatory departments that overseeinsurance activities. Certain regulators prefer close relationships with all subject insurers and others operate a risk-basedapproach.Berkshire’s insurance group operates in some countries through subsidiaries and in some countries through branches ofsubsidiaries. Berkshire insurance subsidiaries are located in several countries, including Germany, the United Kingdom(“U.K.”), Ireland, Australia and South Africa, and also maintain branches in several other countries. Most of these foreignjurisdictions impose local capital requirements. Other legal requirements include discretionary licensing procedures, localretention of funds and records, and data privacy and protection program requirements. Berkshire’s international insurancecompanies are also subject to multinational application of certain U.S. laws.There are various regulatory bodies and initiatives that impact Berkshire in multiple international jurisdictions and thepotential for significant effect on the Berkshire insurance group could be heightened as a result of recent industry andeconomic developments.In 2016, the U.K. voted in a national referendum to withdraw from the European Union (“EU”) (“Brexit”), whichresulted in the U.K.’s withdrawal from the EU on January 31, 2020. In anticipation of the U.K. leaving the EU, BerkshireHathaway European Insurance DAC in Ireland was established to permit property and casualty insurance and reinsurancebusinesses to continue to operate in the EU, and Berkshire continues to maintain a substantial presence in London followingBrexit.Berkshire’s insurance underwriting operations include the following groups: (1) GEICO, (2) Berkshire HathawayPrimary Group and (3) Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group. Except for retroactive reinsurance and periodic paymentannuity products that generate significant amounts of up-front premiums along with estimated claims expected to be paidover long time periods (creating “float,” see Investments section), Berkshire expects to achieve an underwriting profit overtime and to reject inadequately priced risks. Underwriting profit is defined as earned premiums less associated incurredlosses, loss adjustment expenses and underwriting and policy acquisition expenses. Underwriting profit does not includeincome earned from investments. Additional information related to each of Berkshire’s underwriting groups follows.GEICO—GEICO is headquartered in Chevy Chase, Maryland. GEICO’s insurance subsidiaries consist of GovernmentEmployees Insurance Company, GEICO General Insurance Company, GEICO Indemnity Company, GEICO CasualtyCompany, GEICO Advantage Insurance Company, GEICO Choice Insurance Company, GEICO Secure Insurance Company,GEICO County Mutual Insurance Company, GEICO Texas County Mutual Insurance Company and GEICO MarineInsurance Company. The GEICO companies primarily offer private passenger automobile insurance to individuals in all 50states and the District of Columbia. GEICO also provides insurance for motorcycles, all-terrain vehicles, recreationalvehicles, boats and small commercial fleets and acts as an agent for other insurers who offer homeowners, renters, life andidentity management insurance to individuals who desire insurance coverages other than those offered by GEICO.\fK-4GEICO’s marketing is primarily through direct response methods in which applications for insurance are submitteddirectly to the companies via the Internet or by telephone, and to a lesser extent, through captive agents. GEICO conductsbusiness through regional service centers and claims adjustment and other facilities in 39 states.The automobile insurance business is highly competitive in the areas of price and service. GEICO competes for privatepassenger automobile insurance customers in the preferred, standard and non-standard risk markets with other companies thatsell directly to the customer and with companies that use agency sales forces, including State Farm, Allstate, Progressive andUSAA. GEICO’s advertising campaigns and competitive rates contributed to a cumulative increase in voluntary policies-in-force of approximately 26.0% over the past five years. According to the most recently published A.M. Best data for 2020, thefive largest automobile insurers had a combined market share in 2020 of approximately 59.7% based on written premiums,with GEICO’s market share being the second largest at approximately 13.5%. GEICO’s written premiums in 2020 werereduced by the effects of the GEICO Giveback Program implemented in response to significant reductions in claimfrequencies attributable to reduced policyholder driving during the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic. Pandemic-related premium credit programs of other private passenger insurers may not have been reported as premium reductions,which impacts the industry data reported by A.M Best. Since the publication of that data, GEICO’s management estimates itscurrent market share is approximately 14.2%. Seasonal variations in GEICO’s insurance business are not significant.However, extraordinary weather conditions or other factors may have a significant effect upon the frequency or severity ofautomobile claims.State insurance departments stringently regulate private passenger auto insurance. As a result, it is difficult forinsurance companies to differentiate their products. Competition for private passenger automobile insurance, which issubstantial, tends to focus on price and level of customer service provided. GEICO’s cost-efficient direct response marketingmethods and emphasis on customer satisfaction enable it to offer competitive rates and value to its customers.

BHRG conducts business activities in 24 countries. Reinsurance business iswritten through NICO and certain other Berkshire insurance subsidiaries (collectively, the “NICO Group”) and General ReCorporation, domiciled in Delaware, and its subsidiaries (collectively the “General Re Group”). BHRG’s underwritingoperations in the U.S. are based in Stamford, Connecticut.The type and volume of business written is dependent on market conditions, including prevailing premium rates andcoverage terms. The level of underwriting activities often fluctuates significantly from year to year depending on theperceived level of price adequacy in specific insurance and reinsurance markets as well as from the timing of particularlylarge reinsurance transactions.Property/casualtyThe NICO Group offers traditional property/casualty reinsurance on both an excess-of-loss and a quota-share basis,catastrophe excess-of-loss treaty and facultative reinsurance, and primary insurance on an excess-of-loss basis for large orunusual risks. The type and volume of business written by the NICO Group may vary significantly from period to periodresulting from changes in perceived premium rate adequacy and from unique or large transactions. A significant portion ofNICO Group’s annual reinsurance premium volume currently derives from a 20% quota-share agreement with InsuranceAustralia Group Limited (“IAG”) that expires July 1, 2025. IAG is a multi-line insurer in Australia, New Zealand and otherAsia-Pacific countries.The General Re Group conducts a global property and casualty reinsurance business. Reinsurance contracts are writtenon both a quota-share and excess basis for multiple lines of business. Contracts are primarily in the form of treaties, and to alesser degree, on a facultative basis. General Re Group conducts business in North America primarily through GeneralReinsurance Corporation (“GRC”), which is licensed in the District of Columbia and all states, except Hawaii, where it is anaccredited reinsurer. GRC conducts operations in North America from its headquarters in Stamford, Connecticut and through12 branch offices in the U.S. and Canada.In North America, the General Re Group includes General Star National Insurance Company, General Star IndemnityCompany and Genesis Insurance Company, which offer a broad array of specialty and surplus lines and property, casualtyand professional liability coverages. Such business is marketed through a select group of wholesale brokers, managinggeneral underwriters and program administrators, and offer solutions for the unique needs of public entity, commercial andcaptive customers.General Re Group’s international reinsurance business is conducted on a direct basis through General Reinsurance AG,based in Cologne, Germany, and through several other subsidiaries and branches in numerous other countries. Internationalbusiness is also written through brokers, including Faraday Underwriting Limited (“Faraday”), a wholly-owned subsidiary.Faraday owns the managing agent of Syndicate 435 at Lloyd’s of London and provides capacity and participates in 100% ofthe results of Syndicate 435.Life/healthThe General Re Group also conducts a global life and health reinsurance business. In the U.S. and internationally, theGeneral Re Group writes life, disability, supplemental health, critical illness and long-term care coverages. The life/healthbusiness is marketed on a direct basis. Life/health net premiums written by the General Re Group in 2021 were primarily inthe Asia Pacific, United States and Western Europe.Berkshire Hathaway Life Insurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”), a subsidiary of NICO, and its affiliates writereinsurance covering various forms of traditional life insurance exposures and, on a limited basis, health insurance exposures.BHLN and affiliates are parties to contracts that reinsure certain guaranteed minimum death, income and similar benefit riskson closed-blocks of variable annuity risks under reinsurance contracts, with the most recent contract incepting in 2014.\fK-6Retroactive reinsuranceNICO also periodically writes retroactive reinsurance contracts. Retroactive reinsurance contracts indemnify cedingcompanies against the adverse development of claims arising from loss events that have already occurred under property andcasualty policies issued in prior years. Coverages under such contracts are provided on an excess basis (above a statedretention) or for losses payable after the inception of the contract with no additional ceding company retention. Contracts arenormally subject to aggregate limits of indemnification, which can be exceptionally large in amount. Significant amounts ofasbestos, environmental and latent injury claims may arise under these contracts.The concept of time-value-of-money is an important element in establishing retroactive reinsurance contract prices andterms since loss payments may occur over decades. Normally, expected ultimate losses payable under these policies areexpected to exceed premiums, thus producing underwriting losses. Nevertheless, this business is written, in part, because ofthe large amounts of policyholder funds generated for investment, the economic benefit of which will be reflected throughinvestment results in future periods.Periodic payment annuityBHLN writes periodic payment annuity insurance policies and reinsures existing annuity-like obligations. Under thesepolicies, BHLN receives upfront premiums and agrees in the future to make periodic payments that often extend for decades.These policies generally relate to the settlement of underlying personal injury or workers’ compensation cases of otherinsurers, known as structured settlements. Consistent with retroactive reinsurance contracts, time-value-of-money conceptsare an important factor in establishing annuity premiums, and underwriting losses are expected from the periodic accretion oftime-value discounted liabilities.Investments of insurance businesses—Berkshire’s insurance subsidiaries hold significant levels of invested assets.Investment portfolios are primarily managed by Berkshire’s Chief Executive Officer. Investments include a very largeportfolio of publicly traded equity securities, which are concentrated in relatively few issuers, as well as fixed maturitysecurities and cash and short-term investments. Generally, there are no targeted allocations by investment type or attempts tomatch investment asset and insurance liability durations. However, investment portfolios have historically included a muchgreater proportion of equity securities than is customary in the insurance industry.Invested assets derive from shareholder capital as well as funds provided from policyholders through insurance andreinsurance business (“float”). Float is the approximate amount of net policyholder funds generated through underwritingactivities that is available for investment. The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, life,annuity and health benefit liabilities, unearned premiums and other policyholder liabilities less premium and reinsurancereceivables, deferred policy acquisition costs and deferred charges on assumed retroactive reinsurance contracts. On aconsolidated basis, float has grown from approximately $91 billion at the end of 2016 to approximately $147 billion at theend of 2021. The cost of float can be measured as the net pre-tax underwriting loss as a percentage of average float. In eachof the three years ending December 31, 2021, Berkshire’s consolidated cost of float was negative, as its insurance businessesproduced net underwriting gains.Railroad Business—Burlington Northern Santa FeBurlington Northern Santa Fe, LLC (“BNSF”) is based in Fort Worth, Texas, and through BNSF Railway Company(“BNSF Railway”) operates one of the largest railroad systems in North America. BNSF Railway had approximately 35,000employees at the end of 2021. BNSF also operates a relatively smaller third-party logistics services business.In serving the Midwest, Pacific Northwest, Western, Southwestern and Southeastern regions and ports of the UnitedStates, BNSF transports a range of products and commodities derived from manufacturing, agricultural and natural resourceindustries. Freight revenues are covered by contractual agreements of varying durations or common carrier published pricesor company quotations. BNSF’s financial performance is influenced by, among other things, general and industry economicconditions at the international, national and regional levels.BNSF’s primary routes, including trackage rights, allow it to access major cities and ports in the western and southernUnited States as well as parts of Canada and Mexico. In addition to major cities and ports, BNSF Railway efficiently servesmany smaller markets by working closely with approximately 200 shortline railroads. BNSF Railway has also entered intomarketing agreements with other rail carriers, expanding the marketing reach for each railroad and their customers. For theyear ending December 31, 2021, approximately 38% of freight revenues were derived from consumer products, 24% fromindustrial products, 23% from agricultural products and 15% from coal.\fK-7Regulatory MattersBNSF is subject to federal, state and local laws and regulations generally applicable to its businesses. Rail operationsare subject to the regulatory jurisdiction of the Surface Transportation Board (“STB”), the Federal Railroad Administration ofthe United States Department of Transportation (“DOT”), the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (“OSHA”), aswell as other federal and state regulatory agencies and Canadian regulatory agencies for operations in Canada. The STB hasjurisdiction over disputes and complaints involving certain rates, routes and services, the sale or abandonment of rail lines,applications for line extensions and construction, and the merger with or acquisition of control of rail common carriers. Theoutcome of STB proceedings can affect the profitability of BNSF Railway’s business.The DOT and OSHA have jurisdiction under several federal statutes over a number of safety and health aspects of railoperations, including the transportation of hazardous materials. BNSF Railway is required to transport these materials to theextent of its common carrier obligation. State agencies regulate some aspects of rail operations with respect to health andsafety in areas not otherwise preempted by federal law.Environmental MattersBNSF’s rail operations, as well as those of its competitors, are also subject to extensive federal, state and localenvironmental regulation covering discharges to the ground or waters, air emissions, toxic substances and the generation,handling, storage, transportation and disposal of waste and hazardous materials. Such regulations effectively increase thecosts and liabilities associated with rail operations. Environmental risks are also inherent in rail operations, which frequentlyinvolve transporting chemicals and other hazardous materials.Many of BNSF’s land holdings are or have been used for industrial or transportation-related purposes or leased tocommercial or industrial companies whose activities may have resulted in discharges onto the property. Under federal (inparticular, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act) and state statutes, BNSF may beheld jointly and severally liable for cleanup and enforcement costs associated with a particular site without regard to fault orthe legality of the original conduct. BNSF may also be subject to claims by third parties for investigation, cleanup, restorationor other environmental costs under environmental statutes or common law with respect to properties they own that have beenimpacted by BNSF operations.Consumption of diesel fuel by locomotives accounted for approximately 80% of BNSF’s greenhouse gas (“GHG”)emissions in its baseline year of 2018. BNSF management has committed to a broad sustainability model, applying science-based approaches, that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF’s GHG-emissions by 2030 from its baseline year of 2018.BNSF intends to continue improvements in fuel efficiency and increased utilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-termsolutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, are also being evaluated and field-tested.CompetitionThe business environment in which BNSF operates is highly competitive. Depending on the specific market,deregulated motor carriers and other railroads, as well as river barges, ships and pipelines, may exert pressure on price andservice levels. The presence of advanced, high service truck lines with expedited delivery, subsidized infrastructure andminimal empty mileage continues to affect the market for non-bulk, time-sensitive freight. The potential expansion of longercombination vehicles could further encroach upon markets traditionally served by railroads. In order to remain competitive,BNSF Railway and other railroads seek to develop and implement operating efficiencies to improve productivity.As railroads streamline, rationalize and otherwise enhance their franchises, competition among rail carriers intensifies.BNSF Railway’s primary rail competitor in the Western region of the United States is the Union Pacific Railroad Company.Other Class I railroads and numerous regional railroads and motor carriers also operate in parts of the same territories servedby BNSF Railway.Utilities and Energy Businesses—Berkshire Hathaway EnergyBerkshire currently has a 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”).

These independent power projects sell power generated primarily from wind, solar, geothermaland hydro sources under long-term contracts. Additionally, $6.9 billion has been invested in wind projects sponsored by thirdparties, commonly referred to as tax equity investments.\fK-9Regulatory MattersPacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are subject to comprehensive regulation by various federal, state and localagencies. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (“FERC”) is an independent agency with broad authority toimplement provisions of the Federal Power Act, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 and other federal statutes. The FERCregulates rates for wholesale sales of electricity; transmission of electricity, including pricing and regional planning for theexpansion of transmission systems; electric system reliability; utility holding companies; accounting and records retention;securities issuances; construction and operation of hydroelectric facilities; and other matters. The FERC also has theenforcement authority to assess civil penalties of up to $1.4 million per day per violation of rules, regulations and ordersissued under the Federal Power Act. MEC is also subject to regulation by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission pursuant tothe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended, with respect to its 25% ownership of the Quad Cities Nuclear Station.With certain limited exceptions, BHE’s domestic utilities have an exclusive right to serve retail customers within theirservice territories and, in turn, have an obligation to provide service to those customers. In some jurisdictions, certain classesof customers may choose to purchase all or a portion of their energy from alternative energy suppliers, and in somejurisdictions retail customers can generate all or a portion of their own energy. Historically, state regulatory commissionshave established retail electric and natural gas rates on a cost-of-service basis, designed to allow a utility the opportunity torecover what each state regulatory commission deems to be the utility’s reasonable costs of providing services, including afair opportunity to earn a reasonable return on its investments based on its cost of debt and equity. The retail electric rates ofPacifiCorp, MEC and the Nevada Utilities are generally based on the cost of providing traditional bundled services, includinggeneration, transmission and distribution services; however, rates are available for transmission-only and distribution-onlyservices.Northern Powergrid (Northeast) and Northern Powergrid (Yorkshire) each charge fees for the use of their distributionsystems that are controlled by a formula prescribed by the British electricity regulatory body, the Gas and Electricity MarketsAuthority. The current eight-year price control period runs from April 1, 2015 through March 31, 2023.AltaLink is regulated by the Alberta Utilities Commission (“AUC”), pursuant to the Electric Utilities Act (Alberta), thePublic Utilities Act (Alberta), the Alberta Utilities Commission Act (Alberta) and the Hydro and Electric Energy Act(Alberta). The AUC is an independent quasi-judicial agency, which regulates and oversees Alberta’s electricity transmissionsector with broad authority that may impact many of AltaLink’s activities, including its tariffs, rates, construction, operationsand financing. Under the Electric Utilities Act, AltaLink prepares and files applications with the AUC for approval of tariffsto be paid by the Alberta Electric System Operator (“AESO”) for the use of its transmission facilities, and the terms andconditions governing the use of those facilities. The AESO is an independent system operator in Alberta, Canada thatoversees Alberta’s integrated electrical system (“AIES”) and wholesale electricity market. The AESO is responsible fordirecting the safe, reliable and economic operation of the AIES, including long-term transmission system planning.The natural gas pipelines are subject to regulation by various federal and state agencies. The natural gas pipeline andstorage operations of BHE GT&S, Northern Natural and Kern River are regulated by the FERC pursuant to the Natural GasAct and the Natural Gas Policy Act of 1978. Under this authority, the FERC regulates, among other items, (a) rates, charges,terms and conditions of service; (b) the construction and operation of interstate pipelines, storage and related facilities,including the extension, expansion or abandonment of such facilities; and (c) the construction and operation of liquefiednatural gas import/export facilities. Interstate natural gas pipeline companies are also subject to regulations administered bythe Office of Pipeline Safety within the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, an agency of the DOT.Federal pipeline safety regulations are issued pursuant to the Natural Gas Pipeline Safety Act of 1968, as amended, whichestablishes safety requirements in the design, construction, operation and maintenance of interstate natural gas pipelinefacilities.Environmental MattersBHE and its energy businesses are subject to federal, state, local and foreign laws and regulations regarding climatechange, renewable portfolio standards, air and water quality, emissions performance standards, coal combustion byproductdisposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and other environmental matters that have the potential toimpact current and future operations. In addition to imposing continuing compliance obligations, these laws and regulations,such as the Federal Clean Air Act, provide regulators with the authority to levy substantial penalties for noncompliance,including fines, injunctive relief and other sanctions.The Federal Clean Air Act, as well as state laws and regulations impacting air emissions, provides a framework forprotecting and improving the nation’s air quality and controlling sources of air emissions. These laws and regulationscontinue to be promulgated and implemented and will impact the operation of BHE’s generating facilities and require them toreduce emissions at those facilities to comply with the requirements.\fK-10Renewable portfolio standards have been established by certain state governments and generally require electricityproviders to obtain a minimum percentage of their power from renewable energy resources by a certain date. Utah, Oregon,Washington, California, Iowa and Nevada have adopted renewable portfolio standards. In addition, the potential adoption ofstate or federal clean energy standards, which include low-carbon, non-carbon and renewable electricity generating resources,may also impact electricity generators and natural gas providers.In December 2015, an international agreement was negotiated by 195 nations to create a universal framework forcoordinated action on climate change in what is referred to as the Paris Agreement. The Paris Agreement reaffirms the goalof limiting global temperature increase well below 2 degrees Celsius, while urging efforts to limit the increase to 1.5 degreesCelsius; establishes commitments by all parties to make nationally determined contributions and pursue domestic measuresaimed at achieving the commitments; commits all countries to submit emissions inventories and report regularly on theiremissions and progress made in implementing and achieving their nationally determined commitments; and commits allcountries to submit new commitments every five years, with the expectation that the commitments will get more aggressive.In the context of the Paris Agreement, the United States agreed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions 26% to 28% by 2025from 2005 levels. The Paris Agreement formally entered into force on November 4, 2016. The United States completed itswithdrawal from the Paris Agreement on November 4, 2020. President Biden accepted the terms of the climate agreement onJanuary 21, 2021, and the United States completed its reentry on February 19, 2021. New commitments to the ParisAgreement were announced in April 2021, with the United States pledging to cut its overall greenhouse gas emissions by 50-52% below 2005 levels by 2030 and to reach 100% carbon pollution-free electricity by 2035.On October 10, 2017, the Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued a proposal to repeal the Clean Power Plan,which was intended to achieve an overall reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from existing fossil-fueled electricgenerating units of 32% below 2005 levels. On June 19, 2019, the EPA repealed the Clean Power Plan and issued theAffordable Clean Energy rule, which fully replaced the Clean Power Plan. In the Affordable Clean Energy rule, the EPAdetermined that the best system of emissions reduction for existing coal fueled power plants is heat rate improvements andidentified a set of candidate technologies and measures that could improve heat rates. Measures taken to meet the standardsof performance must be achieved at the source itself. On January 19, 2021, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals vacated theAffordable Clean Energy Rule in its entirety. In October 2021, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear an appeal of thatdecision. Arguments in the case will be held in February 2022 and a decision regarding the scope of the EPA’s authority toregulate greenhouse gas emissions under the Clean Air Act is expected by June 2022. Increasingly, states are adoptinglegislation and regulations to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and local governments and consumers are seeking increasingamounts of clean and renewable energy.BHE and its energy subsidiaries continue to focus on delivering reliable, affordable, safe and clean energy to itscustomers and on actions to mitigate its greenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions. BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is thegeneration of electricity from its power plants that are fueled by coal or natural gas. In managing its electricity generation,BHE works with its regulators to protect the energy and economic needs of customers by considering costs, reliability andsources of electric generation. Over the years, BHE has invested heavily in owned wind, solar and geothermal generation,with cumulative investments of $30.1 billion through 2021 and has retired 16 coal generation units. As a result, BHE hasreduced its annual GHG emissions by about 20% from 2005 levels. BHE plans to continue investing in wind, solar and otherlow-carbon generation in the future and to retire an additional 16 coal generation units between 2022 and 2030 in a reliableand cost-effective manner, thereby achieving a 50% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 levels in 2030.Non-Energy BusinessesHomeServices of America, Inc.

The majority of PCC’s sales arefrom customer orders or demand schedules pursuant to long-term agreements. Contractual terms may provide for terminationby the customer, subject to payment for work performed. PCC typically does not experience significant order cancellations,although periodically it receives requests for delays in delivery schedules. Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in2020, delay requests increased, with delivery dates extending in some cases beyond 2021.The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic produced significant adverse effects on the PCC aerospace business in 2020and 2021. The sudden and material reductions in air travel led to aircraft build rate reductions and customer destocking atextraordinary rates. The grounding of the Boeing 737 MAX also adversely impacted 2020 and 2021 and quality issues withthe Boeing 787 negatively impacted 2021. Aircraft build rates have not recovered in any meaningful way. During 2020, PCCsignificantly reduced its worldwide workforce by about 40% to help align operations to reduced aircraft build rates. Therestructuring actions taken began to improve margins in late 2020 and further margin improvements were achieved in 2021.\fK-12PCC is subject to substantial competition in all of its markets. Components and similar products may be produced bycompetitors, who use either the same types of manufacturing processes as PCC or other processes. Although PCC believes itsmanufacturing processes, technology and experience provide advantages to its customers, such as high quality, competitiveprices and physical properties that often meet more stringent demands, alternative forms of manufacturing can be used toproduce many of the same components and products. Despite intense competition, PCC is a leading supplier in most of itsprincipal markets. Several factors, including long-standing customer relationships, technical expertise, state-of-the-artfacilities and dedicated employees, aid PCC in maintaining competitive advantages.Several raw materials used in PCC products, including certain metals such as nickel, titanium, cobalt, tantalum andmolybdenum, are found in only a few parts of the world. These metals are required for the alloys used in manufacturedproducts. The availability and costs of these metals may be influenced by private or governmental cartels, changes in worldpolitics, labor relations between the metal producers and their workforces and inflation.PCC is currently subject to various federal, state and foreign environmental laws concerning, among other things,water discharges, air emissions, waste management, toxic materials use reduction and environmental cleanup. Laws andregulations continue to evolve, and it is reasonably possible that environmental standards will become more stringent in thefuture, particularly under air quality and water quality laws and standards related to climate change, including reporting ofgreenhouse gas emissions. As a result, it is also reasonably likely that PCC will be regularly required to make additionalexpenditures, including capital expenditures, which could be significant, relating to environmental matters.LubrizolThe Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”) is a specialty chemical and performance materials company that manufacturesproducts and supplies technologies for the global transportation, industrial and consumer markets.

Approximately 90% of BHA’s annual revenues are fromdealerships representing these manufacturers.The retail automotive industry is highly competitive. BHA faces competition from other large public and privatedealership groups, as well as individual franchised dealerships and competition via the Internet. Given the pricingtransparency available via the Internet, and the fact that franchised dealers acquire vehicles from the manufacturers on thesame terms irrespective of volume, the location and quality of the dealership facility, customer service and transaction speedare key differentiators in attracting customers.BHA’s overall relationships with the automobile manufacturers are governed by framework agreements. Theframework agreements contain provisions relating to the management, operation, acquisition and ownership structure ofBHA’s dealerships.

Risk FactorsBerkshire and its subsidiaries (referred to herein as “we,” “us,” “our” or similar expressions) are subject to certain risksand uncertainties in its business operations which are described below. The risks and uncertainties described below are notthe only risks we face. Additional risks and uncertainties that are presently unknown or are currently deemed immaterial mayalso impair our business operations.General Business RisksTerrorist acts could hurt our operating businesses.A cyber, biological, nuclear or chemical attack could produce significant losses to our worldwide operations. Ourbusiness operations could be adversely affected from such acts through the loss of human resources or destruction ofproduction facilities and information systems. We share the risk with all businesses.Cyber security risksWe rely on technology in virtually all aspects of our business. Like those of many large businesses, certain of ourinformation systems have been subject to computer viruses, malicious codes, unauthorized access, phishing efforts, denial-of-service attacks and other cyber-attacks and we expect to be subject to similar attacks in the future as such attacks becomemore sophisticated and frequent. A significant disruption or failure of our technology systems could result in serviceinterruptions, safety failures, security events, regulatory compliance failures, an inability to protect information and assetsagainst unauthorized users and other operational difficulties. Attacks perpetrated against our systems could result in loss ofassets and critical information and expose us to remediation costs and reputational damage.Although we have taken steps intended to mitigate these risks, including business continuity planning, disasterrecovery planning and business impact analysis, a significant disruption or cyber intrusion at one or more of our significantoperations could adversely affect our results of operations, financial condition and liquidity. Additionally, if we are unable toacquire, develop, implement, adopt or protect rights around new technology, we may suffer a competitive disadvantage,which could also have an adverse effect on our results of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.Cyber-attacks could further adversely affect our ability to operate facilities, information technology and businesssystems or compromise confidential customer and employee information. Political, economic, social or financial marketinstability or damage to or interference with our operating assets, customers or suppliers from cyber-attacks may result inbusiness interruptions, lost revenues, higher commodity prices, disruption in fuel supplies, lower energy consumption,unstable markets, increased security, repair or other costs, or may materially adversely affect us in ways that cannot bepredicted at this time. Any of these risks could materially affect our consolidated financial results. Furthermore, instability inthe financial markets resulting from terrorism, sustained or significant cyber-attacks or war could also have a materialadverse effect on our ability to raise capital. We share these risks with all businesses.We are dependent on a few key people for our major investment and capital allocation decisions.Major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions are made by Warren E. Buffett, Chairman of theBoard of Directors and Chief Executive Officer, age 91, in consultation with Charles T. Munger, Vice Chairman of the Boardof Directors, age 98. In 2018, Berkshire’s Board of Directors appointed Mr. Gregory Abel as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’snon-insurance operations and Mr. Ajit Jain as Vice Chairman of Berkshire’s insurance operations. Mr. Abel and Mr. Jaineach report directly to Mr. Buffett. Mr. Buffett continues to be responsible for major capital allocation and investmentdecisions.If for any reason the services of our key personnel, particularly Mr. Buffett, were to become unavailable, there could bea material adverse effect on our operations. Should a replacement for Mr. Buffett be needed currently, Berkshire’s Board ofDirectors has agreed that Mr. Abel should replace Mr. Buffett. The Board continually monitors this risk and could alter itscurrent view regarding a replacement for Mr. Buffett in the future. We believe that the Board’s succession plan, together withthe outstanding managers running our numerous and highly diversified operating units helps to mitigate this risk.\fK-25We need qualified personnel to manage and operate our various businesses.In our decentralized business model, we need qualified and competent management to direct day-to-day businessactivities of our operating subsidiaries and to manage changes in future business operations due to changing business orregulatory environments. Our operating subsidiaries also need qualified and competent personnel in executing their businessplans and serving their customers, suppliers and other stakeholders. Our inability to recruit and retain qualified andcompetent managers and personnel could negatively affect the operating results, financial condition and liquidity of oursubsidiaries and Berkshire as a whole.Investments are unusually concentrated in equity securities and fair values are subject to loss in value.We concentrate a high percentage of the equity security investments of our insurance subsidiaries in a relatively smallnumber of equity securities. A significant decline in the fair values of our larger investments in equity securities may producea material decline in our consolidated shareholders’ equity and our consolidated earnings.Since a large percentage of our equity securities are held by our insurance subsidiaries, significant decreases in the fairvalues of these investments will produce significant declines in the statutory surplus of our insurance business. Our largestatutory surplus is a competitive advantage, and a long-term material decline could have an adverse effect on our claims-paying ability ratings and our ability to write new insurance business thus potentially reducing our future underwritingprofits.Competition and technology may erode our business franchises and result in lower earnings.Each of our operating businesses face intense competition within markets in which they operate. While we manage ourbusinesses with the objective of achieving long-term sustainable growth by developing and strengthening competitiveadvantages, many factors, including technological changes, may erode or prevent the strengthening of competitiveadvantages. Accordingly, our future operating results will depend to some degree on our operating units successfullyprotecting and enhancing their competitive advantages. If our operating businesses are unsuccessful in these efforts, ourperiodic operating results in the future may decline.Unfavorable general economic conditions may significantly reduce our operating earnings and impair our ability toaccess capital markets at a reasonable cost.Our operating businesses are subject to normal economic cycles affecting the general economy or the specificindustries in which they operate. Significant deteriorations of economic conditions over a prolonged period could produce amaterial adverse effect on one or more of our significant operations. In addition, our utilities and energy businesses and ourrailroad business regularly utilize debt as a component of their capital structures and depend on having access to borrowedfunds through the capital markets at reasonable rates. To the extent that access to the capital markets is restricted or the costof funding increases, these operations could be adversely affected.Epidemics, pandemics or other outbreaks, including COVID-19, could hurt our operating businesses.The outbreak of COVID-19 has adversely affected, and in the future it or other epidemics, pandemics or outbreaks mayadversely affect, our operations, including our equity securities portfolio. This is or may be due to closures or restrictionsrequested or mandated by governmental authorities, disruption to supply chains and workforce, reduction of demand for ourproducts and services, credit losses when customers and other counterparties fail to satisfy their obligations to us, andvolatility in global equity securities markets, among other factors. We share most of these risks with all businesses.Regulatory changes may adversely impact our future operating results.Over time, in response to financial markets crises, global economic recessions, and social and environmental issues,regulatory initiatives were adopted in the United States and elsewhere. Such initiatives addressed for example, the regulationof banks and other major financial institutions, products and environmental and global-warming matters. These initiativesimpact all of our businesses, albeit in varying ways. Increased regulatory compliance costs could have a significant negativeimpact on our operating businesses, as well as on the businesses in which we have a significant, but not controlling economicinterests. We cannot predict whether such initiatives will have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financialposition, results of operations and/or cash flows.Data privacy regulations have recently been enacted in various jurisdictions in the U.S. and throughout the world.These regulations address numerous aspects related to the security of personal information that is stored in our informationsystems, networks and facilities. Failure to comply with these regulations could result in reputational damage and significantpenalties.\fK-26Risks unique to our regulated businessesOur tolerance for risk in our insurance businesses may result in significant underwriting losses.When properly paid for the risk assumed, we have been and will continue to be willing to assume more risk from asingle event than any other insurer has knowingly assumed. Accordingly, we could incur a significant loss from a singlecatastrophe event resulting from a natural disaster or man-made catastrophes such as terrorism or cyber-attacks. We employvarious disciplined underwriting practices intended to mitigate potential losses and attempt to take into account all possiblecorrelations and avoid writing groups of policies from which pre-tax losses from a single catastrophe event might aggregateabove $10 billion. However, despite our efforts, it is possible that losses could manifest in ways that we do not anticipate andthat our risk mitigation strategies are not designed to address. Additionally, various provisions of our policies, such aslimitations or exclusions from coverage, negotiated to limit our risks, may not be enforceable in the manner we intend. Ourtolerance for significant insurance losses may result in lower reported earnings in a future period.The degree of estimation error inherent in the process of estimating property and casualty insurance loss reservesmay result in significant underwriting losses.The principal cost associated with the property and casualty insurance business is claims. In writing property andcasualty insurance policies, we receive premiums today and promise to pay covered losses in the future. However, it will takedecades before all claims that have occurred as of any given balance sheet date will be reported and settled. Although webelieve that liabilities for unpaid losses are adequate, we will not know whether these liabilities or the premiums charged forthe coverages provided were sufficient until well after the balance sheet date. Estimating insurance claim costs is inherentlyimprecise. Our estimated unpaid losses arising under contracts covering property and casualty insurance risks are large ($125billion at December 31, 2021), and a small percentage increase to those liabilities can result in materially lower reportedearnings.Climate change may impact our businesses.Climate change could cause increases in hurricanes, floods, wildfires, and other risks that could produce lossesaffecting our businesses. Also, failure to comply with new or existing regulations or reinterpretations of existing regulationsrelating to climate change could have a significant adverse effect on our financial results.Changes in regulations and regulatory actions can adversely affect our operating results and our ability to allocatecapital.Our insurance businesses are subject to regulation in the jurisdictions in which we operate. Such regulations may relateto among other things, the types of business that can be written, the rates that can be charged for coverage, the level of capitalthat must be maintained, and restrictions on the types and size of investments that can be made. Regulations may also restrictthe timing and amount of dividend payments to Berkshire by these businesses. U.S. state insurance regulators andinternational insurance regulators are also actively developing various regulatory mechanisms to address the regulation oflarge internationally active insurance groups, including regulations concerning group capital, liquidity, governance and riskmanagement. Accordingly, changes in regulations related to these or other matters or regulatory actions imposing restrictionson our insurance businesses may adversely impact our results of operations and restrict our ability to allocate capital.Our railroad business conducted through BNSF is also subject to a significant number of laws and regulations withrespect to rates and practices, taxes, railroad operations and a variety of health, safety, labor, environmental and othermatters. Failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could have a material adverse effect on BNSF’s business.Governments may change the legislative and/or regulatory framework within which BNSF operates, without providing anyrecourse for any adverse effects that the change may have on the business. Complying with legislative and regulatory changesmay pose significant operating and implementation risks and require significant capital expenditures.BNSF derives significant amounts of revenue from the transportation of energy-related commodities, particularly coal.To the extent that changes in government policies limit or restrict the usage of coal as a source of fuel in generatingelectricity or alternate fuels, such as natural gas, or displace coal on a competitive basis, revenues and earnings could beadversely affected. As a common carrier, BNSF is also required to transport toxic inhalation hazard chemicals and otherhazardous materials. A release of hazardous materials could expose BNSF to significant claims, losses, penalties andenvironmental remediation obligations. Changes in the regulation of the rail industry could negatively impact BNSF’s abilityto determine prices for rail services and to make capital improvements to its rail network, resulting in an adverse effect on ourresults of operations, financial condition and/or liquidity.\fK-27Our utilities and energy businesses operated under BHE are highly regulated by numerous federal, state, local andforeign governmental authorities in the jurisdictions in which they operate. These laws and regulations are complex, dynamicand subject to new interpretations or change. Regulations affect almost every aspect of our utilities and energy businesses.Regulations broadly apply and may limit management’s ability to independently make and implement decisions regardingnumerous matters including: acquiring businesses; constructing, acquiring, disposing or retiring of operating assets; operatingand maintaining generating facilities and transmission and distribution system assets; complying with pipeline safety andintegrity and environmental requirements; setting rates charged to customers; establishing capital structures and issuing debt;managing and reporting transactions between our domestic utilities and our other subsidiaries and affiliates; and payingdividends or similar distributions. Failure to comply with or reinterpretations of existing regulations and new legislation orregulations, such as those relating to air and water quality, renewable portfolio standards, emissions performance standards,climate change, coal combustion byproduct disposal, hazardous and solid waste disposal, protected species and otherenvironmental matters, or changes in the nature of the regulatory process may have a significant adverse impact on ourfinancial results.Our railroad business requires significant ongoing capital investment to improve and maintain its railroad network sothat transportation services can be safely and reliably provided to customers on a timely basis. Our utilities and energybusinesses also require significant amounts of capital to construct, operate and maintain generation, transmission anddistribution systems to meet their customers’ needs and reliability criteria. Additionally, system assets may need to beoperational for long periods of time in order to justify the financial investment. The operational or financial failure of capitalprojects may not be recoverable through rates that are charged to customers. Further, a significant portion of costs of capitalimprovements may be funded through debt issued by BNSF and BHE and their subsidiaries. Disruptions in debt capitalmarkets that restrict access to funding when needed could adversely affect the results of operations, liquidity and/or capitalresources of these businesses.Item 1B.

Legal ProceedingsBerkshire and its subsidiaries are parties in a variety of legal actions that routinely arise out of the normal course ofbusiness, including legal actions seeking to establish liability directly through insurance contracts or indirectly throughreinsurance contracts issued by Berkshire subsidiaries. Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We donot believe that such normal and routine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results ofoperations. Berkshire and certain of its subsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert ormay assert claims or seek to impose fines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of otherpending legal actions will not have a material effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.\fK-30Item 4.

Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of OperationsResults of OperationsNet earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders for each of the past three years are disaggregated in thetable that follows. Amounts are after deducting income taxes and exclude earnings attributable to noncontrolling interests (inmillions).202120202019Insurance – underwriting$728$657$325Insurance – investment income4,8075,0395,530Railroad5,9905,1615,481Utilities and energy3,4953,0912,840Manufacturing, service and retailing11,1208,3009,372Investment and derivative gains/losses62,34031,59157,445Other*1,315(11,318)424Net earnings attributable to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders$89,795$42,521$81,417∗Includes goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in 2021, $11.0 billion in2020 and $435 million in 2019, which includes our share of charges recorded by Kraft Heinz.Through our subsidiaries, we engage in numerous diverse business activities. We manage our operating businesses onan unusually decentralized basis. There are few centralized or integrated business functions. Our senior corporatemanagement team participates in and is ultimately responsible for significant capital allocation decisions, investmentactivities and the selection of the Chief Executive to head each of the operating businesses. The business segment data (Note25 to the accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements) should be read in conjunction with this discussion.The COVID-19 pandemic negatively affected most of our businesses beginning in March of 2020, with the effects todate ranging from relatively minor to severe. Earnings of most of our manufacturing, service and retailing businessesdeclined considerably, and in certain instances severely, in the second quarter of 2020. Over the second half of 2020 andcontinuing in 2021, many of these businesses experienced significant recoveries in revenues and earnings, in some instancesexceeding pre-pandemic levels. However, many of our businesses were negatively affected by ongoing global supply chaindisruptions, including those attributable to major winter storms and a hurricane in North America, which contributed tohigher input costs. We cannot reliably predict future economic effects of the pandemic or when business activities at ouroperations will completely normalize. Nor can we predict how these events will alter the future consumption patterns ofconsumers and businesses we serve.Our insurance businesses generated after-tax earnings from underwriting of $728 million in 2021, $657 million in 2020and $325 million in 2019. In each year, we generated underwriting earnings from primary insurance and underwriting lossesfrom reinsurance. Insurance underwriting results included after-tax losses from significant catastrophe events ofapproximately $2.3 billion in 2021, $750 million in 2020 and $800 million in 2019. Underwriting results in 2021 werefavorably impacted by reductions in incurred losses for prior accident years under property and casualty contracts.Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively impacted by reductions in earned premium from the GEICO Givebackprogram, higher private passenger auto claims frequencies and severities estimates and higher losses in the life reinsurancebusiness. Underwriting results in 2020 included the effects of the pandemic, arising from premium reductions from theGEICO Giveback program, reduced claims frequencies for private passenger automobile insurance and increased lossestimates for certain commercial insurance and property and casualty reinsurance business.After-tax earnings from insurance investment income in 2021 decreased 4.6% compared to 2020 and declined 8.9% in2020 versus 2019. Earnings in 2021 and 2020 were negatively affected by declines in interest rates on our substantialholdings of cash and U.S. Treasury Bills.\fK-33Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Results of Operations (Continued)After-tax earnings of our railroad business in 2021 rose 16.1% compared to 2020 and decreased 5.8% in 2020compared to 2019. The earnings increase in 2021 reflected overall higher freight volumes, higher average revenue percar/unit and improved productivity, partly offset by higher average fuel prices and volume related costs. Earnings in 2020reflected lower railroad operating revenues from lower shipping volumes, attributable to the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partly offset by lower operating costs and the effects of productivity improvements. After-tax earnings of ourutilities and energy business in 2021 increased 13.1% versus 2020 and increased 8.8% in 2020 compared to 2019. Theincrease in 2021 included higher earnings from the utilities and natural gas pipelines businesses, including the effects of abusiness acquisition, and from the real estate brokerage business, while the earnings increase in 2020 reflected increased taxbenefits from renewable energy and increased earnings from the real estate brokerage business.Earnings in 2021 from our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses increased 34.0% versus 2020 and declined11.4% in 2020 versus 2019. Many of our businesses generated significantly higher earnings in 2021 compared to 2020.While customer demand for products was relatively high during the year, several of our businesses experienced highermaterials, freight and other input costs attributable to ongoing disruptions in global supply chains. The effects of the COVID-19 pandemic have varied among our businesses relative to significance and duration.Other earnings included after-tax goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $259 million in2021, $11.0 billion in 2020 and $435 million in 2019. Such amounts included our share of impairment charges recorded byKraft Heinz. Approximately $9.8 billion of the charges in 2020 were attributable to impairments of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of Precision Castparts in 2016. Other earnings in2021 also included after-tax foreign exchange rate gains of $955 million and after-tax losses of $764 million in 2020 relatedto non-U.S. Dollar denominated debt issued by Berkshire and its U.S.-based finance subsidiary, Berkshire Hathaway FinanceCorporation (“BHFC”).Investment and derivative gains/losses in each of the three years presented predominantly derived from ourinvestments in equity securities and included significant net unrealized gains from market price changes. We believe thatinvestment and derivative gains/losses, whether realized from dispositions or unrealized from changes in market prices ofequity securities, are generally meaningless in understanding our reported quarterly or annual results or evaluating theeconomic performance of our operating businesses. These gains and losses have caused and will continue to cause significantvolatility in our periodic earnings.Insurance—UnderwritingOur management views our insurance businesses as possessing two distinct activities – underwriting and investing.Underwriting decisions are the responsibility of the unit managers, while investing decisions are the responsibility ofBerkshire’s Chairman and CEO, Warren E. Buffett and Berkshire’s corporate investment managers. Accordingly, weevaluate performance of underwriting operations without any allocation of investment income or investment gains and losses.We consider investment income as an integral component of our aggregate insurance operating results. However, we considerinvestment gains and losses, whether realized or unrealized, as non-operating. We believe that such gains and losses are notmeaningful in understanding the periodic operating results of our insurance businesses.The timing and magnitude of catastrophe losses can produce significant volatility in our periodic underwriting results,particularly with respect to our reinsurance businesses. Generally, we consider incurred losses exceeding $100 million from acurrent year catastrophic event to be significant. The significant catastrophe events in 2021 included Hurricane Ida and floodsin Europe in the third quarter, as well as Winter Storm Uri in the first quarter.Changes in estimates for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, including amounts established for occurrences inprior years, can also significantly affect our periodic underwriting results. Unpaid loss estimates, including estimates underretroactive reinsurance contracts, were approximately $125 billion as of December 31, 2021. Our periodic underwritingresults may also include significant foreign currency transaction gains and losses arising from the changes in the valuation ofnon-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S. based insurance subsidiaries due to foreign currency exchange ratefluctuations.\fK-34Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)Underwriting results of certain of our commercial insurance and reinsurance businesses were negatively affected in2021 and 2020 by estimated losses and costs associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, including incremental provisions forclaims and uncollectible premiums and incremental operating costs to maintain customer service levels. The effects of thepandemic on future periods may be affected by judicial rulings and regulatory and legislative actions pertaining to insurancecoverage and claims and by its effects on general economic activity, which we cannot reasonably estimate at this time.We provide primary insurance and reinsurance products covering property and casualty risks, as well as life and healthrisks. Our insurance and reinsurance businesses are GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group and Berkshire HathawayReinsurance Group.Underwriting results of our insurance businesses are summarized below (dollars in millions).202120202019Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss):GEICO$1,259$3,428$1,506Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group607110383Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group(930)(2,700)(1,472)Pre-tax underwriting earnings936838417Income taxes and noncontrolling interests20818192Net underwriting earnings$728$657$325Effective income tax rate22.2%21.5%24.2%GEICOGEICO writes private passenger automobile insurance, offering coverages to insureds in all 50 states and the District ofColumbia.

Beginning in the first quarter of 2020 and continuing through the first quarter of 2021, average claimsfrequencies were significantly below historical levels from the effects of less driving by policyholders during the COVID-19pandemic. These effects were partially offset by higher average claims severities and lower premiums earned from theGEICO Giveback program, which provided for a 15% premium credit to all voluntary auto and motorcycle new policies orpolicies renewing between April 8, 2020 and October 7, 2020. Starting in the second quarter of 2021, average claimsfrequencies began to increase as driving by policyholders increased. In addition, average property claims severities increaseddue to increases in used vehicle valuations.\fK-35Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)GEICO (Continued)2021 versus 2020Premiums written in 2021 increased $3.5 billion (9.9%) compared to 2020, which included a reduction ofapproximately $2.9 billion attributable to the GEICO Giveback program. Premiums earned in 2021 increased $2.6 billion(7.4%) compared to 2020. The GEICO Giveback Program reduced earned premiums by approximately $2.5 billion in 2020with the remainder of the impact included in 2021. Voluntary auto policies-in-force in 2021 were slightly higher compared to2020.Losses and loss adjustment expenses increased $5.0 billion (19.1%) compared to 2020. GEICO’s ratio of losses andloss adjustment expenses to premiums earned (the “loss ratio”) increased 8.1 percentage points compared to 2020. Theincrease in the loss ratio reflected an increase in average claims frequencies and severities and higher losses from significantcatastrophe events, partially offset by increased reductions of ultimate estimated losses for claims occurring in prior years.Claims frequencies in 2021 were higher for all coverages, including property damage and bodily injury (thirteen tofourteen percent range), personal injury (sixteen to seventeen percent range) and collision (twenty-one to twenty-two percentrange). Average claims severities in 2021 were also higher for property damage coverage (two to three percent range),collision coverage (fifteen to sixteen percent range) and bodily injury coverage (eight to ten percent range). Ultimate claimloss estimates for claims occurring in prior years were reduced approximately $1.8 billion in 2021 and $253 million in 2020,which produced corresponding reductions in losses and loss adjustment expenses. Losses incurred attributable to HurricaneIda in 2021 were $375 million, while losses in 2020 included $81 million attributable to Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S.wildfires.Underwriting expenses decreased $199 million (3.5%) compared to 2020, reflecting lower advertising expenses.GEICO’s expense ratio (underwriting expenses to premiums earned) decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2021, reflectinglower nominal expenses and higher premiums earned.2020 versus 2019Premiums written and earned in 2020 decreased $1.1 billion (3.0%) and $479 million (1.3%), respectively, comparedto 2019. The GEICO Giveback program reduced premiums written $2.9 billion and premiums earned $2.5 billion in 2020.Voluntary auto policies-in-force increased approximately 820,000 during 2020.Losses and loss adjustment expenses in 2020 decreased $2.9 billion (10.1%) compared to 2019. GEICO’s loss ratiowas 74.1%, a decrease of 7.2 percentage points compared to 2019. The decrease in the loss ratio reflected declines in claimsfrequencies, partly offset by increases in claims severities and the impact of lower premiums earned attributable to theGEICO Giveback program.Claims frequencies in 2020 were lower for property damage, bodily injury and personal injury protection coverages(twenty-eight to thirty percent range) and collision coverage (twenty-three to twenty-four percent range) compared to 2019.Average claims severities in 2020 were higher for property damage and collision coverages (eight to ten percent range) andbodily injury coverage (twelve to thirteen percent range). Losses and loss adjustment expenses included net reductions of$253 million in 2020 for decreases in the ultimate loss estimates for claims occurring in prior years compared to net increasesof $42 million in 2019. Losses incurred included $81 million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires.There were no losses from significant catastrophe events in 2019.Underwriting expenses in 2020 increased $518 million (10.1%) compared to 2019, reflecting higher employee-related,advertising and technology costs, partly offset by lower premium taxes. GEICO’s expense ratio in 2020 was 16.1%, anincrease of 1.6 percentage points compared to 2019. The expense ratio increase was primarily attributable to the decline inearned premiums from the GEICO Giveback program.\fK-36Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)Berkshire Hathaway Primary GroupThe Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group (“BH Primary”) provides a variety of commercial insurance solutions,including healthcare professional liability, workers’ compensation, automobile, general liability, property and specialtycoverages for small, medium and large clients. BH Primary’s larger insurers include Berkshire Hathaway Specialty Insurance(“BH Specialty”), Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies (“BHHC”), MedPro Group, Berkshire Hathaway GUARDInsurance Companies (“GUARD”), National Indemnity Company (“NICO Primary”) and U.S. Liability Insurance Company(“USLI”). A summary of BH Primary underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).202120202019Amount%Amount%Amount%Premiums written$12,595$10,212$9,843Premiums earned$11,575100.0 $9,615100.0 $9,165100.0Losses and loss adjustment expenses8,10770.07,12974.16,33669.1Underwriting expenses2,86124.82,37624.72,44626.7Total losses and expenses10,96894.89,50598.88,78295.8Pre-tax underwriting earnings$607$110$383Premiums written increased $2.4 billion (23.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting increases from BH Specialty(36%), MedPro Group (16%), NICO Primary (25%), GUARD (7%), BHHC (5%) and USLI (20%). The increases wereacross multiple coverages and occurred in several markets.Premiums written increased $369 million (3.7%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting increased premiums writtenfrom BH Specialty (34%) and MedPro Group (9%), partially offset by a 13% decrease in premiums written by our otherprimary insurers. The decline in volume by our other primary insurers was primarily due to lower workers’ compensation andcommercial automobile volumes and the effect of the divestiture of Applied Underwriters in October 2019.BH Primary’s loss ratios were 70.0% in 2021, 74.1% in 2020 and 69.1% in 2019. Losses and loss adjustment expensesattributable to significant catastrophe events were $402 million in 2021 from Hurricane Ida and Winter Storm Uri and $207million in 2020 from Hurricanes Laura and Sally and U.S. wildfires. Losses and loss adjustment expenses were reduced $631million in 2021, $265 million in 2020 and $499 million in 2019 for net reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for prioryears’ loss events. Losses in 2020 also included increased liabilities of $167 million attributable to the pandemic.BH Primary insurers write significant levels of commercial and professional liability and workers’ compensationinsurance and the related claim costs may be subject to high severity and long claim-tails. Accordingly, we could experiencesignificant increases in claims liabilities in the future attributable to higher-than-expected claim settlements, adverse litigationoutcomes or judicial rulings and other factors not currently anticipated.Underwriting expenses increased $485 million (20.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting the increase in business,changes in business mix and the costs associated with new product development. The expense ratio in 2021 was relativelyunchanged versus 2020. The expense ratio in 2020 declined 2.0 percentage points compared to 2019 and reflected changes inbusiness mix and the impact of the Applied Underwriters divestiture.Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance GroupThe Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (“BHRG”) offers excess-of-loss and quota-share reinsurance coverageson property and casualty risks to insurers and reinsurers worldwide through several subsidiaries, led by National IndemnityCompany (“NICO”), General Reinsurance Corporation and General Reinsurance AG. We also write life and healthreinsurance coverages through General Re Life Corporation, General Reinsurance AG and Berkshire Hathaway LifeInsurance Company of Nebraska (“BHLN”). We periodically assume property and casualty risks under retroactivereinsurance contracts written through NICO. In addition, we write periodic payment annuity contracts through BHLN.\fK-37Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Generally, we strive to generate underwriting profits. However, time-value-of-money concepts are important elementsin establishing prices for retroactive reinsurance and periodic payment annuity businesses due to the expected long durationsof the claim liabilities. We expect to incur pre-tax underwriting losses from such businesses, primarily through deferredcharge amortization and discount accretion charges.

The increase wasprimarily attributable to property coverages. Premiums written increased $2.9 billion (27.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Theincrease was primarily attributable to net new business and increased participations on renewals.Losses and loss adjustment expenses were relatively unchanged in 2021 compared to 2020, while the loss ratiodecreased 9.1 percentage points. The loss ratio was 71.9% in 2021, 81.0% in 2020 and 73.8% in 2019. Losses incurredarising from significant catastrophe events in 2021 (Hurricane Ida, flooding in Europe and Winter Storm Uri) were $2.1billion, which were partially offset by reductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $718million. Losses incurred in 2020 included $667 million from significant catastrophe events (Hurricanes Laura and Sally andU.S. wildfires), losses attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic of $964 million and increases in estimated ultimate liabilitiesfor losses occurring in prior years of $162 million. Incurred losses from significant catastrophe events during 2019 were $1.0billion and derived from Typhoons Faxai and Hagibis and various U.S. and non-U.S. wildfires, which were partially offset byreductions in estimated ultimate liabilities for losses occurring in prior years of $295 million.Underwriting expenses are primarily commissions and brokerage costs. The expense ratio in 2021 decreased 2.3percentage points compared to 2020, primarily attributable to changes in business mix and foreign currency effects.Underwriting expenses increased $533 million (20.6%) in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting the increase in premiumsearned.\fK-38Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Life/healthA summary of our life/health reinsurance underwriting results follows (dollars in millions).202120202019Amount%Amount%Amount%Premiums written$5,621$5,848$4,963Premiums earned$5,648100.0 $5,861100.0 $4,869100.0Life and health insurance benefits4,93387.34,88383.33,80078.0Underwriting expenses1,13620.299617.091018.7Total benefits and expenses6,069107.55,879100.34,71096.7Pre-tax underwriting earnings (loss)$(421)$(18)$159Life/health premiums written decreased $227 million (3.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Premiums written in 2020included $710 million from a contract that covered U.S. health risks that incepted in the fourth quarter of 2019 and did notrenew in 2021. Otherwise, premiums written in 2021 increased 9.4% versus 2020, primarily due to volume growth in theAsia Pacific region and favorable foreign currency translation effects. Underwriting results in 2021 were negatively affectedby significant increases in mortality in the U.S., South Africa, India and Latin America, attributable to the pandemic.Life/health premiums written increased $885 million (17.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019. Approximately $480 millionof the increase was attributable to the contract covering U.S. health insurance risks, and the remainder of the increase wasprimarily from volume growth in Asia and Europe. Underwriting earnings in 2020 were negatively affected by increased lifebenefits from COVID-19-related claims and from increased liabilities from changes in underlying assumptions in estimatingdisability benefit liabilities in Australia, which were mostly offset by lower other life claims and reduced losses from U.S.long-term care business that is in run-off. Results in 2019 included a one-time pre-tax underwriting gain of $163 millionattributable to an amendment of a yearly renewable term life contract.Retroactive reinsurancePre-tax underwriting losses in each year derived from the amortization of deferred charges and changes in theestimated timing and amounts of future claim payments. Underwriting results also include foreign currency exchange gainsand losses from the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of ourU.S. subsidiaries. Underwriting results included pre-tax foreign currency gains of $56 million in 2021 and losses of $139million in 2020 and $76 million in 2019.Pre-tax underwriting losses before foreign currency gains/losses were $838 million in 2021, $1.1 billion in 2020 and$1.2 billion in 2019. Estimated ultimate claim liabilities for contracts written in prior years were reduced $974 million in2021 and $399 million in 2020. After adjustments to the related unamortized deferred charges from changes in the estimatedtiming and amount of the future claim payments, such reductions produced pre-tax underwriting earnings of $142 million in2021 and $230 million in 2020.Gross unpaid losses assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts were $38.3 billion at December 31, 2021, adecline of $2.7 billion since December 31, 2020. The decline was primarily attributable to paid claims of approximately $1.9billion and the reduction in estimated ultimate claim liabilities. Unamortized deferred charges related to retroactivereinsurance contracts were $10.6 billion at December 31, 2021, a decline of $1.8 billion since December 31, 2020,attributable to the effects of the changes in the estimated timing and amount of the future claim payments and periodicamortization. Deferred charge amortization will be included in underwriting earnings over the expected remaining claimssettlement periods.\fK-39Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Insurance—Underwriting (Continued)Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Periodic payment annuityPeriodic payment annuity premiums earned increased $92 million (16.3%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which decreased$297 million (34.4%) versus 2019. Periodic payment annuity business is both price and demand sensitive. Our premiumvolumes in 2021 and 2020 were affected by pandemic-related delays in underlying claim settlements, which reduced thesupply of available business. Our volumes written may also change rapidly due to changes in prices, which are affected byprevailing interest rates, the perceived risks and durations associated with the expected annuity payments, as well as the levelof competition.Periodic payment annuity contracts normally produce pre-tax underwriting losses deriving from the recurring discountaccretion of annuity liabilities. Underwriting results also include gains or losses from the effects of changes in mortality andinterest rates and from foreign currency exchange rate changes on non-U.S. Dollar denominated liabilities of our U.S.subsidiaries. Pre-tax underwriting results included foreign currency gains of $18 million in 2021 and losses of $67 million in2020 and $40 million in 2019.Excluding foreign currency gains/losses, pre-tax underwriting losses from periodic payment annuity contracts were$526 million in 2021, $550 million in 2020 and $509 million in 2019. Pre-tax losses in 2021 were partially offset by theeffects of higher mortality and by higher interest rates applicable to settlements under certain contracts. Discounted annuityliabilities were $15.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and had a weighted average discount rate of approximately 3.9%.Variable annuityVariable annuity guarantee reinsurance contracts produced pre-tax earnings of $114 million in 2021, losses of $18million in 2020 and earnings of $167 million in 2019. The results from these contracts are affected by changes in securitiesmarkets, interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, which can be volatile, and from the periodic amortization ofexpected profit margins. The comparative increase in underwriting earnings in 2021 was primarily attributable to the neteffects of interest rate changes and, to a lesser extent, changes in securities markets.Insurance—Investment IncomeA summary of net investment income attributable to our insurance operations follows (dollars in millions).Percentage change2021202020192021 vs 20202020 vs 2019Interest and other investment income$589$1,059$2,075(44.4)%(49.0)%Dividend income5,0604,8904,5253.58.1Pre-tax net investment income5,6495,9496,600(5.0)(9.9)Income taxes and noncontrolling interests8429101,070Net investment income$4,807$5,039$5,530Effective income tax rate14.9%15.3%16.1%Interest and other investment income declined $470 million (44.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, which in turn, declined$1.0 billion (49.0%) compared to 2019. These declines were primarily due to lower income from short-term investments andfixed maturity securities. We continue to hold substantial balances of cash, cash equivalents and short-term U.S. TreasuryBills. Short-term interest rates declined over the second half of 2019 and throughout 2020. Low rates prevailed through 2021,which resulted in significantly lower interest income. Nevertheless, we believe that maintaining ample liquidity is paramountand we insist on safety over yield with respect to short-term investments.\fK-40Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Insurance—Investment Income (Continued)Dividend income included $121 million in 2021 and $26 million in 2020 from investments in preferred stock ofBerkshire Hathaway Energy. Such amounts are deducted from earnings of the utilities and energy segment. Dividend incomemay vary from period to period due to changes in the investment portfolio and the frequency and timing of dividends fromcertain investees. Dividend income increased $365 million (8.1%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarilyattributable to dividends from the investment in $10 billion liquidation value of 8% cumulative preferred stock of OccidentalPetroleum Corporation (“Occidental”) on August 8, 2019, partly offset by lower dividends from common stock investments.Invested assets of our insurance businesses derive from shareholder capital and from net liabilities under insurance andreinsurance contracts or “float.” The major components of float are unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses, includingliabilities under retroactive reinsurance contracts, life, annuity and health insurance benefit liabilities, unearned premiums andother liabilities due to policyholders, reduced by insurance premiums and reinsurance receivables, deferred charges assumedunder retroactive reinsurance contracts and deferred policy acquisition costs. Float approximated $147 billion at December31, 2021, $138 billion at December 31, 2020 and $129 billion at December 31, 2019. Our combined insurance operationsgenerated pre-tax underwriting earnings in each of the past three years, and consequently, the average cost of float for eachyear was negative.A summary of cash and investments held in our insurance businesses as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 follows (inmillions).December 31,20212020Cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills$90,688$67,082Equity securities334,907269,498Fixed maturity securities16,38620,317Other4,2966,220$446,277$363,117Fixed maturity investments as of December 31, 2021 were as follows (in millions).AmortizedcostUnrealizedgains/lossesCarryingvalueU.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies$3,278$17$3,295Foreign governments10,997(4)10,993Corporate bonds1,3504111,761Other29245337$15,917$469$16,386U.S. government obligations are rated AA+ or Aaa by the major rating agencies.

Pre-tax earnings were $7.9 billion in 2021, an increase of 15.7% from 2020. The COVID-19pandemic caused a significant economic slowdown that adversely affected our volumes in 2020. Revenue changes in 2021were driven by continued improvements from the 2020 effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by the ongoingdisruptions in the global supply chain.\fK-42Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Railroad (Continued)Operating revenues from consumer products increased 13.7% in 2021 to $8.3 billion compared to 2020, reflectingincreased volumes of 7.7% and higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarily due to growth inintermodal in both international and domestic shipments driven by increased retail sales, inventory replenishments byretailers and increased e-commerce activity.Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.3 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.0% from 2020. Volumesincreased 5.4% while average revenue per car/unit was nearly unchanged from 2020. The volume increase was primarily dueto improvement in the U.S. industrial economy, driving higher volumes in the construction and building sectors, partiallyoffset by lower petroleum volumes due to unfavorable market conditions in the energy sector.Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 5.8% to $5.1 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The revenuechange reflected a volume increase of 2.9% due to higher domestic grain shipments and higher volumes of ethanol andrelated commodities, as well as higher revenue per car/unit.Operating revenues from coal increased 21.5% to $3.2 billion in 2021 compared to 2020 attributable to higher volumesof 8.9% in 2021, as well as higher average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase in 2021 was attributable to increasedelectricity generation, higher natural gas prices and improved export demand.Railroad operating expenses were $13.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.3 billion (10.2%) compared to 2020. Theratio of railroad operating expenses to railroad operating revenues decreased 0.7 percentage points to 60.9% in 2021 versus2020. The increase in railroad operating expenses reflected higher volumes and higher average fuel prices, partially offset bythe favorable impact of productivity improvements.Compensation and benefits expenses increased $154 million (3.4%) in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily due toincreased volumes, wage inflation and health and welfare costs, partially offset by productivity improvements. Fuel expensesincreased $977 million (54.6%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher average fuel prices. Purchased service expensesincreased $79 million (4.0%) compared to 2020, primarily due to higher volumes and the effects of insurance recoveries in2020 related to 2019 flooding, partially offset by improved productivity. Equipment rents, materials and other expensesincreased $79 million (4.7%) compared to 2020, due to higher volume-related costs.2020 versus 2019Railroad operating revenues declined 11.3% in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting a 7.2% decrease in volume and a 4.5%decrease in average revenue per car/unit. The decrease in revenue per car/unit was attributable to lower fuel surchargerevenue driven by lower fuel prices and business mix changes. The overall volume decrease was primarily due to theCOVID-19 pandemic, which severely impacted volumes through the first half of 2020 and caused significant economicdisruptions that adversely affected the demand for transportation services. Volumes sequentially improved during the secondhalf of 2020 from earlier periods and recovered overall to pre-pandemic levels by the end of the year.Pre-tax earnings were $6.8 billion in 2020, a decrease of 6.3% from 2019, principally due to the negative impacts ofthe pandemic on volumes. In addition, pre-tax earnings in 2019 included an operating revenue increase related to thefavorable outcome of an arbitration hearing and a retirement plan curtailment gain that is included in other expenses, net inthe preceding table. These effects were partially offset by significant improvements in 2020 in service, system velocity andcost performance compared to 2019, along with lower costs related to severe winter weather and flooding on parts of thenetwork, which negatively affected expenses and service levels in 2019.Operating revenues from consumer products of $7.3 billion in 2020 declined 7.6% compared to 2019, primarily due toa 6.3% decrease in average revenue per car/unit along with lower volumes. The volume decrease was primarily due to theimpact of the pandemic. Lower international and automotive volumes were offset by higher domestic intermodal volumes.Increased retail sales, inventory replenishments by retailers and e-commerce activity produced recovery of intermodalvolumes in the second half of 2020.\fK-43Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Railroad (Continued)Operating revenues from industrial products were $5.0 billion in 2020, a decrease of 17.0% from 2019. The decreasewas primarily attributable to the decline in volume and to a lesser extent lower average revenue per car/unit. Volumesdecreased primarily due to lower U.S. industrial production driven by the pandemic, including reduced production anddemand in the energy sector, which lowered sand and petroleum products volume, and reduced steel demand, which loweredtaconite volume.Operating revenues from agricultural products increased 2.9% to $4.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increasewas due to higher volumes, partially offset by slightly lower average revenue per car/unit. The volume increase was primarilydue to higher grain and meal exports, partially offset by lower ethanol and sweeteners shipments.Operating revenues from coal decreased 28.5% to $2.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. This decrease was primarilydue to lower volumes, as well as lower revenues per car/unit. Volumes decreased primarily due to lower natural gas prices,lower electricity demand driven by the pandemic, utility coal plant retirements and mild temperatures.Railroad operating expenses declined 15.3% to $12.4 billion in 2020 as compared to 2019. The ratio of railroadoperating expenses to railroad operating revenues declined 2.9 percentage points to 61.6% in 2020 versus 2019. Railroadoperating expenses in 2020 reflected lower volume-related costs, productivity improvements, the effects of cost controlinitiatives and improved weather conditions compared to 2019.Compensation and benefits expenses decreased $728 million (13.8%) in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily due tolower employee counts associated with lower volume and improved workforce productivity. Fuel expenses decreased $1.2billion (39.2%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower average fuel prices, lower volumes and improved fuel efficiency.Purchased services expense declined $95 million (4.6%) compared to 2019. The decrease was primarily due to lower volume,improved productivity and higher insurance recoveries in 2020 related to network flooding in 2019. Equipment rents,materials and other expense decreased $344 million (17.0%) compared to 2019, primarily due to lower volume-related costs,the effects of cost controls and lower personal injury and derailment expenses.Utilities and EnergyWe currently own a 91.1% ownership interest in Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”), which operates aglobal energy business.

The increase reflected higher utility margin(operating revenue less cost of sales) and increased income tax benefits from the impacts of ratemaking as well as higherproduction tax credits recognized on new wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service. The earnings increase waspartially offset by lower allowances for equity and borrowed funds used during construction and higher operating expenses.Operating expenses in 2021 reflected increased depreciation expense from the impacts of a deprecation study effectiveJanuary 1, 2021, and incremental costs associated with wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, offset by lowercosts associated with wildfires and a settlement agreement.\fK-45Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Utilities and Energy (Continued)PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $145 million compared to 2020. The increasereflected higher retail revenue from increases in customer volumes and higher wholesale and other revenue, partially offsetby higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Retail customer volumes increased 3.1% in 2021 as compared to2020, primarily due to higher customer usage, an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts ofweather.MEC operates a regulated electric and natural gas utility primarily in Iowa and Illinois. After-tax earnings increased$65 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected higher electric utility margin and increased income taxbenefits, partly offset by higher operating expenses. The increase in operating expenses included incremental costs associatedwith wind-powered generating facilities placed in-service and higher natural gas distribution costs, partially offset by lowerstorm restoration costs. The income tax benefit increases were mainly due to higher production tax credits recognized on newwind-powered generating facilities placed in-service, partially offset by the impacts of ratemaking.MEC electric utility margin increased $190 million to $2.0 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The electric utilitymargin increase was attributable to higher operating revenue from increases in retail and wholesale customer volumes, aswell as favorable wholesale prices, partially offset by higher thermal generation and purchased power costs. Electric retailcustomer volumes increased 5.8% in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily due to increased usage by certain industrialcustomers and the favorable impacts of weather.NV Energy operates regulated electric and natural gas utilities in Nevada. After-tax earnings increased $29 million in2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected lower operating expenses, lower net interest and finance expense and lowerincome tax expense from the impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by lower electric utility margin. The decreases inoperating expenses were mainly due to lower earnings sharing, partially offset by higher depreciation expense fromadditional assets placed in-service.NV Energy’s electric utility margin decreased $97 million to $1.6 billion in 2021 compared to 2020. The decrease wasprimarily due to revenue reductions from lower base tariff general rates in 2021 and a favorable regulatory decision in 2020,partially offset by a 3.3% increase in electric retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes wasprimarily due to an increase in the average number of customers, higher customer usage and the favorable impacts ofweather.Northern Powergrid’s after-tax earnings increased $46 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase reflected highertariff rates and units distributed, lower write-offs of gas exploration costs, lower pension expense and favorable foreigncurrency exchange rate movements in 2021, partially offset by the impact of increases in the United Kingdom corporateincome tax rate. Earnings in 2021 included deferred income tax expense of $109 million related to the enactment in June2021 of an increase in the income tax rate from 19% to 25%, effective April 1, 2023. Earnings in 2020 included deferredincome tax expense of $35 million related to the enactment in July 2020 of an increase in the income tax rate from 17% to19%, effective April 1, 2020.Natural gas pipelines’ after-tax earnings increased $246 million in 2021 compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 includedBHE GT&S for the full year compared to two months in 2020. The incremental earnings in 2021 from BHE GT&S were$211 million. In addition, earnings in 2021 reflected the effects of higher margins on natural gas sales and highertransportation revenue at Northern Natural Gas due to increased demand from the February 2021 winter storms, partiallyoffset by lower transportation revenue primarily due to lower volumes for the remainder of the year.Other energy businesses’ after-tax earnings in 2021 decreased $17 million compared to 2020. The decrease was mainlydue to a decline in wind tax equity investment earnings of $56 million, which included increased losses from pre-existing taxequity investments of $165 million, largely attributable to the February 2021 winter storms, partially offset by increasedincome tax benefits from projects reaching commercial operation over the past twelve months. Earnings in 2021 from otherenergy projects increased due to higher operating revenue from owned renewable energy projects and a transmissioninvestment, as well as favorable foreign currency exchange rate movements in 2021.Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $12 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase was due to acomparative increase in closed brokerage transaction volumes in 2021, partially offset by lower funded mortgage volume dueto a decrease in refinance activity.Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings increased $15 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The increase wasprimarily due to favorable comparative state income tax benefits and higher earnings from non-regulated energy services,offset by higher operating expenses and higher interest expense from corporate debt issued in 2020.\fK-46Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Utilities and Energy (Continued)2020 versus 2019PacifiCorp after-tax earnings decreased $32 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decrease reflected higher operatingexpenses and net interest expense, partially offset by increased production tax credit benefits driven by repowered windprojects placed in-service, higher utility margin and higher other income. The increase in operating expenses was largely dueto costs associated with wildfires, a settlement agreement and pension benefits.PacifiCorp utility margin was $3.3 billion in 2020, an increase of $47 million compared to 2019. The increase reflectedhigher operating revenue from an increase in average retail prices and lower generation and purchased power costs, partiallyoffset by lower operating revenue from a decline in retail customer volumes. The decline in retail customer volumes was dueto the impacts of the pandemic, partly offset by an increase in the average number of customers and the favorable impacts ofweather.MEC after-tax earnings increased $37 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected increased income taxbenefits, primarily from production tax credits, driven by repowered and new wind projects placed in-service, and the effectsof ratemaking. These effects were partially offset by higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service,higher net interest expense, lower other income and lower electric and natural gas utility margins.MEC electric utility margin decreased $10 million to $1.8 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The electric utility margindecrease was attributable to lower operating revenue from unfavorable wholesale prices and price impacts from changes inretail sales mix. These effects were mostly offset by lower generation and purchased power costs and higher operatingrevenue from a 1.2% increase in retail customer volumes. The increase in electric retail customer volumes was primarily dueto increased usage by certain industrial customers, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic. Natural gas utility margindecreased $9 million in 2020 compared to 2019, due to the unfavorable impacts of weather.NV Energy after-tax earnings increased $45 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflected higher electricutility margin and lower income tax expense from the favorable impacts of ratemaking, partially offset by higher operatingexpenses. The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher earnings sharing accruals for customers at NevadaPower Company and higher depreciation expense from additional assets placed in-service.NV Energy electric utility margin increased $100 million to $1.7 billion in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase wasprimarily due to higher operating revenue from a 1.5% increase in electric retail customer volumes, including distribution-only service customers and price impacts from changes in retail sales mix. The increase in electric retail customer volumeswas primarily due to the favorable impacts of weather, partially offset by the impacts of the pandemic.Northern Powergrid after-tax earnings decreased $55 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The earnings decreasereflected write-offs of gas exploration costs and higher income tax expense, in large part from a change in the UnitedKingdom corporate income tax rate, partially offset by lower pension costs and interest expense.Natural gas pipelines after-tax earnings increased $106 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase was primarilydue to $73 million of earnings from BHE GT&S, the favorable impact of a rate case settlement at Northern Natural Gas andhigher transportation volume and rates, partially offset by higher depreciation, operating expenses and interest expenses.Other energy business after-tax earnings in 2020 increased $89 million compared to 2019. The increase was primarilydue to increased income tax benefits from renewable wind tax equity investments, largely from projects reaching commercialoperation, partially offset by lower operating revenue and higher operating expenses from geothermal and natural gas units.Real estate brokerage after-tax earnings increased $215 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The increase reflectedhigher earnings from mortgage and brokerage services. The increase in earnings from mortgage services was attributable tohigher refinance activity from the favorable interest rate environment and the earnings increase from brokerage services wasdue to an increase of 13.1% in closed transaction dollar volume.Corporate interest and other after-tax earnings decreased $113 million in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline wasprimarily due to higher interest expense and lower state income tax benefits.\fK-47Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Manufacturing, Service and RetailingA summary of revenues and earnings of our manufacturing, service and retailing businesses follows (dollars inmillions).Percentage change2021202020192021 vs 20202020 vs 2019RevenuesManufacturing$68,730$59,079$62,73016.3%(5.8)%Service and retailing84,28275,01879,94512.3(6.2)$ 153,012$ 134,097$ 142,67514.1(6.0)Pre-tax earningsManufacturing$9,841$8,010$9,52222.9%(15.9)%Service and retailing4,7112,8792,84363.61.314,55210,88912,36533.6(11.9)Income taxes and noncontrolling interests3,4322,5892,993Net earnings*$11,120$8,300$9,372Effective income tax rate23.0%23.3%23.7%Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues9.5%8.1%8.7%*Excludes certain acquisition accounting expenses, which primarily related to the amortization of identified intangibleassets recorded in connection with our business acquisitions.

(“PCC”)), specialty chemicals (The Lubrizol Corporation (“Lubrizol”)), metal cutting tools/systems (IMCInternational Metalworking Companies (“IMC”)), and Marmon, which consists of more than 100 autonomous manufacturingand service businesses, internally aggregated into eleven groups, and includes equipment leasing for the rail, intermodal tankcontainer and mobile crane industries. The industrial products group also includes equipment and systems for the livestockand agricultural industries (CTB International) and a variety of industrial products for diverse markets (Scott Fetzer andLiquidPower Specialty Products).2021 versus 2020Revenues of the industrial products group in 2021 increased $2.5 billion (9.8%) from 2020. Pre-tax earnings increased$714 million (19.0%) compared to 2020 and pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2021 was 15.9%, an increase of1.3 percentage points compared 2020.PCC’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, a decrease of $853 million (11.6%) compared to 2020. Historically, PCChas derived significant revenues and earnings from aerospace products. The COVID-19 pandemic contributed to materialdeclines in commercial air travel and original equipment manufacturing (“OEM”) aircraft production in 2021 and 2020.While commercial air travel increased in both the U.S. and international markets in 2021 versus 2020, demand remains wellbelow pre-pandemic levels, especially for international routes. Long-term industry forecasts continue to show growth andstrong demand for travel, however, the recovery has been uneven between domestic and international markets. Air trafficrecovery will continue to be impacted by the pandemic, though likely more on a seasonal or localized basis as the pandemicshifts to an endemic phase. Near term recovery in build rates will lag recovery in air travel due to the significant finishedgoods inventory following quality issues with the Boeing 737 and Boeing 787 planes and industry supply chain issues.PCC’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 were $1.2 billion, an increase of 78.8% compared to 2020. The increase reflects theactions taken by management to resize, restructure and improve operations and to prepare for more normalized demand forPCC’s products, as well as from a decline in restructuring costs. We do not expect significant increases in PCC’s aerospacerevenues or earnings to occur in the near term, primarily due to the relatively low aircraft build rates related to Boeing’ssignificant inventory levels and the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on commercial air travel.Lubrizol’s revenues were $6.5 billion in 2021, an increase of 8.6% compared to 2020. The increase reflects higheraverage selling prices, driven by significant increases in materials and other manufacturing costs, as well as slightly highervolumes. Sales volumes in the Additives product lines were negatively affected by severe winter storms in February 2021,which caused the temporary shut-down of several U.S. facilities, as well as other temporary production shut-downs in thesecond half of 2021.Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 decreased 50.8% compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 included significant lossesrelated to a fire in June 2021 at a facility of Chemtool Incorporated, a Lubrizol subsidiary, located in Rockton, Illinois andimpairment charges in the second half of 2021 related to an underperforming business in the Advanced Materials productlines. These losses and charges aggregated $257 million in 2021. Earnings in 2021 were also negatively impacted by theeffects of accelerating raw material costs and the previously mentioned temporary shut-down of Additives productionfacilities, which resulted in lost sales and incremental manufacturing costs.Marmon’s revenues were $9.8 billion in 2021, an increase of $2.1 billion (27.9%) compared to 2020. Revenues in 2021from the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups increased 54% over 2020, accounting for over halfof the aggregate increase in Marmon’s revenues. These increases were attributable to higher volumes and prices, includingthe impact of significantly higher average copper and metal prices. Revenues of most of Marmon’s other groups, particularlythose serving the construction, automotive, heavy-duty truck and restaurant markets, also increased in 2021, reflecting highervolumes and favorable foreign currency translation effects. These increases were partially offset by the impact of divestituresand business closures in the Water Technologies and Retail Solutions groups and lower lease revenues in the Rail & Leasinggroup, reflecting fewer railcars on lease and changes in lease mix.Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2021 increased 40.3% compared to 2020. The increase was primarily due to earningsincreases in the Electrical, Metal Services and Plumbing & Refrigeration groups due to higher volumes and average margins.Earnings of several other business groups also increased attributable to higher sales volumes, sales mix changes and lowerrestructuring charges, which were partially offset by lower earnings from the Rail & Leasing and Water Technologies groups.\fK-49Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)Industrial products (Continued)IMC’s revenues increased 19.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, reflecting improving business conditions in mostgeographic regions and favorable foreign currency translation effects. IMC’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.7% in 2021 versus2020, primarily attributable to higher customer demand, improved manufacturing efficiencies, operating cost managementsaving initiatives and favorable foreign currency translation effects.2020 versus 2019Revenues of the industrial products group in 2020 declined $4.9 billion (16.1%) from 2019, while pre-tax earningsdeclined $1.9 billion (33.4%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues for the group was 14.6% in 2020 compared to18.4% in 2019.PCC’s revenues were $7.3 billion in 2020, a decrease of $3.0 billion (28.9%) compared to 2019. The COVID-19pandemic contributed to material declines in commercial air travel and aircraft production. Airlines responded to thepandemic by delaying delivery of aircraft orders or, in some cases, cancelling aircraft orders, resulting in significantreductions in build rates by aircraft manufacturers and significant inventory reduction initiatives by PCC’s customers.Further, Boeing’s 737 MAX aircraft production issues contributed to the declines in aerospace product sales across theindustry in 2020. These factors resulted in significant declines in demand for PCC’s aerospace products in 2020. PCC’s salesof products for power markets increased 2.2% in 2020, primarily driven by increases in industrial gas turbine products, offsetby reductions in oil and gas products.PCC’s pre-tax earnings were $650 million in 2020, a decrease of 64.5% compared to 2019, which reflected the declinein aerospace product sales as well as increased manufacturing inefficiencies attributable to lower volumes. In response to theeffects of the pandemic, PCC took aggressive restructuring actions to resize operations in response to reduced expectedvolumes in aerospace markets. PCC’s worldwide workforce was reduced by about 40% from the end of 2019. PCC recordedrestructuring, inventory and fixed asset charges of approximately $295 million in 2020. Earnings as a percentage of revenueswere negatively impacted in 2020 due to inefficiencies associated with aligning operations to reduced aircraft build rates.Lubrizol’s revenues were $5.95 billion in 2020, a decrease of 8.0% compared to 2019. The decline was primarilyattributable to lower volumes from economic effects of the pandemic and a fire at an Additives manufacturing, blending andstorage facility in Rouen, France at the end of the third quarter of 2019, which resulted in the temporary suspension ofoperations. Revenues in 2020 also reflected lower selling prices, partly offset by favorable changes in sales mix. Lubrizol’sconsolidated volume for the year declined 9% in 2020 compared to 2019 due to declines in the Additives and EngineeredMaterials product lines, partly offset by higher volumes in Life Science products.Lubrizol’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 were approximately $1.0 billion, essentially unchanged compared to 2019. Theeffects of lower sales volumes, including the effects from the Rouen fire, and lower average selling prices were offset bylower average raw material costs, lower operating expenses and insurance recoveries in 2020 associated with the Rouen fire.Marmon’s revenues were $7.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of $681 million (8.2%) compared to 2019. Excluding theeffects of business acquisitions, revenues decreased in essentially all groups, primarily attributable to lower demand from theeffects of the pandemic. The largest effects were experienced in the Transportation Products and Foodservice Technologiesgroups. Additionally, revenues decreased due to lower metal prices in the Metal Services group and the effect of businessdivestitures in 2019. Declines in oil prices in 2020 also adversely affected demand and revenues in the Rail & Leasing andCrane Services groups. Marmon acquired the Colson Medical companies on October 31, 2019, which represents Marmon’sMedical group.Marmon’s pre-tax earnings in 2020 decreased $312 million (24.3%) compared to 2019. The decrease reflected thedeclines in revenues and increased restructuring charges. Restructuring initiatives were initiated in response to the lowerproduct demand, particularly in the sectors most impacted by the pandemic.\fK-50Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)Industrial products (Continued)IMC’s revenues declined 13.2% in 2020 compared to 2019, reflecting negative economic effects from the pandemic ondemand for cutting tools in most geographic regions, partly offset by the effects of business acquisitions. IMC’s pre-taxearnings declined 26.6% in 2020 versus 2019, attributable to declines in sales and margins due to lower volumes and tochanges in sales mix.Building productsThe building products group includes manufactured and site-built home construction and related lending and financialservices (Clayton Homes), flooring (Shaw), insulation, roofing and engineered products (Johns Manville), bricks andmasonry products (Acme Building Brands), paint and coatings (Benjamin Moore) and residential and commercialconstruction and engineering products and systems (MiTek).2021 versus 2020Revenues of the building products group increased $3.7 billion (17.6%) in 2021 and pre-tax earnings increased $532million (18.6%) compared to 2020. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.6% in 2021 and 13.5% in 2020.During 2021, our businesses experienced strong customer demand and higher sales volumes. We also experienced variousforms of supply chain disruptions, which affected the general economy, and contributed to considerable raw material andlogistics cost inflation and supply constraints.Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $10.5 billion in 2021, an increase of $1.9 billion (22.2%) over 2020.Revenues from home sales increased $1.8 billion (26.5%) in 2021 to approximately $8.3 billion, reflecting increased revenueper home sold, changes in sales mix and a net increase in new units sold. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 15.8% in2021, while factory-built manufactured home unit sales increased 1.5%. Site-built home unit sales were constrained by longerconstruction periods arising from supply chain constraints and labor shortages. Financial services revenues, which includemortgage origination and services, insurance and interest income from lending activities, increased 7.8% in 2021 comparedto 2020. Loan balances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $18.8 billion as of December 31, 2021, anincrease of approximately $1.7 billion compared to December 31, 2020.Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of $440 million (35.3%)compared to 2020. Earnings in 2021 reflected higher earnings from home sales, mortgage originations, net interest incomeand lower provisions for expected credit losses, partially offset by the impact of rising manufacturing and supply chain costs.The provision for expected credit losses in 2020 was unusually high and included provisions for the expected impact of theCOVID-19 pandemic. The comparative decline in the provision for expected credit losses was due to fewer actual andanticipated loan foreclosures.Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $14.5 billion in 2021, an increase of14.4% versus 2020. The increase was primarily due to higher average selling prices driven by significantly higher input andsupply chain costs, as well as higher unit volumes for paint and coatings, flooring, insulation, roofing and other engineeredproducts.Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.7 billion in 2021, an increase of 5.7%over 2020. Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues was 11.8% in 2021, a 1.0 percentage point decrease compared to2020. While customer demand in 2021 was generally strong, reduced availability of materials and other product inputs fromsupply chain disruptions negatively affected sales and operating results. In addition, higher costs for raw materials and freightand higher restructuring and impairment charges contributed to the reduction in our pre-tax margin rates.2020 versus 2019Revenues of the building products group increased $917 million (4.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earningsincreased $222 million (8.4%) over 2019. Pre-tax earnings as percentages of revenues were 13.5% in 2020 and 13.0% in2019.\fK-51Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)Building products (Continued)Clayton Homes’ revenues were approximately $8.6 billion in 2020, an increase of $1.3 billion (17.1%) over 2019. Theincrease was primarily due to increases in home sales of $1.0 billion (18.4%), driven by increases in units sold and revenueper home sold and by changes in sales mix. Unit sales of site-built homes increased 28.6% in 2020 over 2019, while revenueper home increased slightly. Manufactured home unit sales increased 2.8% in 2020. Financial services revenues increased13.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, attributable to increased loan originations and average outstanding loan balances. Loanbalances, net of allowances for credit losses, were approximately $17.1 billion at December 31, 2020 compared to$15.9 billion as of December 31, 2019.Pre-tax earnings of Clayton Homes were approximately $1.25 billion in 2020, an increase of $152 million (13.9%)compared to 2019. The earnings increase reflected higher earnings from home sales, partly offset by higher materials costs,which lowered manufactured housing gross margin rates. Earnings in 2020 also benefitted from increased interest income,lower interest expense and higher earnings from mortgage services, partly offset by increased provisions for credit andinsurance losses.Aggregate revenues of our other building products businesses were approximately $12.6 billion in 2020, a decrease of2.6% versus 2019. The revenue decrease reflected lower flooring volumes, in part attributable to the negative effects of theCOVID-19 pandemic, partially offset by increased paint and coatings volumes, including volumes from a new agreementwith Ace Hardware Stores, and increased volumes in residential markets.Pre-tax earnings of the other building products businesses were approximately $1.6 billion in 2020, an increase of 4.6%over 2019. The earnings increase reflected the effects of lower average input costs, operating cost containment efforts andlower facilities closure costs.Consumer productsThe consumer products group includes leisure vehicles (Forest River), several apparel and footwear operations(including Fruit of the Loom, Garan, H.H. Brown Shoe Group and Brooks Sports) and a manufacturer of high-performancealkaline batteries (Duracell). This group also includes custom picture framing products (Larson-Juhl) and jewelry products(Richline).2021 versus 2020Consumer products revenues increased $3.4 billion (28.0%) in 2021 versus 2020. Revenues from Forest Riverincreased 40.2% in 2021 compared to 2020, driven by a 27.6% increase in recreational vehicle unit sales and higher averageselling prices, primarily due to significant increases in manufacturing costs.Revenues of several of our other consumer products businesses were significantly higher in 2021 as compared to 2020.The initial impacts of the pandemic in the first half of 2020 from temporary retail store closures and reduced demand had asevere impact on most of these businesses. Apparel and footwear revenues increased 25.3% in 2021 compared to 2020,reflecting significant increases in unit sales, partly attributable to inventory restocking by certain customers, and fromincreased consumer demand. Revenues from Richline increased 39.9%, while revenues from Duracell increased 2.4%.Consumer products pre-tax earnings increased $585 million (41.9%) in 2021 compared to 2020 and as a percentage ofrevenues in 2021 increased 1.2 percentage points to 12.7%. The increase reflected significant earnings increases at many ofour businesses, driven by Forest River, the apparel and footwear businesses, Richline and Larson-Juhl. However, ourconsumer products businesses, particularly the apparel and footwear businesses, also experienced significant cost increasesand supply chain disruptions, causing pre-tax margins in the second half of 2021 to be 1.1 percentage points lower than in thefirst half of the year.2020 versus 2019Consumer products revenues increased $359 million (3.0%) in 2020 versus 2019, while pre-tax earnings increased$146 million (11.7%). Pre-tax earnings as a percentage of revenues in 2020 increased 0.9 percentage points to 11.5%.\fK-52Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)Consumer products (Continued)The comparative increase in revenues reflected increases from Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lowerapparel and footwear revenues. Forest River revenues increased 11.7% in 2020 compared to 2019, primarily attributable to asignificant increase in recreational vehicle unit sales over the last half of the year and changes in sales mix. Unit sales in thesecond half of 2020 increased 31% over the second half of 2019. Revenues from Duracell increased 10.0% in 2020 comparedto 2019, reflecting the effects of changes in sales mix and increased volume. Apparel and footwear revenues declined 6.1% in2020 compared to 2019.Apparel and footwear sales volumes in the first half of 2020, particularly in the second quarter, reflected the negativeeffects of the pandemic, which included retail store closures, reduced or cancelled orders and pandemic-related disruptions atcertain manufacturing facilities. Sales recovered somewhat in the second half of 2020, attributable to higher consumerdemand and inventory restocking by retailers. Brooks Sports revenues were higher, partly attributable to the effect of thereduced sales in 2019 that were caused by shipping delays at a new distribution facility.Pre-tax earnings were $1.4 billion in 2020, an increase of $146 million (11.7%) compared to 2019. The increase wasprimarily attributable to Forest River and Duracell, partially offset by lower earnings from apparel and footwear.

Revenues from TTI increased 37.4% in 2021 versus 2020, primarilyattributable to significantly higher volumes across all significant markets and product categories, and to a lesser extent,higher average prices and changes in sales mix. Customer demand accelerated throughout 2021, as customers attempted tomaintain adequate inventories in response to high demand for components in end products and effects of supply chaindisruptions. Revenues from aviation services increased 27.5% in 2021 over low 2020 levels, primarily due to higher traininghours (24%) and customer flight hours (70%).Pre-tax earnings of our service business group increased $1.1 billion (67.0%) to $2.7 billion. Pre-tax earnings of thegroup as a percentage of revenues were 16.8% in 2021, an increase of 3.8 percentage points compared to 2020. Earnings atnearly all service businesses increased in 2021 compared to 2020, with the largest increases from TTI, the aviation servicesbusinesses and the XTRA leasing business. TTI’s earnings increase was primarily attributable to the increases in salesvolumes, as well as from improved operating cost leverage and changes in sales mix. The increase in earnings from aviationservices was attributable to the favorable effects of higher volume, changes in business mix, increased operating efficiencies,lower impairment charges and the effects of past restructuring efforts, partly offset by higher subcontractor costs attributableto the significant increase in flight demand.2020 versus 2019Service group revenues declined $1.15 billion (8.5%) in 2020 compared to 2019 and pre-tax earnings decreased $81million (4.8%). Pre-tax earnings of the group as a percentage of revenues were 13.0% in 2020, an increase of 0.5 percentagepoints compared to 2019.The aggregate revenues of NetJets and FlightSafety in 2020 declined $816 million (13.5%) compared to 2019,reflecting lower demand for air travel and aviation services attributable to the COVID-19 pandemic. NetJets experienced adecline in customer flight hours of 27% and FlightSafety’s commercial and corporate simulator training hours declined 30%from 2019. The comparative service group revenue decline also reflected the disposition of the newspaper operations inMarch of 2020 and lower revenues from CORT, which was driven by lower demand attributable to the pandemic. Thesedeclines were partially offset by revenue increases from TTI and WPLG.The decline in earnings reflected lower earnings from NetJets, TTI and CORT and the divestiture of the newspaperoperations, partly offset by higher earnings from XTRA, Business Wire, WPLG and FlightSafety. TTI’s earnings declinereflected lower average gross margin rates, attributable to product mix changes and sales price pressures deriving from ampleinventory availability. The decline at NetJets was primarily attributable to increased asset impairment charges andrestructuring costs, partly offset by lower general and administrative expenses and a slight net increase in margins. Thedecline at CORT was driven by lower revenues, partly offset by the effects of cost control initiatives. The increase atFlightSafety was attributable to the effects of contract losses of approximately $165 million recorded in 2019 with respect toan existing government contract and cost control efforts in 2020, which more than offset significantly lower earnings fromcommercial and corporate training services.RetailingOur largest retailing business is Berkshire Hathaway Automotive, Inc. (“BHA”), representing 62% of our combinedretailing revenue in 2021. BHA consists of over 80 auto dealerships that sell new and pre-owned automobiles and offer repairservices and related products. BHA also operates two insurance businesses, two auto auctions and an automotive fluidmaintenance products distributor. Our retailing businesses also include four home furnishings retailing businesses (NebraskaFurniture Mart, R.C. Willey, Star Furniture and Jordan’s), which sell furniture, appliances, flooring and electronics. Thehome furnishings group represented 21% of the combined retailing revenues in 2021.Other retailing businesses include three jewelry retailing businesses (Borsheims, Helzberg and Ben Bridge), See’sCandies (confectionary products), Pampered Chef (high quality kitchen tools), Oriental Trading Company (party supplies,school supplies and toys and novelties) and Detlev Louis Motorrad (“Louis”), a retailer of motorcycle accessories based inGermany.\fK-54Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)Retailing (Continued)2021 versus 2020Retailing group revenues in 2021 increased $3.1 billion (19.8%) compared to 2020. BHA’s revenues increased 19.0%in 2021 compared to 2020, with vehicle sales, service and repair, and finance and service contract revenues each increasingversus 2020. Revenues from vehicle sales in 2021 increased $1.7 billion (20.7%) versus 2020, primarily due to higheraverage selling prices, as well as a 2.7% increase in units sold. However, new vehicle unit sales in the second half of 2021declined 18% compared to the second half of 2020, reflecting significant new vehicle supply shortages at OEMs attributableto the global computer chip shortages and other supply chain disruptions. Home furnishings group revenues increased 22.0%in 2021 as compared to 2020, attributable to higher consumer demand and higher average selling prices, driven by higherinventory and freight costs.Pre-tax earnings in 2021 of the retailing group increased $781 million (76.0%) from 2020 and the pre-tax margin rateincreased 3.0 percentage points to 9.5%. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased 47.5% in 2021 compared to 2020, primarily dueto increased vehicle sales margins and higher earnings from finance and service contract activities. In addition, earnings in2021 benefitted from lower floorplan interest expense, attributable to significant declines in inventory levels, and fromongoing operating cost control efforts.Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased 67.6% in 2021 versus 2020, reflecting generally higher averagegross margin rates and sales mix changes and cost control efforts, partly offset by higher personnel costs. Aggregate pre-taxearnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased $321 million in 2021 compared to 2020. The initial effects of thepandemic in 2020 were severe for most of our other retailers due to the restricted operations at many of those businesses.Results in 2021 also benefitted from relatively strong consumer demand and the effects of restructuring efforts in 2020.2020 versus 2019Retailing group revenues in 2020 declined $159 million (1.0%) compared to 2019. The spread of COVID-19 resultedin the temporary closures or restricted operations at several of our retailing businesses and effected consumer spendingpatterns during 2020. The severity and duration of the effects from the pandemic varied widely at our retail operations.BHA’s revenues decreased 2.9% in 2020 compared to 2019. BHA’s revenues in 2020 reflected decreases in new andpre-owned vehicle sales of 2.6%, as well as lower vehicle service and repair revenues. Home furnishings revenues wereessentially unchanged in 2020 compared to 2019. The retailing group experienced lower revenues in the first half of 2020,attributable to restricted store hours, which were substantially offset by increased revenues over the second half of the year.However, supply chain disruptions had a negative effect on obtaining product at certain times, which negatively affectedsales levels.The effects of the pandemic contributed to significantly lower sales in 2020 for our jewelry stores, See’s Candies andOriental Trading Company, which were more than offset by significant revenue increases from Pampered Chef and Louis.Sales volumes generally increased and operating results improved beginning in the latter part of the second quarter as ouroperations slowly reopened.Retail group pre-tax earnings increased $154 million (17.6%) in 2020 from 2019. BHA’s pre-tax earnings increased37.7%, primarily due to lower selling, general and administrative expenses, lower floorplan interest expense and higheraverage gross sales margin rates. Aggregate pre-tax earnings for the remainder of our retailing group increased 1.1% in 2020compared to 2019, reflecting higher earnings from the home furnishings businesses and from Pampered Chef, which weresubstantially offset by lower earnings from our other retailing operations.Home furnishings group pre-tax earnings increased $79 million (36%) in 2020 versus 2019, reflecting generally higheraverage gross margin rates, sales mix changes and fewer sales promotions and lower advertising and other operatingexpenses. Certain of our other operations, including Pampered Chef and Louis experienced significant earnings increases in2020, while others, including See’s Candies and Oriental Trading Company, experienced significant declines driven by thenegative effects of the pandemic.\fK-55Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Manufacturing, Service and Retailing (Continued)Retailing (Continued)McLaneMcLane Company, Inc. (“McLane”) operates a wholesale distribution business that provides grocery and non-foodconsumer products to retailers and convenience stores (“grocery”) and to restaurants (“foodservice”). McLane also operatesbusinesses that are wholesale distributors of distilled spirits, wine and beer (“beverage”). The grocery and foodservicebusinesses generate high sales and very low profit margins. These businesses have several significant customers, includingWalmart, 7-Eleven, Yum! Brands and others. Grocery sales comprised about 63% of McLane’s consolidated sales in 2021with food service comprising most of the remainder. A curtailment of purchasing by any of its significant customers couldhave an adverse impact on periodic revenues and earnings.2021 versus 2020Revenues increased $2.6 billion (5.6%) in 2021 compared to 2020. Revenues from the grocery business increased 1.5%compared to 2020, while revenues from the foodservice and beverage businesses increased 13.1% and 17.8%, respectively.The foodservice business was significantly impacted by pandemic-related restaurant closures in 2020.Pre-tax earnings decreased $21 million (8.4%) in 2021 as compared to 2020. The decrease reflected significantincreases in personnel, contract transportation and fuel costs, which more than offset the favorable impact of higher sales andslightly higher gross sales margins. McLane’s grocery and food service operations were significantly affected in 2021 byupstream supply chain constraints, including the effects of labor and truck driver shortages, which contributed to higherinventory costs reflected in a LIFO inventory reserve increase of $130 million, and disruptions in inventory availability.These upstream supply chain effects, together with the truck driver and warehouse personnel shortages that we areexperiencing, adversely affected our customer service levels and reduced our operating efficiencies. In response, our hiringand wage and benefits costs increased significantly in 2021. The increase in fuel expense was primarily attributable tosignificant increases in petroleum prices. We expect the current difficult operating environment to continue through 2022.2020 versus 2019Revenues declined $3.6 billion (7.2%) in 2020 compared to 2019. The decline was attributable to COVID-19-relatedrestaurant closures (particularly in the casual dining category) in the foodservice business and lower sales in certain productcategories within the grocery business. McLane operates on a 52/53-week fiscal year and 2020 included 52 weeks comparedto 53 weeks in 2019. Otherwise, revenues declined 5.2% in the grocery business and 7.7% in the foodservice business in2020 as compared to 2019.Pre-tax earnings decreased $37 million (12.8%) in 2020 as compared to 2019. The earnings decrease included theeffects of increased LIFO inventory reserves of $22 million, credit and inventory losses of $12 million in the foodserviceoperations and the impact of lower sales.Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/LossesA summary of investment and derivative contract gains/losses follows (dollars in millions).202120202019Investment gains/losses$77,576$40,905$71,123Derivative contract gains/losses966(159)1,484Gains/losses before income taxes and noncontrolling interests78,54240,74672,607Income taxes and noncontrolling interests16,2029,15515,162Net earnings$62,340$31,591$57,445Effective income tax rate20.4%21.7%20.9%\fK-56Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Investment and Derivative Contract Gains/Losses (Continued)Investment gains/lossesUnrealized gains and losses arising from changes in market prices of our investments in equity securities are includedin our reported earnings, which significantly increases the volatility of our periodic net earnings due to the magnitude of ourequity securities portfolio and the inherent volatility of equity securities prices. Pre-tax investment gains/losses included netunrealized gains of approximately $76.4 billion in 2021, $55.0 billion in 2020 and $69.6 billion in 2019 attributable tochanges in market prices of equity securities we held at the end of each year. In each year, we also recorded pre-tax gains andlosses from market value changes during each year on equity securities sold during such year, including gains of $1.0 billionin 2021, losses of $14.0 billion in 2020 and gains of $1.6 billion in 2019. Taxable investment gains on equity securities sold,which is generally the difference between sales proceeds and the original cost basis of the securities sold, were $3.6 billion in2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2 billion in 2019.We believe that investment gains/losses, whether realized from sales or unrealized from changes in market prices, areoften meaningless in terms of understanding our periodic consolidated earnings or evaluating our periodic economicperformance. We continue to believe the investment gains/losses recorded in earnings, including the changes in market pricesfor equity securities, in any given period has little analytical or predictive value.Derivative contract gains/lossesDerivative contract gains/losses include the changes in fair value of our equity index put option contract liabilities,which relate to contracts that were originated prior to March 2008. A vast majority of these contracts have since expired.Contracts comprising 63% of the remaining notional value as of December 31, 2021 will expire in the first quarter of 2022.The periodic changes in the fair values of these liabilities are recorded in earnings and, historically, were significant,primarily due to the volatility of underlying equity markets. As of December 31, 2021, the intrinsic value of our equity indexput option contracts was near zero and our recorded liability at fair value was approximately $99 million. Our ultimatepayment obligations, if any, under our contracts will be determined as of the contract expiration dates based on the intrinsicvalue as defined under the contracts. The pre-tax gains and losses in each of the past three years reflected changes in theequity index values and shorter remaining contract durations. Settlement payments to counterparties over the past three yearswere insignificant.OtherA summary of after-tax other earnings/losses follows (in millions).202120202019Equity method earnings$881$665$1,023Acquisition accounting expenses(690)(783)(788)Goodwill and intangible asset impairments—(10,381)(96)Corporate interest expense, before foreign currency effects(305)(334)(280)Foreign currency exchange rate gains (losses) on Berkshireand BHFC non-U.S. Dollar senior notes955(764)58Other Berkshire corporate474279507$1,315$(11,318)$424After-tax equity method earnings include our proportionate share of earnings attributable to our investments in KraftHeinz, Pilot, Berkadia, Electric Transmission of Texas and Iroquois Gas Transmission Systems.

Such charges arise primarily from the amortization orimpairment of intangible assets recorded in connection with those business acquisitions. Goodwill and intangible assetimpairments in 2020 included after-tax charges of $9.8 billion attributable to impairments of goodwill and certain identifiableintangible assets that were recorded in connection with our acquisition of PCC in 2016. See Other Critical AccountingPolicies on page K-62 for additional details.Foreign currency exchange rate gains and losses pertain to Berkshire’s Euro and Japanese Yen denominated debt andBHFC’s Great Britain Pound denominated debt. Changes in foreign currency exchange rates produce unrealized gains andlosses from the periodic revaluation of these liabilities into U.S. Dollars. The gains and losses recorded in any given periodcan be significant due to the magnitude of the borrowings and the inherent volatility in foreign currency exchange rates.Berkshire corporate items consist primarily of Berkshire parent company investment income and corporate expenses, otherintercompany interest income where the interest expense is included in earnings of the operating businesses and unallocatedincome taxes.Financial ConditionOur consolidated balance sheet continues to reflect very significant liquidity and a very strong capital base.Consolidated shareholders’ equity at December 31, 2021 was $506.2 billion, an increase of $63.0 billion since December 31,2020. Net earnings attributable to Berkshire shareholders was $89.8 billion and included after-tax gains on our investments ofapproximately $61.6 billion. Over each of the last three years, investment gains and losses from changes in the market pricesof our investments in equity securities produced exceptional volatility in our periodic earnings.Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase its Class A and Class Bshares at prices below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, as conservatively determined by Warren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman ofthe Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of the Board. The program does not specify amaximum number of shares to be repurchased and does not require any specified repurchase amount. The program isexpected to continue indefinitely. We will not repurchase our stock if it reduces the total amount of Berkshire’s consolidatedcash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. Financial strength and redundant liquidity willalways be of paramount importance at Berkshire. Berkshire paid $27.1 billion in 2021 to repurchase shares of its Class A andB common stock.At December 31, 2021, our insurance and other businesses held cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bills of$143.9 billion, which included $119.6 billion in U.S. Treasury Bills. Investments in equity and fixed maturity securities(excluding our investment in Kraft Heinz) were $367.2 billion. Our fixed maturity securities at December 31, 2021 includedapproximately $14.4 billion of investments that mature in 2022 and 2023.Our consolidated borrowings at December 31, 2021 were $114.3 billion, of which over 95% were by the Berkshireparent company, BHFC, BNSF and BHE and its subsidiaries. Expected principal and interest payments related to ourconsolidated borrowings in each of the next five years are (in billions): $10.2 in 2022; $14.6 in 2023; $9.7 in 2024; $9.9 in2025; and $8.7 in 2026.Berkshire parent company debt outstanding at December 31, 2021 was $21.4 billion, a decrease of $1.3 billion sinceDecember 31, 2020, which was primarily due to the effects of foreign currency exchange rate changes on Euro and JapaneseYen denominated debt. In 2021, Berkshire repaid Euro and U.S. Dollar denominated debt aggregating approximately $2.2billion of maturing senior notes and issued Euro and Yen denominated senior notes aggregating approximately $2.2 billionwith maturity dates ranging from 2026 to 2041 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%. In January 2022, Berkshirerepaid $600 million of maturing senior notes and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes withmaturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%.Berkshire’s insurance and other subsidiary outstanding borrowings were approximately $17.9 billion at December 31,2021, which included senior note borrowings of BHFC, a wholly-owned financing subsidiary, of approximately $13.1 billion.BHFC’s borrowings are used to fund a portion of loans originated and acquired by Clayton Homes and equipment held forlease by our railcar leasing business. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of2.5% senior notes due in 2051. Berkshire guarantees BHFC’s senior notes for the full and timely payment of principal andinterest.\fK-58Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Financial Condition (Continued)BNSF’s outstanding debt was $23.2 billion as of December 31, 2021, relatively unchanged from December 31, 2020.During 2021, BNSF repaid $1.54 billion of debt and issued $1.55 billion of debentures with a weighted average interest rateof 3.1% with maturity dates in 2051 and 2052. Outstanding borrowings of BHE and its subsidiaries were $51.8 billion atDecember 31, 2021, a decrease of $382 million since December 31, 2020. In 2021, BHE and its subsidiaries issued new termdebt of approximately $2.2 billion with maturity dates ranging from 2028 to 2052 and repaid term debt of approximately$2.5 billion. Berkshire does not guarantee the repayment of debt issued by BNSF, BHE or any of their subsidiaries.In each of the past three years, our diverse group of businesses generated net operating cash flows of approximately$39 billion. Our consolidated capital expenditures for property, plant and equipment and equipment held for lease were $13.3billion in 2021, which included capital expenditures by our railroad, utilities and energy businesses (BNSF and BHE) of $9.5billion. BNSF and BHE maintain very large investments in capital assets (property, plant and equipment) and will regularlymake significant capital expenditures in the normal course of business. We forecast capital expenditures of these twooperations will approximate $11.1 billion in 2022.Contractual ObligationsWe are party to other contracts associated with ongoing business activities, which will result in cash payments tocounterparties in future periods. Certain obligations are included in our Consolidated Balance Sheets, such as operating leaseliabilities and shared aircraft repurchase liabilities of NetJets. Estimated payments of these liabilities in each of the next fiveyears are (in billions): $1.6 in 2022; $1.5 in 2023; $1.4 in 2024; $1.2 in 2025; and $1.2 in 2026.We are also obligated to pay claims arising from property and casualty insurance companies. Such liabilities, includingamounts from retroactive reinsurance, were approximately $125 billion at December 31, 2021. We currently forecast claimpayments in 2022 of approximately $29 billion with respect to claims occurring prior to 2022. Additionally, we estimate netpayments of approximately $3 billion in 2022 for life, health and annuity benefits under contracts. However, the timing andamount of the payments under insurance and reinsurance contracts are contingent upon the outcome of future events. Actualpayments will likely vary, perhaps materially, from the forecasted payments, as well as from the liabilities currently recordedin our Consolidated Balance Sheet. We anticipate that these payments will be funded by operating cash flows.Other obligations pertaining to the acquisition of goods or services in the future, such as certain purchase obligations,are not currently reflected in the Consolidated Financial Statements and will be recognized in future periods as the goods aredelivered or services are provided. As of December 31, 2021, the largest categories of our long-term contractual obligationsprimarily related to fuel, capacity, transmission and maintenance contracts and capital expenditure commitments of BHE andBNSF and aircraft purchase commitments of NetJets. We estimate future payments associated with these contracts over thenext five years of approximately $19 billion, including $8 billion in 2022. We also have an agreement to acquire anadditional 41.4% of Pilot in 2023 and agreements to acquire certain non-controlling interests of consolidated subsidiaries.Reference is made to Note 26 to the Consolidated Financial Statements for additional information regarding thesecommitments.Critical Accounting PoliciesCertain accounting policies require us to make estimates and judgments in determining the amounts reflected in ourConsolidated Financial Statements. Such estimates and judgments necessarily involve varying and possibly significantdegrees of uncertainty. Accordingly, certain amounts currently recorded in our Consolidated Financial Statements will likelybe adjusted in the future based on new available information and changes in other facts and circumstances. A discussion ofour principal accounting policies that required the application of significant judgments as of December 31, 2021 follows.Property and casualty insurance unpaid lossesWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “gross unpaid losses” or “claimliabilities”) based upon estimates of the ultimate amounts payable for loss events occurring on or before the balance sheetdate. The timing and amount of ultimate loss payments are contingent upon, among other things, the timing of claimreporting from insureds and ceding companies and the final determination of the loss amount through the loss adjustment andsettlement process. We use a variety of techniques in establishing claim liabilities, which may require significant judgmentsand assumptions.As of the balance sheet date, recorded claim liabilities include estimates for reported claims and for claims not yetreported. The period between the loss occurrence date and loss settlement date is the “claim-tail.” Property claims usuallyhave relatively short claim-tails, absent litigation. Casualty claims usually have longer claim-tails, occasionally extending fordecades. Casualty claims may be more susceptible to litigation and the impact of changing contract interpretations. The legalenvironment and judicial process further contribute to extending claim-tails.\fK-59Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Property and casualty losses (Continued)Our consolidated claim liabilities, including liabilities from retroactive reinsurance contracts, as of December 31, 2021were approximately $125 billion, of which 80% related to GEICO and the Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.Additional information regarding significant uncertainties inherent in the processes and techniques for estimating unpaidlosses of these businesses follows.GEICOGEICO predominantly writes private passenger auto insurance. As of December 31, 2021, GEICO’s gross unpaidlosses were $23.9 billion and claim liabilities, net of reinsurance recoverable, were $22.7 billion. GEICO’s claim reservingmethodologies produce liability estimates based upon the individual claims. The key assumptions affecting our liabilityestimates include projections of ultimate claim counts (“frequency”) and average loss per claim (“severity”). We utilize acombination of several actuarial estimation methods, including Bornhuetter-Ferguson and chain-ladder methodologies.Claim liability estimates for automobile liability coverages (such as bodily injury (“BI”), uninsured motorists, andpersonal injury protection) are more uncertain due to the longer claim-tails, so we establish additional case developmentestimates. As of December 31, 2021, case development liabilities averaged approximately 34% of the case reserves. Weselect case development factors through analysis of the overall adequacy of historical case liabilities.Incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claim liabilities are based on projections of the ultimate number of claimsexpected (reported and unreported) for each significant coverage. We use historical claim count data to develop age-to-ageprojections of the ultimate counts by quarterly accident period, from which we deduct reported claims to produce the numberof unreported claims. We estimate the average costs per unreported claim and apply such estimates to the unreported claimcounts, producing an IBNR liability estimate. We may record additional IBNR estimates when actuarial techniques aredifficult to apply.We test the adequacy of the aggregate claim liabilities using one or more actuarial projections based on claim closuremodels and paid and incurred loss triangles. Each type of projection analyzes loss occurrence data for claims occurring in agiven period and projects the ultimate cost.Our claim liability estimates recorded at the end of 2020 were reduced by $1.8 billion during 2021, which produced acorresponding increase to pre-tax earnings. The assumptions used to estimate liabilities at December 31, 2021 reflect themost recent frequency and severity estimates. Future development of recorded liabilities will depend on whether actualfrequency and severity of claims are more or less than anticipated.With respect to liabilities for BI claims, we believe it is reasonably possible that average claims severities will changeby at least one percentage point from the projected severities used in establishing the recorded liabilities at December 31,2021. We estimate that a one percentage point increase or decrease in BI severities would produce a $290 million increase ordecrease in recorded liabilities, with a corresponding decrease or increase in pre-tax earnings. Many of the economic forcesthat would likely cause BI severity to differ from expectations would likely also cause severities for other injury coverages todiffer in the same direction.Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance GroupBHRG’s liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses derive primarily from reinsurance contracts issuedthrough NICO and General Re. A summary of BHRG’s property and casualty unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses,other than retroactive reinsurance losses and loss adjustment expenses, as of December 31, 2021 follows (in millions).PropertyCasualtyTotalReported case liabilities$6,602$9,630$16,232IBNR liabilities6,78015,22722,007Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses13,38224,85738,239Reinsurance recoverable1818921,073Net unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses$13,201$23,965$37,166\fK-60Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Property and casualty losses (Continued)Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Gross unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses consist primarily of traditional property and casualty coverageswritten primarily under excess-of-loss and quota-share treaties. Under certain contracts, coverage can apply to multiple linesof business written and the ceding company may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances,we allocate losses to property and casualty coverages based on internal estimates.In connection with reinsurance contracts, the nature, extent, timing and perceived reliability of loss informationreceived from ceding companies varies widely depending on the type of coverage and the contractual reporting terms.Reinsurance contract terms, conditions and coverages also tend to lack standardization and may evolve more rapidly thanprimary insurance policies.The nature and extent of loss information provided under many facultative (individual risk) or per occurrence excesscontracts may be comparable to the information received under a primary insurance contract. However, loss information withrespect to aggregate excess-of-loss and quota-share contracts is often in a summary format rather than on an individual claimbasis. Loss data includes recoverable paid losses, as well as case loss estimates. Ceding companies infrequently providereliable IBNR loss estimates.Loss reporting to reinsurers is typically slower in comparison to primary insurers. In the U.S., such reporting isgenerally required at quarterly intervals ranging from 30 to 90 days after the end of the quarterly period, while outside of theU.S., reinsurance reporting practices may vary further. In certain countries, clients report annually from 90 to 180 days afterthe end of the annual period. To the extent that reinsurers assume and cede underlying risks from other reinsurers, furtherdelays in claims reporting may occur. The relative impact of reporting delays on the reinsurer may vary depending on thetype of coverage, contractual reporting terms, the magnitude of the claim relative to the attachment point of the reinsurancecoverage, and for other reasons.As reinsurers, the premium and loss data we receive is at least one level removed from the underlying claimant, sothere is a risk that the loss data reported is incomplete, inaccurate or the claim is outside the coverage terms. We maintaincertain internal procedures to determine that the information is complete and in compliance with the contract terms.Generally, our reinsurance contracts permit us to access the ceding company’s records with respect to the subject business,thus providing the ability to audit the reported information. In the normal course of business, disputes occasionally ariseconcerning whether claims are covered by our reinsurance policies. We resolve most coverage disputes through negotiationwith the client. If disputes cannot be resolved, our contracts generally provide arbitration or alternative dispute resolutionprocesses. There are no coverage disputes at this time for which an adverse resolution would likely have a material impact onour consolidated results of operations or financial condition.Establishing claim liability estimates for reinsurance assumed requires evaluation of loss information received from ourclients. We generally rely on the ceding companies’ reported case loss estimates. We independently evaluate certain reportedcase losses and if appropriate, we use our own case liability estimate. For instance, as of December 31, 2021, our case lossestimates exceeded ceding company estimates by approximately $700 million for certain legacy workers’ compensationclaims occurring over 10 years ago. We also periodically conduct detailed reviews of individual client claims, which maycause us to adjust our case estimates.Although liabilities for losses are initially determined based on pricing and underwriting analysis, we use a variety ofactuarial methodologies that place reliance on the extrapolation of actual historical data, loss development patterns, industrydata and other benchmarks, as appropriate. The estimate of the IBNR liabilities also requires judgment by actuaries andmanagement to reflect the impact of additional factors like change in business mix, volume, claim reporting and handlingpractices, inflation, social and legal environment and the terms and conditions of the contracts. The methodologies generallyfall into one of the following categories or are hybrids of one or more of the following categories:\fK-61Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Property and casualty losses (Continued)Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group (Continued)Paid and incurred loss development methods – these methods consider expected case loss emergence and developmentpatterns, together with expected loss ratios by year. Factors affecting our loss development analysis include, but are notlimited to, changes in the following: client claims reporting and settlement practices; the frequency of client company claimreviews; policy terms and coverage (such as loss retention levels and occurrence and aggregate policy limits); loss trends; andlegal trends that result in unanticipated losses. Collectively, these factors influence our selections of expected case lossemergence patterns.Incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods – these methods consider actual paid and incurred losses andexpected patterns of paid and incurred losses, taking the initial expected ultimate losses into account to determine an estimateof the expected unpaid or unreported losses.Frequency and severity methods – these methods commonly focus on a review of the number of anticipated claims andthe anticipated claims severity and may also rely on development patterns to derive such estimates. However, our processesand techniques for estimating liabilities in such analyses generally rely more on a per-policy assessment of the ultimate costassociated with the individual loss rather than with an analysis of historical development patterns of past losses.Additional analysis – in some cases we have established reinsurance claim liabilities on a contract-by-contract basis,determined from case loss estimates reported by the ceding company and IBNR liabilities that are primarily a function of ananticipated loss ratio for the contract and the reported case loss estimate. Liabilities are adjusted upward or downward overtime to reflect case losses reported versus expected case losses, which we use to form revised judgement on the adequacy ofthe expected loss ratio and the level of IBNR liabilities required for unreported claims. Anticipated loss ratios are also revisedto include estimates of known major catastrophe events.Our claim liability estimation process for short-tail lines, primarily property exposures, utilizes a combination of thepaid and incurred loss development methods and the incurred and paid loss Bornhuetter-Ferguson methods. Certaincatastrophe, individual risk and aviation excess-of-loss contracts tend to generate low frequency/high severity losses. Ourprocesses and techniques for estimating liabilities under such contracts generally rely more on a per contract assessment ofthe ultimate cost associated with the individual loss event rather than with an analysis of the historical development patternsof past losses.For our long-tail lines, primarily casualty exposures, we may rely on different methods depending on the maturity ofthe business, with estimates for the most recent years being based on priced loss expectations and more mature yearsreflecting the paid or incurred development pattern indications.In 2021, certain workers’ compensation claims reported losses were less than expected. As a result, we reducedestimated ultimate losses for prior years’ loss events by $136 million. We estimate that increases of ten percent in the tail ofthe expected loss emergence pattern and in the expected loss ratios would produce a net increase of approximately $1.0billion in IBNR liabilities, producing a corresponding decrease in pre-tax earnings. We believe it is reasonably possible forthese assumptions to increase at these rates.For other casualty losses, excluding asbestos, environmental, and other latent injury claims, we reduced estimatedultimate liabilities for prior years’ events by approximately $375 million in 2021. For certain significant casualty and generalliability portfolios, we estimate that increases of five percent in the claim-tails of the expected loss emergence patterns and inthe expected loss ratios would produce a net increase in our nominal IBNR liabilities and a corresponding reduction in pre-tax earnings of approximately $950 million, although outcomes of greater than or less than $950 million are possible giventhe diversification in worldwide business.The change in estimated ultimate liabilities for asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims, excludingamounts assumed under retroactive reinsurance contracts was not significant in 2021. Net liabilities for such claims wereapproximately $2.1 billion at December 31, 2021. Loss estimations for these exposures are difficult to determine due to thechanging legal environment and increases may be required in the future if new exposures or claimants are identified, newclaims are reported or new theories of liability emerge.\fK-62Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Property and casualty losses (Continued)Retroactive reinsuranceOur retroactive reinsurance contracts cover loss events occurring before the contract inception dates. Claim liabilitiesassociated with our retroactive reinsurance contracts predominately pertain to casualty or liability exposures. We expect theclaim-tails to be very long. As of December 31, 2021, gross unpaid losses were $38.3 billion and deferred charges were $10.6billion.Our contracts are generally subject to maximum limits of indemnifications and, as such, we currently expect thatmaximum remaining gross losses payable under our retroactive policies will not exceed $54 billion. Absent significantjudicial or legislative changes affecting asbestos, environmental or latent injury exposures, we also currently believe itunlikely that losses will develop upward to the maximum losses payable or downward by more than 15% of our estimatedgross liability.We establish liability estimates by individual contract, considering exposure and development trends. In establishingour liability estimates, we often analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns and project expected ultimate losses undervarious scenarios. We assign judgmental probability factors to these scenarios and an expected outcome is determined. Wethen monitor subsequent loss payment activity and review ceding company reports and other available informationconcerning the underlying losses. We re-estimate the expected ultimate losses when significant events or significantdeviations from expected results are revealed.Certain of our retroactive reinsurance contracts include asbestos, environmental and other latent injury claims. Ourestimated liabilities for such claims were approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021. We do not consistently receivereliable detailed data regarding asbestos, environmental and latent injury claims from all ceding companies, particularly withrespect to multi-line or aggregate excess-of-loss policies. When possible, we conduct a detailed analysis of the underlyingloss data to make an estimate of ultimate reinsured losses. When detailed loss information is unavailable, we developestimates by applying recent industry trends and projections to aggregate client data. Judgments in these areas necessarilyconsider the stability of the legal and regulatory environment under which we expect claims will be adjudicated. Legal reformand legislation could also have a significant impact on our ultimate liabilities.We reduced estimated ultimate liabilities for prior years’ retroactive reinsurance contracts by $974 million in 2021,which after the changes in related deferred charges, resulted in pre-tax earnings of $142 million. In 2021, we paid losses andloss adjustment expenses of $1.9 billion with respect to our retroactive reinsurance contracts.In connection with our retroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charges, which at contract inceptionrepresents the excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate liability for unpaid losses over premiums received. We amortizedeferred charges, which produces charges to pre-tax earnings in future periods based on the expected timing and amount ofloss payments. We also adjust deferred charge balances due to changes in the expected timing and ultimate amount of claimpayments and the effects of the adjustments are included in pre-tax earnings. Significant changes in such estimates may havea significant effect on unamortized deferred charge balances. Based on the contracts in effect as of December 31, 2021, weestimate that amortization expense in 2022 will approximate $950 million.Other Critical Accounting PoliciesOur Consolidated Balance Sheet at December 31, 2021 includes goodwill of acquired businesses of $73.9 billion andother indefinite-lived intangible assets of $18.5 billion. We evaluate these assets for impairment annually in the fourth quarterand on an interim basis if the facts and circumstances lead us to believe that more-likely-not there has been an impairment.Goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment reviews include determining the estimated fair values of ourreporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets. The key assumptions and inputs used in such determinations mayinclude forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capital expenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate andother inputs. Significant judgment by management is required in estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and inperforming impairment reviews. Due to the inherent subjectivity and uncertainty in forecasting future cash flows andearnings over long periods of time, actual results may differ materially from the forecasts. If the carrying value of theindefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairment loss. If the carryingvalue of a reporting unit exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit, then the excess, limited to the carrying amountof goodwill, will be charged to earnings as an impairment loss.\fK-63Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Other Critical Accounting Policies (Continued)As of December 31, 2021, we concluded it is more likely than not that goodwill recorded in our Consolidated BalanceSheet was not impaired. The fair value estimates of reporting units are and will likely be significantly affected byassumptions on the severity, duration or long-term effects of the pandemic on the reporting unit’s business, as well as otherassumptions concerning the long-term economic performance of the reporting unit, which we cannot reliably predict.Consequently, any fair value estimates in such instances can be subject to wide variations.We primarily use discounted projected future earnings or cash flow methods in determining fair values. The keyassumptions and inputs used in such methods may include forecasting revenues and expenses, cash flows and capitalexpenditures, as well as an appropriate discount rate and other inputs. A significant amount of judgment is required inestimating the fair value of a reporting unit and in performing goodwill impairment tests.In connection with the annual goodwill impairment review conducted in the fourth quarter of 2021, the estimated fairvalues of five reporting units did not exceed our carrying values by at least 20%. The most significant of these reporting unitswas Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”). The estimated fair value of PCC was approximately $34.5 billion, exceeding ourcarrying value of approximately $31.1 billion by 10.7%. Our carrying value of PCC included goodwill of approximately $7.5billion. For the four other reporting units, our aggregate estimated fair value was approximately $2.5 billion, which exceededour aggregate carrying value of approximately $2.3 billion by 9.2%. Our carrying value of these units included goodwill ofapproximately $1.2 billion.In the second quarter of 2020, we quantitively reevaluated goodwill for impairment for certain reporting units, andmost significantly for PCC. As a result of our reviews, we recorded pre-tax goodwill impairment charges of $10.0 billion andindefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million, of which approximately $10 billion related to PCC.Prior to the reevaluation, the carrying value of PCC-related goodwill was approximately $17 billion. Additionally, thecarrying value of PCC-related indefinite-lived intangible assets was approximately $14 billion. Substantially all of theseamounts were recorded in connection with Berkshire’s acquisition of PCC in 2016. The initial effects of the COVID-19pandemic on commercial airlines and aircraft manufacturers were particularly severe. At that time, we considered severalfactors in our reevaluation, including but not limited to the announcements by airlines concerning potential future demand,employment levels and aircraft orders, announcements by manufacturers of reduced aircraft production, and the actions wewere taking or may be taking in the future to restructure operations. Consequently, we deemed it prudent under the prevailingcircumstances to increase discount rates and reduce prior long-term forecasts of future cash flows for purposes of reviewingfor impairments.Market Risk DisclosuresOur Consolidated Balance Sheets include substantial amounts of assets and liabilities whose fair values are subject tomarket risks. Our significant market risks are primarily associated with equity prices, interest rates, foreign currencyexchange rates and commodity prices. The fair values of our investment portfolios remain subject to considerable volatility.The following sections address the significant market risks associated with our business activities.Equity Price RiskEquity securities represent a significant portion of our consolidated investment portfolio. Strategically, we strive toinvest in businesses that possess excellent economics and able and honest management, and we prefer to invest a meaningfulamount in each company. Historically, equity investments have been concentrated in relatively few issuers. At December 31,2021, approximately 73% of the total fair value of equity securities was concentrated in four companies.We often hold our equity securities for long periods and short-term price volatility has occurred in the past and willoccur in the future. We also strive to maintain significant levels of shareholder capital and ample liquidity to provide amargin of safety against short-term price volatility.\fK-64Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Equity Price Risk (Continued)We are also subject to equity price risk with respect to our equity index put option contracts, although our equity priceexposure has declined significantly as a vast majority of the contracts written to date have expired. Our ultimate liability withrespect to these contracts is determined from the movement of the underlying stock index between the contract inception dateand expiration date. The fair values of our liabilities arising from these contracts are also affected by changes in other factors.The following table summarizes our equity securities and equity index put option contract liabilities as ofDecember 31, 2021 and 2020 and the estimated effects of a hypothetical 30% increase and a 30% decrease in market pricesas of those dates. The selected 30% hypothetical increase and decrease does not reflect the best or worst case scenario.Indeed, results from declines could be far worse due both to the nature of equity markets and the aforementionedconcentrations existing in our equity investment portfolio.

Our strategy is to acquire or originatesuch instruments at prices considered appropriate relative to the perceived credit risk. We also issue debt in the ordinarycourse of business to fund business operations, business acquisitions and for other general purposes. We attempt to maintainhigh credit ratings, in order to minimize the cost of our debt. We infrequently utilize derivative products, such as interest rateswaps, to manage interest rate risks and we do not attempt to match maturities of assets and liabilities.The fair values of our fixed maturity investments, loans and finance receivables, and notes payable and otherborrowings will fluctuate in response to changes in market interest rates. Interest rate risks associated with the valuations ofour equity index put option contract liabilities are no longer considered significant due to the short duration of remainingexposures as of December 31, 2021. Increases and decreases in interest rates generally translate into decreases and increasesin fair values of these instruments. Additionally, fair values of interest rate sensitive instruments may be affected by thecreditworthiness of the issuer, prepayment options, relative values of alternative investments, the liquidity of the instrumentand other general market conditions.\fK-65Management’s Discussion and Analysis (Continued)Interest Rate Risk (Continued)The following table summarizes the estimated effects of hypothetical changes in interest rates on our significant assetsand liabilities that are subject to significant interest rate risk at December 31, 2021 and 2020. We assumed that the interestrate changes occur immediately and uniformly to each category of instrument and that there were no significant changes toother factors used to determine the value of the instrument. The hypothetical changes in interest rates do not reflect the bestor worst case scenarios. Actual results may differ from those reflected in the table.

As such, we are subject toprice risks related to various commodities. In most instances, we attempt to manage these risks through the pricing of ourproducts and services to customers. To the extent that we are unable to sustain price increases in response to commodity priceincreases, our operating results will likely be adversely affected. We do not utilize derivative contracts to manage commodityprice risks to any significant degree.Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market RiskSee “Market Risk Disclosures” contained in Item 7 “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Conditionand Results of Operations.”Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial ReportingManagement of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control overfinancial reporting, as such term is defined in the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 Rule 13a-15(f).

We also have audited the Company’s internal controlover financial reporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO).In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of theCompany as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years inthe period ended December 31, 2021, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States ofAmerica. Also, in our opinion, the Company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financialreporting as of December 31, 2021, based on criteria established in Internal Control — Integrated Framework (2013) issuedby COSO.Basis for OpinionsThe Company’s management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control overfinancial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in theaccompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express anopinion on these financial statements and an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on ouraudits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States)(PCAOB) and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the US federal securities lawsand the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and performthe audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whetherdue to error or fraud, and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audits of the financial statements included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of thefinancial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures to respond to those risks. Such proceduresincluded examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our auditsalso included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluatingthe overall presentation of the financial statements. Our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtainingan understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testingand evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also includedperforming such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audits provide areasonable basis for our opinions.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control over Financial ReportingA company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generallyaccepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and proceduresthat (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions anddispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary topermit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts andexpenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of thecompany; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, ordisposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.\fK-68REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also,projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequatebecause of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.Critical Audit MattersThe critical audit matters communicated below are matters arising from the current-period audit of the financial statementsthat were communicated or required to be communicated to the audit committee and that (1) relate to accounts or disclosuresthat are material to the financial statements and (2) involved our especially challenging, subjective, or complex judgments.The communication of critical audit matters does not alter in any way our opinion on the financial statements, taken as awhole, and we are not, by communicating the critical audit matters below, providing separate opinions on the critical auditmatters or on the accounts or disclosures to which they relate.Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses— Refer to Notes 1 and 16 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) under short duration property and casualtyinsurance and reinsurance contracts are $86,664 million as of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions affecting certainclaim liabilities include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios, expected claim count emergence patterns, expected losspayment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence patterns.Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilitieswere appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2021, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent ofeffort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilities included the following, among others:•We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities, including those over the key assumptions.•We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities by:•Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, such as historical claims and earnedpremium, to test that the inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.•Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identifypotential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities.•With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:•We developed independent estimates of the claim liabilities, including loss data and industry claim developmentfactors as needed, and compared our estimates to management’s estimates.•We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates to test thereasonableness of the prior year estimates and assessed unexpected development.Unpaid Losses and Loss Adjustment Expenses Under Retroactive Reinsurance Contracts — Refer to Notes 1 and 17 to thefinancial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company’s unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (“claim liabilities”) for property and casualty retroactivereinsurance contracts are $38,256 million as of December 31, 2021. The key assumptions affecting certain claim liabilitiesand related deferred charge reinsurance assumed assets (“related assets”) include expected loss and expense (“loss”) ratios,expected loss payment emergence patterns and expected loss reporting emergence.Given the subjectivity of estimating these key assumptions, performing audit procedures to evaluate whether claim liabilitieswere appropriately recorded as of December 31, 2021, required a high degree of auditor judgment and an increased extent ofeffort, including the need to involve our actuarial specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to the key assumptions affecting claim liabilities and related assets included the following,among others:•We tested the operating effectiveness of controls over claim liabilities and related assets, including those over the keyassumptions.\fK-69REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM (Continued)•We evaluated the methods and assumptions used by management to estimate the claim liabilities and related assets by:•Testing the underlying data that served as the basis for the actuarial analysis, including historical claims, to test thatthe inputs to the actuarial estimate were reasonable.•Comparing management’s prior-year claim liabilities to actual development during the current year to identifypotential bias in the determination of the claim liabilities and related assets.•With the assistance of our actuarial specialists:•We developed independent claim liability estimates for certain retroactive reinsurance contracts and compared ourestimates to management’s estimates. For other retroactive reinsurance contracts and related assets, we evaluated theprocess used by management to develop the estimated claim liabilities and related assets.•We compared management’s change in ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense to prior year estimates, assessedunexpected development and assessed internal rates of return.Goodwill and Indefinite-Lived Intangible Assets — Refer to Notes 1 and 13 to the financial statementsCritical Audit Matter DescriptionThe Company’s evaluation of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment involves the comparison of thefair value of each reporting unit or asset to its carrying value. The Company evaluates goodwill and indefinite-livedintangible assets for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets forimpairment, the fair value of each reporting unit or asset is estimated. Significant judgment is required in estimating fairvalues and performing impairment tests. The Company primarily uses discounted projected future net earnings or net cashflows and multiples of earnings to estimate fair value, which requires management to make significant estimates andassumptions related to forecasts of future revenue, earnings before interest and taxes (“EBIT”), and discount rates. Changesin these assumptions could have a significant impact on the fair value of reporting units and indefinite-lived intangible assets.The Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”) reporting unit reported approximately $21 billion of goodwill and indefinite-livedintangible assets as of December 31, 2021. Given the significant judgments made by management to estimate the fair valueof the PCC reporting unit and certain customer relationships with indefinite lives along with the difference between their fairvalues and carrying values, performing audit procedures to evaluate the reasonableness of management’s estimates andassumptions related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate required a high degree ofauditor judgment and an increased extent of effort, including the need to involve our fair value specialists.How the Critical Audit Matter Was Addressed in the AuditOur audit procedures related to forecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate for the PCCreporting unit and certain customer relationships included the following, among others:•We tested the effectiveness of controls over goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets, including those over theforecasts of future revenue and EBIT and the selection of the discount rate.•We evaluated management’s ability to accurately forecast future revenue and EBIT by comparing prior yearforecasts to actual results in the respective years.•We evaluated the reasonableness of management’s current revenue and EBIT forecasts by comparing the forecaststo historical results and forecasted information included in analyst and industry reports and certain peer companies’disclosures.•With the assistance of our fair value specialists, we evaluated the valuation methodologies, the long-term growthrates and discount rate, including testing the underlying source information and the mathematical accuracy of thecalculations, and developed a range of independent estimates and compared those to the long-term growth rates anddiscount rate selected by management./s/ Deloitte & Touche LLPOmaha, NebraskaFebruary 26, 2022We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1985.\fK-70BERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.and SubsidiariesCONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS(dollars in millions)December 31,20212020ASSETSInsurance and Other:Cash and cash equivalents*$85,319$44,714Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills58,53590,300Investments in fixed maturity securities16,43420,410Investments in equity securities350,719281,170Equity method investments17,37517,303Loans and finance receivables20,75119,201Other receivables35,38832,310Inventories20,95419,208Property, plant and equipment20,83421,200Equipment held for lease14,91814,601Goodwill47,11747,121Other intangible assets28,48629,462Deferred charges -

(“Berkshire”) is a holding company owning subsidiaries engaged in a number ofdiverse business activities, including insurance and reinsurance, freight rail transportation, utilities and energy,manufacturing, service and retailing. In these notes the terms “us,” “we,” or “our” refer to Berkshire and itsconsolidated subsidiaries. Further information regarding our reportable business segments is contained in Note 25.Information concerning business acquisitions completed over the past three years appears in Note 2. We believe thatreporting the Railroad, Utilities and Energy subsidiaries separately is appropriate given the relative significance of theirlong-lived assets, capital expenditures and debt, which is not guaranteed by Berkshire.The accompanying Consolidated Financial Statements include the accounts of Berkshire consolidated with theaccounts of all subsidiaries and affiliates in which we hold a controlling financial interest as of the financial statementdate. Normally a controlling financial interest reflects ownership of a majority of the voting interests. We consolidatevariable interest entities (“VIE”) when we possess both the power to direct the activities of the VIE that mostsignificantly affect its economic performance, and we (a) are obligated to absorb the losses that could be significant tothe VIE or (b) hold the right to receive benefits from the VIE that could be significant to the VIE. Intercompanyaccounts and transactions have been eliminated.(b)Use of estimates in preparation of financial statementsWe prepare our Consolidated Financial Statements in conformity with accounting principles generally acceptedin the United States (“GAAP”) which requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period.Our estimates of unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses are subject to considerable estimation error due to theinherent uncertainty in projecting ultimate claim costs. In addition, estimates and assumptions associated with theamortization of deferred charges on retroactive reinsurance contracts, determinations of fair values of certain financialinstruments and evaluations of goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets for impairment require considerablejudgment. Actual results may differ from the estimates used in preparing our Consolidated Financial Statements.The novel coronavirus (“COVID-19”) spread rapidly across the world in 2020 and was declared a pandemic bythe World Health Organization. The government and private sector responses to contain its spread began tosignificantly affect our operating businesses in March of 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic adversely affected nearly allof our operations during 2020, although the effects varied significantly. The extent of the effects over longer terms onthe demand for certain of our products and services cannot be reasonably estimated at this time. Accordingly,significant estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements including those associated with evaluations ofcertain long-lived assets, goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment, expected credit losses on amounts owedto us and the estimations of certain losses assumed under insurance and reinsurance contracts may be subject tosignificant adjustments in future periods.(c)Cash and cash equivalents and short-term investments in U.S. Treasury BillsCash equivalents consist of demand deposit and money market accounts and investments with maturities of threemonths or less when purchased. Short-term investments in U.S. Treasury Bills consist of U.S. Treasury Bills withmaturities exceeding three months at the time of purchase and are stated at amortized cost, which approximates fairvalue.(d)Investments in fixed maturity securitiesWe classify investments in fixed maturity securities on the acquisition date and at each balance sheet date.Securities classified as held-to-maturity are carried at amortized cost, reflecting the ability and intent to hold thesecurities to maturity. Securities classified as trading are acquired with the intent to sell in the near term and are carriedat fair value with changes in fair value reported in earnings. All other securities are classified as available-for-sale andare carried at fair value. Substantially all of investments in fixed maturity securities are classified as available-for-sale.We amortize the difference between the original cost and maturity value of a fixed maturity security to earnings usingthe interest method.\fK-76Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(d)Investments in fixed maturity securities (Continued)We record investment gains and losses on available-for-sale fixed maturity securities when the securities aresold, determined on a specific identification basis. For securities in an unrealized loss position, we recognize a loss inearnings for the excess of amortized cost over fair value if we intend to sell before the price recovers. As of the balancesheet date, we evaluate whether the other unrealized losses are attributable to credit losses or other factors. We considerthe severity of the decline in value, creditworthiness of the issuer and other relevant factors. We record an allowancefor credit losses, limited to the excess of amortized cost over fair value, with a corresponding charge to earnings if thepresent value of estimated cash flows is less than the present value of contractual cash flows. The allowance may besubsequently increased or decreased based on the prevailing facts and circumstances. The portion of the unrealized lossthat we believe is not related to a credit loss is recognized in other comprehensive income.(e)Investments in equity securitiesWe carry substantially all investments in equity securities at fair value and record the subsequent changes in fairvalues in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings as a component of investment gains or losses.(f)Investments under the equity methodWe utilize the equity method to account for investments when we possess the ability to exercise significantinfluence, but not control, over the operating and financial policies of the investee. The ability to exercise significantinfluence is presumed when the investor possesses more than 20% of the voting interests of the investee. Thispresumption may be overcome based on specific facts and circumstances that demonstrate that the ability to exercisesignificant influence is restricted. We apply the equity method to investments in common stock and other investmentswhen such investments possess substantially identical subordinated interests to common stock.In applying the equity method, we record the investment at cost and subsequently increase or decrease thecarrying amount of the investment by our proportionate share of the net earnings or losses and other comprehensiveincome of the investee. We record dividends or other equity distributions as reductions in the carrying value of theinvestment. If net losses reduce our carrying amount to zero, additional net losses may be recorded if other investmentsin the investee are at-risk, even if we have not committed to provide financial support to the investee. Such additionalequity method losses, if any, are based upon the change in our claim on the investee’s book value.(g)Loans and finance receivablesLoans and finance receivables are primarily manufactured home loans, and to a lesser extent, commercial loansand site-built home loans. We carry substantially all loans and finance receivables at amortized cost, net of allowancesfor expected credit losses, based on our ability and intent to hold such loans to maturity. Acquisition costs and loanorigination and commitment costs paid and fees received, as well as acquisition premiums or discounts, are amortizedas yield adjustments over the lives of the loans.Prior to 2020, credit losses were measured when non-collection was considered probable based on the prevailingfacts and circumstances. Beginning in 2020, measurements of expected credit losses include provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Expected credit losses on manufactured home loans are based on thenet present value of future principal payments less estimated expenses related to the charge-off and foreclosure ofexpected uncollectible loans and include provisions for loans that are not in foreclosure. Our principal credit qualityindicator is whether the loans are performing. Expected credit loss estimates consider historical default rates, collateralrecovery rates, historical runoff rates, interest rates, reductions of future cash flows for modified loans and thehistorical time elapsed from last payment until foreclosure, among other factors. In addition, our estimates considercurrent conditions and reasonable and supportable forecasts.Loans are considered delinquent when payments are more than 30 days past due. We place loans over 90 dayspast due on nonaccrual status and accrued but uncollected interest is reversed. Subsequent collections on the loans arefirst applied to the principal and interest owed for the most delinquent amount. We resume interest income accrualonce a loan is less than 90 days delinquent.Loans are considered non-performing when the foreclosure process has started. Once a loan is in the process offoreclosure, interest income is not recognized until the foreclosure is cured or the loan is modified. Once a modificationis complete, interest income is recognized based on the terms of the new loan. Foreclosed loans are charged off whenthe collateral is sold. Loans not in foreclosure are evaluated for charge-off based on individual circumstancesconcerning the future collectability of the loan and the condition of the collateral securing the loan.\fK-77Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(h)Other receivablesOther receivables include balances due from customers, insurance premiums receivable and reinsurance lossesrecoverable, as well as other receivables. Trade receivables, insurance premium receivables and other receivables areprimarily short-term in nature with stated collection terms of less than one year from the date of origination.Reinsurance recoverables are comprised of amounts ceded under reinsurance contracts or pursuant to mandatorygovernment-sponsored insurance programs. Reinsurance recoverables relate to unpaid losses and loss adjustmentexpenses arising from property and casualty contracts and benefits under life and health contracts. Receivables arestated net of estimated allowances for uncollectible balances. Prior to 2020, we recorded provisions for uncollectiblebalances when it was probable counterparties or customers would be unable to pay all amounts due based on thecontractual terms and historical loss history.Beginning in 2020, we adopted a new accounting pronouncement that affects the measurement of allowances forcredit losses. In measuring credit loss allowances, we primarily utilize credit loss history, with adjustments to reflectcurrent or expected future economic conditions when reasonable and supportable forecasts of losses deviate fromhistorical experience. In evaluating expected credit losses of reinsurance recoverables on unpaid losses, we review thecredit quality of the counterparty and consider right-of-offset provisions within reinsurance contracts and other formsof credit enhancement including collateral, guarantees and other available information. We charge-off receivablesagainst the allowances after all reasonable collection efforts are exhausted.(i)DerivativesWe carry derivative contracts in accounts payable, accruals and other liabilities in our Consolidated BalanceSheets at fair value, net of reductions permitted under master netting agreements with counterparties. We record thechanges in fair value of derivative contracts that do not qualify as hedging instruments for financial reporting purposesin earnings or, if such contracts involve our regulated utilities subsidiaries, as regulatory assets or liabilities wheninclusion in regulated rates is probable.(j)Fair value measurementsAs defined under GAAP, fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer aliability between market participants in the principal market or in the most advantageous market when no principalmarket exists. Adjustments to transaction prices or quoted market prices may be required in illiquid or disorderlymarkets in estimating fair value. Alternative valuation techniques may be appropriate under the circumstances todetermine the value that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction.Market participants are assumed to be independent, knowledgeable, and able and willing to transact an exchange andnot acting under duress. Our nonperformance or credit risk is considered in determining the fair value of liabilities.Considerable judgment may be required in interpreting market data used to develop the estimates of fair value.Accordingly, estimates of fair value presented herein are not necessarily indicative of the amounts that could berealized in a current or future market exchange.(k)InventoriesInventories consist of manufactured goods, goods or products acquired for resale and homes constructed for sale.Manufactured inventory costs include materials, direct and indirect labor and factory overhead. At December 31, 2021,we used the last-in-first-out (“LIFO”) method to value approximately 31% of consolidated inventories with theremainder primarily determined under first-in-first-out and average cost methods. Non-LIFO inventories are stated atthe lower of cost or net realizable value. The excess of current or replacement costs over costs determined under LIFOwas approximately $1.9 billion as of December 31, 2021 and $1.1 billion as of December 31, 2020.(l)Property, plant and equipmentWe record additions to property, plant and equipment used in operations at cost, which includes asset additions,improvements and betterments. With respect to constructed assets, all materials, direct labor and contract services aswell as certain indirect costs are capitalized. Indirect costs include interest over the construction period. With respect toconstructed assets of our utility and energy subsidiaries that are subject to authoritative guidance for regulatedoperations, capitalized costs also include an allowance for funds used during construction, which represents the cost ofequity funds used to finance the construction of the regulated facilities. Normal repairs and maintenance and othercosts that do not improve the property, extend its useful life or otherwise do not meet capitalization criteria are chargedto expense as incurred.\fK-78Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(l)Property, plant and equipment (Continued)Depreciation of assets of our regulated utilities and railroad is generally determined using group depreciationmethods where rates are based on periodic depreciation studies approved by the applicable regulator. Under groupdepreciation, a composite rate is applied to the gross investment in a particular class of property, despite differences inthe service life or salvage value of individual property units within the same class. When such assets are retired or sold,no gain or loss is recognized. Gains or losses on disposals of all other assets are recorded through earnings.We depreciate property, plant and equipment used by our other businesses to the estimated salvage valueprimarily using the straight-line method over estimated useful lives. Ranges of estimated useful lives of depreciableassets used in our other businesses are as follows: buildings and improvements – 5 to 50 years, machinery andequipment – 3 to 25 years and furniture, fixtures and other – 3 to 15 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives ofdepreciable assets unique to our railroad business are as follows: track structure and other roadway – 10 to 100 yearsand locomotives, freight cars and other equipment – 6 to 43 years. Ranges of estimated useful lives of assets unique toour regulated utilities and energy businesses are as follows: utility generation, transmission and distribution systems –5 to 80 years, interstate natural gas pipeline assets – 3 to 80 years and independent power plants and other assets – 2 to50 years.We evaluate property, plant and equipment for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicatethat the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable or when the assets are held for sale. Upon the occurrenceof a triggering event, we assess whether the estimated undiscounted cash flows expected from the use of the asset andthe residual value from the ultimate disposal of the asset exceeds the carrying value. If the carrying value exceeds theestimated recoverable amounts, we reduce the carrying value to fair value and record an impairment loss in earnings,except with respect to impairment of assets of our regulated utility and energy subsidiaries where the impacts ofregulation are considered in evaluating the carrying value.(m)LeasesWe are party to contracts where we lease property to others (“lessor” contracts) and where we lease propertyfrom others (“lessee” contracts). We record acquisitions of and additions to equipment that we lease to others at cost.We depreciate equipment held for lease to estimated salvage value primarily using the straight-line method overestimated useful lives ranging from 3 to 35 years. We use declining balance depreciation methods for assets when therevenue-earning power of the asset is greater during the earlier years of its life. We also evaluate equipment held forlease for impairment consistent with policies for property, plant and equipment.When we lease assets from others, we record right-of-use assets and lease liabilities. Right-of-use assetsrepresent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and lease liabilities represent our obligation to makelease payments arising from the lease. In this regard, lease payments include fixed payments and variable paymentsthat depend on an index or rate. The lease term is generally considered the non-cancellable lease period. Certain leasecontracts contain renewal options or other terms that provide for variable payments based on performance or usage.Options are not included in determining right-of-use assets or lease liabilities unless it is reasonably certain that optionswill be exercised. Generally, incremental borrowing rates are used in measuring lease liabilities. Right-of-use assets aresubject to review for impairment. As permitted under GAAP, we do not separate lease components from non-leasecomponents by class of asset and do not record assets or liabilities for leases with terms of one year or less.(n)Goodwill and other intangible assetsGoodwill represents the excess of the acquisition price of a business over the fair value of identified net assets ofthat business. We evaluate goodwill for impairment at least annually. When evaluating goodwill for impairment, weestimate the fair value of the reporting unit. Several methods may be used to estimate a reporting unit’s fair value,including market quotations, asset and liability fair values and other valuation techniques, including, but not limited to,discounted projected future net earnings or net cash flows and multiples of earnings. When the carrying amount of areporting unit, including goodwill, exceeds the estimated fair value, the excess is charged to earnings as an impairmentloss.Intangible assets with indefinite lives are also tested for impairment at least annually and when events or changesin circumstances indicate that, more-likely-than-not, the asset is impaired. Significant judgment is required inestimating fair values and performing goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment tests. We amortizeintangible assets with finite lives in a pattern that reflects the expected consumption of related economic benefits or ona straight-line basis over the estimated economic useful lives. Intangible assets with finite lives are reviewed forimpairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable.\fK-79Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(o)Revenue recognitionWe earn insurance premiums on prospective property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts over the lossexposure or coverage period in proportion to the level of protection provided. Premiums are generally earned inproportion to the coverage provided, which is generally ratable over the term of the contract with unearned premiumscomputed on a monthly or daily pro-rata basis. Premiums on retroactive property/casualty reinsurance contracts aregenerally received in full and are earned at the inception of the contracts, as all underlying loss events covered by thepolicies occurred prior to contract inception. Premiums for life reinsurance and periodic payment annuity contracts areearned when due. Premiums for periodic payment annuity contracts are usually received in full at the inception of thecontracts. Premiums earned are stated net of amounts ceded to reinsurers. Premiums earned on contracts withexperience-rating provisions reflect estimated loss experience under such contracts.Sales and service revenues are recognized when goods or services are transferred to a customer. A good orservice is transferred when (or as) the customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on theconsideration we expect to receive in connection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers.We manufacture and/or distribute a wide variety of industrial, building and consumer products. Our salescontracts provide customers with these products through wholesale and retail channels in exchange for considerationspecified under the contracts. Contracts generally represent customer orders for individual products at stated prices.Sales contracts may contain either single or multiple performance obligations. In instances where contracts containmultiple performance obligations, we allocate the revenue to each obligation based on the relative stand-alone sellingprices of each product or service.Sales revenue reflects reductions for returns, allowances, volume discounts and other incentives, some of whichmay be contingent on future events. In certain customer contracts, sales revenue includes certain state and local excisetaxes billed to customers on specified products when those taxes are levied directly upon us by the taxing authorities.Sales revenue excludes sales taxes and value-added taxes collected on behalf of taxing authorities. Sales revenueincludes consideration for shipping and other fulfillment activities performed prior to the customer obtaining control ofthe goods. We also elect to treat consideration for such services performed after control has passed to the customer assales revenue.Our product sales revenues are generally recognized at a point in time when control of the product transfers tothe customer, which coincides with customer pickup or product delivery or acceptance, depending on terms of thearrangement. We recognize sales revenues and related costs with respect to certain contracts over time, primarily fromcertain castings, forgings and aerostructures contracts. Control of the product units under these contracts transferscontinuously to the customer as the product is manufactured. These products generally have no alternative use and thecontract requires the customer to provide reasonable compensation if terminated for reasons other than breach ofcontract.The primary performance obligation under our freight rail transportation service contracts is to move freightfrom a point of origin to a point of destination. The performance obligations are represented by bills of lading whichcreate a series of distinct services that have a similar pattern of transfer to the customer. The revenues for eachperformance obligation are based on various factors including the product being shipped, the origin and destinationpair and contract incentives, which are outlined in various private rate agreements, common carrier public tariffs,interline foreign road agreements and pricing quotes. The transaction price is generally a per car/unit amount totransport railcars from a specified origin to a specified destination. Freight revenues are recognized over time as theservice is performed because the customer simultaneously receives and consumes the benefits of the service. Revenuesrecognized represent the proportion of the service completed as of the balance sheet date. Invoices for freighttransportation services are generally issued to customers and paid within 30 days or less. Customer incentives, whichare primarily provided for shipping a specified cumulative volume or shipping to/from specific locations, are recordedas a reduction to revenue on a pro-rata basis based on actual or projected future customer shipments.\fK-80Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(o)Revenue recognition (Continued)Our energy revenue derives primarily from tariff-based sales arrangements approved by various regulatorycommissions. These tariff-based revenues are mainly comprised of energy, transmission, distribution and natural gasand have performance obligations to deliver energy products and services to customers which are satisfied over time asenergy is delivered or services are provided. Our nonregulated energy revenue primarily relates to our renewableenergy business. Energy revenues are equivalent to the amounts we have the right to invoice and correspond directlywith the value to the customer of the performance to date and include billed and unbilled amounts. Payments fromcustomers are generally due within 30 days of billing. Rates charged for energy products and services are establishedby regulators or contractual arrangements that establish the transaction price, as well as the allocation of price amongthe separate performance obligations. When preliminary regulated rates are permitted to be billed prior to finalapproval by the applicable regulator, certain revenue collected may be subject to refund and a liability for estimatedrefunds is accrued. Other service revenues derive from contracts with customers in which performance obligations aresatisfied over time, where customers receive and consume benefits as we perform the services or at a point in timewhen the services are provided. Other service revenues primarily derive from real estate brokerage, automotive repair,aircraft management, aviation training, franchising and news distribution.Leasing revenue is generally recognized ratably over the term of the lease or based on usage, if applicable underthe terms of the contract. A substantial portion of our lessor contracts are classified as operating leases.(p)Losses and loss adjustment expensesWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under property/casualty insurance andreinsurance contracts for loss events that have occurred on or before the balance sheet date. Such liabilities representthe estimated ultimate payment amounts without discounting for time value.We base liability estimates on (1) loss reports from policyholders and cedents, (2) individual case estimates and(3) estimates of incurred but not reported losses. Losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statementsof Earnings include paid claims, claim settlement costs and changes in estimated claim liabilities. Losses and lossadjustment expenses charged to earnings are net of amounts recovered and estimates of amounts recoverable underceded reinsurance contracts. Reinsurance contracts do not relieve the ceding company of its obligations to indemnifypolicyholders with respect to the underlying insurance and reinsurance contracts.(q)Retroactive reinsurance contractsWe record liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses under short duration retroactive reinsurancecontracts consistent with property/casualty insurance and reinsurance contracts described in Note 1(p). With respect toretroactive reinsurance contracts, we also record deferred charge assets at the inception of the contracts, representingthe excess, if any, of the estimated ultimate claim liabilities over the premiums earned. We subsequently amortize thedeferred charge assets over the expected claim settlement periods using the interest method. Changes to the estimatedtiming or amount of future loss payments also produce changes in deferred charge balances. We apply changes in suchestimates retrospectively and the resulting changes in deferred charge balances, together with periodic amortization, areincluded in insurance losses and loss adjustment expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Earnings.(r)Insurance policy acquisition costsWe capitalize the incremental costs that directly relate to the successful sale of insurance contracts, subject toultimate recoverability. For short duration contracts, we subsequently amortize such costs to underwriting expenses asthe related premiums are earned. Acquisition costs related to long duration life insurance contracts are amortized overthe expected premium-paying period in proportion to the anticipated premiums over the life of the policy. Suchanticipated premiums are estimated using the same assumptions used for computing liabilities for future policybenefits. Direct incremental acquisition costs include commissions, premium taxes and certain other costs associatedwith successful efforts. We expense all other underwriting costs as incurred. The recoverability of capitalized insurancepolicy acquisition costs generally reflects anticipation of investment income. The unamortized balances are included inother assets and were approximately $3.4 billion and $3.25 billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.\fK-81Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(s)Life and annuity insurance benefitsWe compute liabilities for benefits under life insurance contracts based upon estimated future investment yields,expected mortality, morbidity and lapse or withdrawal rates, as well as estimates of premiums we expect to receive andexpenses we expect to incur in the future. These assumptions, as applicable, also include a margin for adversedeviation and may vary with the characteristics of the contract’s date of issuance, policy duration and country of risk.The interest rate assumptions used may vary by contract or jurisdiction. We discount periodic payment annuityliabilities based on the implicit rate as of the inception of the contracts such that the present value of the liabilitiesequals the premiums. Discount rates for most contracts range from 3% to 7%.(t)Regulated utilities and energy businessesCertain energy subsidiaries prepare their financial statements in accordance with authoritative guidance forregulated operations, reflecting the economic effects of regulation from the ability to recover certain costs fromcustomers and the requirement to return revenues to customers in the future through the regulated rate-setting process.Accordingly, certain costs are deferred as regulatory assets and certain income is accrued as regulatory liabilities.Regulatory assets and liabilities will be amortized into operating expenses and revenues over various future periods.Regulatory assets and liabilities are continually assessed for probable future inclusion in regulatory rates byconsidering factors such as applicable regulatory or legislative changes and recent rate orders received by otherregulated entities. If future inclusion in regulatory rates ceases to be probable, the amount no longer probable ofinclusion in regulatory rates is charged or credited to earnings (or other comprehensive income, if applicable) orreturned to customers.(u)Foreign currencyThe accounts of our non-U.S. based subsidiaries are measured, in most instances, using functional currenciesother than the U.S. Dollar. Revenues and expenses in the financial statements of these subsidiaries are translated intoU.S. Dollars at the average exchange rate for the period and assets and liabilities are translated at the exchange rate asof the end of the reporting period. The net effects of translating the financial statements of these subsidiaries areincluded in shareholders’ equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. Gains and losses arisingfrom transactions denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the reporting entity, including gainsand losses from the remeasurement of assets and liabilities due to changes in currency exchange rates, are included inearnings.(v)Income taxesBerkshire files a consolidated federal income tax return in the United States, which includes eligible subsidiaries.In addition, we file income tax returns in state, local and foreign jurisdictions as applicable. Provisions for currentincome tax liabilities are calculated and accrued on income and expense amounts expected to be included in the incometax returns for the current year. Income taxes reported in earnings also include deferred income tax provisions.Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed on differences between the financial statement bases andtax bases of assets and liabilities at the enacted tax rates. Changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilitiesassociated with components of other comprehensive income are charged or credited directly to other comprehensiveincome. Otherwise, changes in deferred income tax assets and liabilities are included as a component of income taxexpense. The effect on deferred income tax assets and liabilities attributable to changes in enacted tax rates are chargedor credited to income tax expense in the period of enactment. Valuation allowances are established for certain deferredtax assets when realization is not likely.Assets and liabilities are established for uncertain tax positions taken or positions expected to be taken in incometax returns when such positions, in our judgment, do not meet a more-likely-than-not threshold based on the technicalmerits of the positions. Estimated interest and penalties related to uncertain tax positions are included as a componentof income tax expense.\fK-82Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(1)Significant accounting policies and practices (Continued)(w)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2020We adopted Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 326 “Financial Instruments-Credit Losses” on January1, 2020. ASC 326 provides for the measurement of expected credit losses on financial assets that are carried atamortized cost based on the net amounts expected to be collected. Measurements of expected credit losses thereforeinclude provisions for non-collection, whether the risk is probable or remote. Prior to the adoption of ASC 326, creditlosses were measured when non-collection was considered probable. Upon adoption of ASC 326, we recorded a chargeto retained earnings of $388 million representing the cumulative after-tax increase in our allowances for credit losses.(x)New accounting pronouncements adopted in 2019Berkshire adopted ASC 842 “Leases” on January 1, 2019 with respect to contracts in effect as of the adoptionand elected to not restate prior period financial statements. Most significantly, ASC 842 requires a lessee to recognize aliability to make operating lease payments and an asset with respect to its right to use the underlying asset for the leaseterm. Upon adoption, we recorded operating lease right-of-use assets of approximately $6.2 billion, lease liabilities of$5.9 billion and reduced other assets by approximately $300 million.(y)New accounting pronouncements to be adopted subsequent to December 31, 2021In August 2018, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued Accounting Standards Update 2018-12“Targeted Improvements to the Accounting for Long-Duration Contracts” (“ASU 2018-12”). ASU 2018-12 requiresreassessment of cash flow assumptions at least annually and revision of discount rate assumptions each reportingperiod in valuing policyholder liabilities and related deferred acquisition costs of long-duration insurance andreinsurance contracts. The effects from changes in cash flow assumptions are reflected in earnings and the effects fromchanges in discount rate assumptions are reflected in other comprehensive income. Currently, the cash flow anddiscount rate assumptions are set at the contract inception date and not subsequently changed, except under limitedcircumstances. ASU 2018-12 is to be applied retrospectively to the earliest period presented in the financial statements,requires new disclosures and is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2022, with early adoptionpermitted.We currently intend to adopt ASU 2018-12 as of January 1, 2023 using the modified retrospective method,which provides that the revised cash flow and discount rate assumptions as of January 1, 2021 (the transition date) beapplied to contracts then in-force, with liabilities then remeasured as provided under the standard. The cumulativeeffects from discount rate assumption changes as of the transition date will be reflected in accumulated othercomprehensive income and the cumulative effect from cash flow assumption changes will be included in retainedearnings. While we have not finalized our assessment of the impact of the adoption as of the transition date, wecurrently believe that the changes in discount rate assumptions will have a greater effect on our recorded liabilities thanchanges in cash flow assumptions. We also preliminarily estimate that the changes in discount rate assumptions as ofJanuary 1, 2021 will increase our life, health and annuity benefit liabilities from the amounts previously reported due tothe historically low interest rate environment at that time. However, the ultimate impact of adopting ASU 2018-12 willbe based on the discount rate and cash flow assumptions determined as of the January 1, 2023 adoption date. We,therefore, continue to evaluate the effect this standard will have on our Consolidated Financial Statements.(2)Business acquisitionsOur long-held acquisition strategy is to acquire businesses that have consistent earning power, good returns on equityand able and honest management. Financial results attributable to business acquisitions are included in our ConsolidatedFinancial Statements beginning on their respective acquisition dates.Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) acquired certain businesses of Dominion Energy, Inc. (“Dominion”) onNovember 1, 2020, pursuant to a definitive agreement with Dominion in July 2020. The acquired businesses included naturalgas transmission, gathering and storage pipelines, natural gas storage capacity and partial ownership of a liquefied natural gasexport, import and storage facility (“Cove Point”). In October 2020, BHE and Dominion also agreed to provide for theexclusion of certain pipeline businesses from the initial agreement and entered into a second acquisition agreement withrespect to the excluded pipeline businesses. The closing of the second agreement was subject to regulatory and customaryclosing conditions; however, in July 2021, BHE and Dominion agreed to terminate the second agreement.\fK-83Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(2)Business acquisitions (Continued)The cost of the acquisition was approximately $2.5 billion after post-closing adjustments as provided in the agreement.The fair values of identified assets acquired and liabilities assumed and residual goodwill are summarized as follows (inmillions).Property, plant and equipment$9,264Goodwill1,741Other2,398Assets acquired$13,403Notes payable and other borrowings$5,615Other1,358Liabilities assumed6,973Noncontrolling interests3,916Net assets$2,514As part of this acquisition, BHE acquired an indirect 25% economic interest in Cove Point, consisting of 100% of thegeneral partnership interest and 25% of the limited partnership interests. We concluded that Cove Point is a VIE and that wehave the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact its economic performance as well as the obligation toabsorb losses and receive benefits which could be significant to Cove Point. Therefore, we treat Cove Point as a consolidatedsubsidiary. The noncontrolling interests are attributable to the limited partner interests held by third parties.In each of the past three years, we also completed several smaller-sized business acquisitions, which we consider as“bolt-ons” to several of our existing business operations. We do not believe that these acquisitions are material, individuallyor in the aggregate to our Consolidated Financial Statements.(3)Investments in fixed maturity securitiesInvestments in fixed maturity securities as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 are summarized by type below (inmillions).AmortizedCostUnrealizedGainsUnrealizedLossesFairValueDecember 31, 2021U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies $3,286$22$(5) $3,303Foreign governments10,99829(33)10,994Corporate bonds1,363412(1)1,774Other31747(1)363$15,964$510$(40) $16,434December 31, 2020U.S. Treasury, U.S. government corporations and agencies $3,348$55$—$3,403Foreign governments11,233110(5)11,338Corporate bonds4,729464(2)5,191Other41466(2)478$19,724$695$(9) $20,410Investments in foreign governments include securities issued by national and provincial government entities as well asinstruments that are unconditionally guaranteed by such entities.

These investments were acquired for a total of $10 billion and consist ofOccidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock with an aggregate liquidation value of $10 billion and warrants, whichcurrently permit us to purchase up to 83.86 million shares of Occidental common stock at an exercise price of $59.62 pershare. The preferred stock accrues dividends at 8% per annum and is redeemable at the option of Occidental commencing in2029 at a redemption price equal to 105% of the liquidation preference plus any accumulated and unpaid dividends and ismandatorily redeemable under certain specified events. The warrants are exercisable in whole or in part until one year afterthe redemption of the preferred stock.(5)Equity method investmentsBerkshire and its subsidiaries hold investments in certain businesses that are accounted for pursuant to the equitymethod. Currently, the most significant of these is our investment in the common stock of The Kraft Heinz Company (“KraftHeinz”). Kraft Heinz is one of the world’s largest manufacturers and marketers of food and beverage products, includingcondiments and sauces, cheese and dairy, meals, meats, refreshment beverages, coffee and other grocery products. Berkshirecurrently owns 26.6% of the outstanding shares of Kraft Heinz common stock.We recorded equity method earnings from our investment in Kraft Heinz of $269 million in 2021, $95 million in 2020and $493 million in 2019. Equity method earnings included the effects of goodwill and identifiable intangible assetimpairment charges recorded by Kraft Heinz. Our share of such charges was approximately $350 million in 2021, $850million in 2020 and $450 million in 2019. We received dividends from Kraft Heinz of $521 million in each of 2021, 2020and 2019, which we recorded as reductions in our carrying value.Shares of Kraft Heinz common stock are publicly-traded and the fair value of our investment was approximately $11.7billion at December 31, 2021 and $11.3 billion at December 31, 2020. The carrying value of our investment wasapproximately $13.1 billion at December 31, 2021 and $13.3 billion at December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2021, thecarrying value of our investment exceeded the fair value based on the quoted market price by approximately 11% of thecarrying value. We evaluated our investment in Kraft Heinz for impairment. Based on the prevailing facts and circumstances,we concluded recognition of an impairment charge in earnings was not required as of December 31, 2021.\fK-85Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(5)Equity method investments (Continued)Summarized consolidated financial information of Kraft Heinz follows (in millions).December 25,2021December 26,2020Assets$93,394$99,830Liabilities43,94249,587Year endingDecember 25,2021Year endingDecember 26,2020Year endingDecember 28,2019Sales$26,042$26,185$24,977Net earnings attributable to Kraft Heinz common shareholders$1,012$356$1,935Other investments accounted for pursuant to the equity method include our investments in Berkadia CommercialMortgage LLC (“Berkadia”), Pilot Travel Centers LLC (“Pilot”), Electric Transmission Texas, LLC (“ETT”) and beginningin 2021, Iroquois Gas Transmission System L.P.

Our equity method earnings inthese entities were $726 million in 2021, $631 million in 2020 and $683 million in 2019. During 2021, we receiveddistributions of approximately $1.2 billion from these investees. Additional information concerning these investmentsfollows.We own a 50% interest in Berkadia, with Jefferies Financial Group Inc. (“Jefferies”) owning the other 50% interest.Berkadia is a servicer of commercial real estate loans in the U.S., performing primary, master and special servicing functionsfor U.S. government agency programs, commercial mortgage-backed securities transactions, banks, insurance companies andother financial institutions. Berkadia funds a portion of its operations through commercial paper borrowings, which arecurrently limited to $1.5 billion. On December 31, 2021, Berkadia’s commercial paper outstanding was $1.47 billion.Berkadia’s commercial paper is supported by a surety policy issued by a Berkshire insurance subsidiary. Jefferies is obligatedto indemnify us for one-half of any losses incurred under the policy. BHE subsidiaries own a 50% noncontrolling interest inETT, an owner and operator of electric transmission assets in Texas and a 50% noncontrolling interest in Iroquois, whichowns and operates a natural gas pipeline located in New York and Connecticut.We own a 38.6% interest in Pilot, headquartered in Knoxville, Tennessee.

Asreflected in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows, we received proceeds of approximately $15.8 billion in 2021, $38.8billion in 2020 and $14.3 billion in 2019 from sales of equity securities. In the preceding table, investment gains and losseson equity securities sold during the year represent the difference between the sales proceeds and the fair value of the equitysecurities sold at the beginning of the applicable year or, if later, the purchase date. Our taxable gains and losses on equitysecurities sold are generally the difference between the proceeds from sales and original cost. Taxable gains were $3.6 billionin 2021, $6.2 billion in 2020 and $3.2 billion in 2019.The derivative contract gains and losses derive from equity index put option contracts written prior to March 2008 onfour major equity indexes.

We recorded goodwill impairment charges of approximately $10billion and indefinite-lived intangible asset impairment charges of $638 million in the second quarter of 2020. Approximately$10 billion of these charges pertained to Precision Castparts Corp. (“PCC”), one of the largest businesses within Berkshire’smanufacturing segment. The carrying values of PCC-related goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible assets prior to theimpairment charges were approximately $31 billion. The impairment charges were determined based on discounted cash flowmethods and reflected our assessments of the risks and uncertainties associated with the aerospace industry.

Statutory surplus differs from the corresponding amount based on GAAP, due to differences in accounting for certainassets and liabilities. For instance, deferred charges reinsurance assumed, deferred policy acquisition costs, unrealized gainson certain investments and related deferred income taxes are recognized for GAAP but not for statutory reporting purposes.In addition, the carrying values of certain assets, such as goodwill and non-insurance entities owned by our insurancesubsidiaries, are not fully recognized for statutory reporting purposes.\fK-91Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expensesOur liabilities for unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (also referred to as “claim liabilities”) under property andcasualty insurance and reinsurance contracts are based upon estimates of the ultimate claim costs associated with claimoccurrences as of the balance sheet date and include estimates for incurred-but-not-reported (“IBNR”) claims.

Incurred and paid losses and loss adjustment expenses are net of reinsurance recoveries. Current accident yearincurred losses included approximately $2.9 billion in 2021, $950 million in 2020 and $1.0 billion in 2019 from significantcatastrophe events (losses in excess of $100 million per event) occurring in the respective year. Current accident yearincurred losses from private passenger auto insurance also increased significantly in 2021 as compared to 2020, primarily dueto increased claims frequencies and severities. In 2020, current accident year incurred losses reflected low private passengerauto claims frequencies and increased loss estimates for certain commercial insurance and reinsurance business attributable tothe COVID-19 pandemic.We recorded net reductions of estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years of $3.1 billion in 2021, $356million in 2020 and $752 million in 2019, which produced corresponding reductions in incurred losses and loss adjustmentexpenses in those periods. These reductions, as percentages of the net liabilities at the beginning of each year, were 4.0% in2021, 0.5% in 2020 and 1.1% in 2019.Estimated ultimate liabilities for prior accident years from primary insurance were reduced by $2.4 billion in 2021,$518 million in 2020 and $457 million in 2019. The reductions in 2021 and 2020 derived primarily from private passengerauto and medical professional liability claims. In both 2021 and 2020, we also lowered estimated ultimate liabilities for prioraccident years with respect to workers’ compensation claims, which were largely offset by increases in ultimate liabilities forother casualty claims. The decrease in incurred losses for prior accident years in 2019 reflected reductions in medicalprofessional liability and workers’ compensation estimates partially offset by higher other casualty estimates. Estimatedultimate liabilities for prior accident years related to property and casualty reinsurance decreased $718 million in 2021,increased $162 million in 2020 and decreased $295 million in 2019. The increase in 2020 included increased claimsestimates for legacy casualty exposures.\fK-92Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)Estimated net claim liabilities for environmental, asbestos and other latent injury exposures were approximately $2.1billion at December 31, 2021 and 2020.

For such claims, we establish and evaluate unpaid claim liabilities using standard actuarial loss development methodsand techniques. The actuarial methods utilize historical claims data, adjusted when deemed appropriate to reflect perceivedchanges in loss patterns. Claim liabilities include average, case, case development and IBNR estimates.We establish average liabilities based on expected severities for newly reported physical damage and liability claimsprior to establishing individual case reserves when insufficient time or information is available for specific claim estimatesand for large volumes of minor physical damage claims that once reported are quickly settled. We establish case lossestimates for liability claims, including estimates for loss adjustment expenses, as the facts and merits of the claim areevaluated.Claim estimates for liability coverages normally reflect greater uncertainty than physical damage coverages, primarilydue to the longer claim-tails, the greater chance of litigation and the time needed to evaluate facts at the time the caseestimate is first established. The “claim-tail” is the period between the claim occurrence date and claim settlement or paymentdate. Consequently, we establish additional case development liabilities, which are usually percentages of the case liabilities.For unreported claims, IBNR liabilities are estimated by projecting the ultimate number of claims expected (reported andunreported) for each significant coverage and deducting reported claims to produce estimated unreported claims. The productof the average cost per unreported claim and the number of unreported claims produces the IBNR liability estimate. We mayrecord supplemental IBNR liabilities in certain situations when actuarial techniques are difficult to apply.\fK-93Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)GEICO’s net incurred and paid auto physical damage and liability losses and ALAE are summarized by accident yearbelow. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021. Claim counts are established when accidents thatmay result in a liability are reported and are based on policy coverage.

We may independently evaluate case losses reported by the ceding company, and if deemedappropriate, we may establish case liabilities based on our estimates.\fK-96Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(16)Unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses (Continued)Estimated IBNR liabilities are affected by expected case loss emergence patterns and expected loss ratios, which areevaluated as groups of contracts with similar exposures or on a contract-by-contract basis. Estimated case and IBNRliabilities for major catastrophe events are generally based on a per-contract assessment of the ultimate cost associated withthe individual loss event. Claim count data is not provided consistently by ceding companies under our contracts or isotherwise considered unreliable.Net incurred and paid losses and ALAE of BHRG are disaggregated based on losses that are expected to have shorterclaim-tails (property) and losses expected to have longer claim-tails (casualty). Under certain contracts, the coverage canapply to multiple lines of business written by the ceding company, whether property, casualty or combined, and the cedingcompany may not report loss data by such lines consistently, if at all. In those instances, we allocated losses to property andcasualty coverages based on internal estimates. BHRG’s disaggregated incurred and paid losses and ALAE are summarizedby accident year. IBNR and case development liabilities are as of December 31, 2021.

Claims paymentsmay commence immediately after the contract date or, when applicable, after a contractual retention amount has beenreached.

We do not believe that analysis of losses incurred andpaid by accident year of the underlying event is relevant or meaningful given that our exposure to losses incepts when thecontract incepts. Further, we believe the classifications of reported claims and case development liabilities have little or nopractical analytical value.Currently, our largest retroactive reinsurance contract is between our subsidiary, National Indemnity Company, andcertain subsidiaries of American International Group, Inc. (collectively, “AIG”). Our estimated unpaid claim liabilities withregard to the AIG contract were approximately $15.8 billion at December 31, 2021 and $17.7 billion at December 31, 2020.Claim payments under this contract commenced in 2021 and were $1.2 billion during 2021. Deferred charges related to theAIG contract were approximately $4.5 billion at December 31, 2021 and $5.4 billion at December 31, 2020.Incurred losses and loss adjustment expenses related to contracts written in prior years were $845 million in 2021,$907 million in 2020 and $1,188 million in 2019, which included recurring amortization of deferred charges and the effect ofchanges in the timing and amount of expected future loss payments.In establishing retroactive reinsurance claim liabilities, we analyze historical aggregate loss payment patterns andproject losses into the future under various probability-weighted scenarios. We expect the claim-tail to be very long for manycontracts, with some lasting several decades. We monitor claim payment activity and review ceding company reports andother information concerning the underlying losses. We reassess and revise the expected timing and amounts of ultimatelosses periodically or when significant events are revealed through our monitoring and review processes.Estimated claim liabilities for retroactive reinsurance included estimates for environmental, asbestos and other latentinjury exposures of approximately $12.3 billion at December 31, 2021 and $12.5 billion at December 31, 2020. Retroactivereinsurance contracts are generally subject to aggregate policy limits and thus, our exposure to such claims under thesecontracts is likewise limited. We monitor evolving case law and its effect on environmental and other latent injury claims.Changing laws or government regulations, newly identified toxins, newly reported claims, new theories of liability, newcontract interpretations and other factors could result in increases in these liabilities, which could be material to our results ofoperations. We are unable to reliably estimate the amount of additional net loss or the range of net loss that is reasonablypossible.\fK-99Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(18)Notes payable and other borrowingsNotes payable and other borrowings are summarized below (in millions).

In January 2022, Berkshire repaid $600 million of maturing debt and issued ¥128.5 billion (approximately $1.1 billion) of senior notes with maturity dates ranging from 2027 to 2052 and a weighted average interest rate of 0.5%.Borrowings of BHFC, a wholly owned finance subsidiary of Berkshire, consist of senior unsecured notes used to fund manufactured housing loans originated or acquired and equipment held for lease of certain subsidiaries. BHFC borrowings are fully and unconditionally guaranteed by Berkshire. In 2021, BHFC repaid $750 million of maturing senior notes and issued $750 million of 2.5% senior notes due in 2051.The carrying values of Berkshire and BHFC non-U.S. Dollar denominated senior notes (€6.9 billion, £1.75 billion and¥785.5 billion par) reflect the applicable exchange rates as of the balance sheet dates. The effects of changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates during the period are recorded in earnings as a component of selling, general and administrativeexpenses. Changes in the exchange rates resulted in pre-tax gains of $1.3 billion in 2021, pre-tax losses of $1.0 billion in2020 and pre-tax gains of $192 million in 2019.Berkshire also guarantees debt of other subsidiaries, aggregating approximately $3.8 billion at December 31, 2021.Generally, Berkshire’s guarantee of a subsidiary’s debt obligation is an absolute, unconditional and irrevocable guarantee forthe full and prompt payment when due of all payment obligations.WeightedAverageDecember 31,Interest Rate20212020Railroad, utilities and energy:Berkshire Hathaway Energy Company (“BHE”) and subsidiaries:BHE senior unsecured debt due 2023-20514.3% $13,003 $13,447Subsidiary and other debt due 2022-20644.1%36,75936,420Short-term borrowings1.4%2,0092,286Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) and subsidiaries due 2022-20974.5%23,21923,220$74,990 $75,373BHE subsidiary debt represents amounts issued pursuant to separate financing agreements.

We have settled income taxliabilities with the U.S. federal taxing authority (“IRS”) for tax years through 2011. The U.S. federal income tax returns from2012 through 2019 remain open, and tax years 2014 through 2019 are under audit. We are also under audit or subject to auditwith respect to income taxes in many state and foreign jurisdictions. It is reasonably possible that certain of these income taxexaminations will be settled in 2022. We currently do not believe that the outcome of unresolved issues or claims will bematerial to our Consolidated Financial Statements.At December 31, 2021 and 2020, net unrecognized tax benefits were $1,046 million and $1,113 million, respectively.Included in the balance at December 31, 2021, were $878 million of tax positions that, if recognized, would impact theeffective tax rate. The remaining balance in net unrecognized tax benefits principally relates to tax positions where theultimate recognition is highly certain but there is uncertainty about the timing of recognition. Because of the impact ofdeferred income tax accounting, these positions, when recognized, would not affect the annual effective income tax rate.Other differences, net included expense of $60 million in 2020 and $377 million in 2019 for uncertain tax positions related toinvestments by a subsidiary in certain tax equity investment funds that generated income tax benefits from 2015 through2018.

Thehierarchy for measuring fair value consists of Levels 1 through 3, which are described below.Level 1 – Inputs represent unadjusted quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities exchanged in active markets.Level 2 – Inputs include directly or indirectly observable inputs (other than Level 1 inputs) such as quoted pricesfor similar assets or liabilities exchanged in active or inactive markets; quoted prices for identical assets or liabilitiesexchanged in inactive markets; other inputs that may be considered in fair value determinations of the assets orliabilities, such as interest rates and yield curves, volatilities, prepayment speeds, loss severities, credit risks and defaultrates; and inputs that are derived principally from or corroborated by observable market data by correlation or othermeans. Pricing evaluations generally reflect discounted expected future cash flows, which incorporate yield curves forinstruments with similar characteristics, such as credit ratings, estimated durations and yields for other instruments ofthe issuer or entities in the same industry sector.Level 3 – Inputs include unobservable inputs used in the measurement of assets and liabilities. Management isrequired to use its own assumptions regarding unobservable inputs because there is little, if any, market activity in theassets or liabilities and it may be unable to corroborate the related observable inputs. Unobservable inputs requiremanagement to make certain projections and assumptions about the information that would be used by marketparticipants in valuing assets or liabilities.Reconciliations of assets and liabilities measured and carried at fair value on a recurring basis with the use ofsignificant unobservable inputs (Level 3) for each of the three years ending December 31, 2021 follow (in millions).Balance atbeginningof yearGains (losses)included inearningsAcquisitions,dispositionsandsettlementsTransfers outof Level 3Balance atDecember 31,Investments in equity securities:2021$8,978$1,902$1,100$(500)$11,480202010,405(1,426)—(1)8,9782019140410,000—10,405Equity index put option contract liabilities:2021$(1,065)$966$—$99$—2020(968)(159)62—(1,065)2019(2,452)1,484——(968)We acquired investments in Occidental Cumulative Perpetual Preferred Stock (“Occidental Preferred”) and Occidentalcommon stock warrants in August 2019 at an aggregate cost of $10 billion.

Class B common stock possesses dividend anddistribution rights equal to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of such rights of Class A common stock. Each Class B commonshare possesses voting rights equal to one-ten-thousandth (1/10,000) of the voting rights of a Class A share. Unless otherwiserequired under Delaware General Corporation Law, Class A and Class B common shares vote as a single class. Each share ofClass A common stock is convertible, at the option of the holder, into 1,500 shares of Class B common stock. Class Bcommon stock is not convertible into Class A common stock. On an equivalent Class A common stock basis, there were1,477,429 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2021 and 1,543,960 shares outstanding as of December 31, 2020.Since we have two classes of common stock, we provide earnings per share data on the Consolidated Statements ofEarnings for average equivalent Class A shares outstanding and average equivalent Class B shares outstanding. Class Bshares are economically equivalent to one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of a Class A share. Average equivalent Class A sharesoutstanding represents average Class A shares outstanding plus one-fifteen-hundredth (1/1,500) of the average Class B sharesoutstanding. Average equivalent Class B shares outstanding represents average Class B shares outstanding plus 1,500 timesaverage Class A shares outstanding.Berkshire’s common stock repurchase program, as amended, permits Berkshire to repurchase shares any time thatWarren Buffett, Berkshire’s Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer, and Charlie Munger, Vice Chairman of theBoard, believe that the repurchase price is below Berkshire’s intrinsic value, conservatively determined. The programcontinues to allow share repurchases in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions and does not specify amaximum number of shares to be repurchased. However, repurchases will not be made if they would reduce the total value ofBerkshire’s consolidated cash, cash equivalents and U.S. Treasury Bill holdings below $30 billion. The repurchase programdoes not obligate Berkshire to repurchase any specific dollar amount or number of Class A or Class B shares and there is noexpiration date to the program.\fK-105Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(22)Revenues from contracts with customersWe recognize revenue when a good or service is transferred to a customer. A good or service is transferred when or asthe customer obtains control of that good or service. Revenues are based on the consideration we expect to receive inconnection with our promises to deliver goods and services to our customers. The following tables summarize customercontract revenues disaggregated by reportable segment and the source of the revenue for each of the three years endedDecember 31, 2021 (in millions). Other revenues, which are not considered to be revenues from contracts with customersunder GAAP, are primarily insurance premiums earned, interest, dividend and other investment income and leasing revenues.2021ManufacturingMcLaneService andretailingBNSFBerkshireHathawayEnergyInsurance,Corporateand otherTotalManufactured products:Industrial and commercial products$22,184 $— $159 $— $— $— $ 22,343Building products19,604—————19,604Consumer products18,540—————18,540Grocery and convenience store distribution—31,245————31,245Food and beverage distribution—17,332————17,332Auto sales——9,966———9,966Other retail and wholesale distribution2,997—15,898———18,895Service1,4867514,12323,1205,583—35,063Electricity and natural gas————18,264—18,264Total64,81149,32830,14623,12023,847—191,252Other revenues3,7661224,601571,09675,20084,842$68,577 $ 49,450 $ 34,747 $ 23,177 $ 24,943 $ 75,200 $276,0942020Manufactured products:Industrial and commercial products$ 20,772$—$192$—$—$—$ 20,964Building products15,943—————15,943Consumer products14,757—————14,757Grocery and convenience store distribution—30,795————30,795Food and beverage distribution—15,368————15,368Auto sales——8,258———8,258Other retail and wholesale distribution2,452—12,470———14,922Service1,4565843,33220,6934,595—30,660Electricity and natural gas————15,066—15,066Total55,38046,74724,25220,69319,661—166,733Other revenues3,598933,859571,35369,81778,777$ 58,978$ 46,840$ 28,111$ 20,750$ 21,014$ 69,817$245,5102019Manufactured products:Industrial and commercial products$ 25,311$—$184$—$—$—$ 25,495Building products15,620—————15,620Consumer products14,120—————14,120Grocery and convenience store distribution—33,057————33,057Food and beverage distribution—16,767————16,767Auto sales——8,481———8,481Other retail and wholesale distribution2,299—12,213———14,512Service1,6425394,06223,3024,096—33,641Electricity and natural gas————14,819—14,819Total58,99250,36324,94023,30218,915—176,512Other revenues3,632954,459551,18168,68278,104$ 62,624$ 50,458$ 29,399$ 23,357$ 20,096$ 68,682$254,616\fK-106Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(22)Revenues from contracts with customers (Continued)A summary of the transaction price allocated to the significant unsatisfied remaining performance obligations relatingto contracts with expected durations in excess of one year as of December 31, 2021 and the timing of when the performanceobligations are expected to be satisfied follows (in millions).Less than12 monthsGreater than12 monthsTotalElectricity and natural gas$2,607$21,038$23,645Other sales and service contracts1,4112,2363,647(23)Pension plansCertain of our subsidiaries sponsor defined benefit pension plans.

Plan assets are generally invested with thelong-term objective of producing earnings to adequately cover expected benefit obligations, while assuming a prudent levelof risk. Allocations may change due to changing market conditions and investment opportunities. The expected rates ofreturn on plan assets reflect subjective assessments of expected long-term investment returns. Generally, past investmentreturns are not given significant consideration when establishing assumptions for expected long-term rates of return on planassets. Actual experience will differ from the assumed rates of return.\fK-108Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements (Continued)(23)Pension plans (Continued)A reconciliation of the pre-tax accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) related to defined benefit pension plansfor each of the two years ending December 31, 2021 follows (in millions).20212020Balance beginning of year$(2,251)$(1,896)Amount included in net periodic pension expense170141Actuarial gains (losses) and other1,596(496)Balance end of year$(485)$(2,251)Several of our subsidiaries also sponsor defined contribution retirement plans, such as 401(k) or profit-sharing plans.Employee contributions are subject to regulatory limitations and the specific plan provisions.

Plaintiffs occasionally seek punitive or exemplary damages. We do not believe that such normal androutine litigation will have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations. Berkshire and certain of itssubsidiaries are also involved in other kinds of legal actions, some of which assert or may assert claims or seek to imposefines and penalties. We believe that any liability that may arise as a result of other pending legal actions will not have amaterial effect on our consolidated financial condition or results of operations.Our subsidiaries regularly make commitments in the ordinary course of business for the future purchase of goods andservices used in their businesses, which are not yet reflected in our Consolidated Financial Statements. The most significantof our long-term commitments relate to our railroad, utilities and energy businesses and our shared aircraft ownership andleasing business. As of December 31, 2021, estimated future payments under those arrangements were as follows: $8 billionin 2022, $4 billion in 2023, $3 billion in 2024, $2 billion in 2025, $2 billion in 2026 and $15 billion after 2026.As indicated in Note 5, we have an agreement to acquire an additional 41.4% ownership interest in Pilot in 2023. Atthat time, Pilot will become a consolidated subsidiary. Additionally, we may be obligated to acquire certain noncontrollinginterests in less-than-wholly-owned subsidiaries in the future, pursuant to the terms of agreements with the noncontrollingshareholders. The timing and the amount of any future payments that might be required to such noncontrolling shareholdersare contingent on future actions of the noncontrolling owners and the value of the interest being acquired. If we had acquiredthe additional interest in Pilot and all outstanding noncontrolling interests as of December 31, 2021, we estimate theaggregate cost of these acquisitions would approximate $11 billion.\fK-113Item 9.

The management of these actions is owned by Berkshire’s exceptional operating CEOs.Under their leadership, and with my support, many of Berkshire’s diverse businesses have developedsustainability frameworks and are independently disclosing environmental initiatives and data, such asgreenhouse gas (“GHG”) emissions.Berkshire Hathaway Energy (“BHE”) and Burlington Northern Santa Fe (“BNSF”) – two of Berkshire’sgiants – have long been engaged in delivering sustainable outcomes that benefit all constituencies includingcustomers, communities, state and federal governments and Berkshire’s shareholders. The two businessesgenerated aggregate net earnings of $10.0 billion in 2021 and their direct GHG emissions represent more than90% of Berkshire’s direct emissions – a huge margin. Other subsidiaries, of course, are important, but Berkshirewill have failed if BHE and BNSF do not achieve their GHG emissions reduction goals.Here are the annual GHG emissions from these two businesses:Annual GHG Emissions(million metric tons)CompanyBaseline20212030TargetBHE . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .79.963.539.9BNSF . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .18.615.813.098.579.352.9BHE has selected 2005 as its baseline for GHG emissions – a year many others in the utility industry utilize.BHE’s primary source of GHG emissions is the generation of electricity from power plants that are fueled bycoal and natural gas. BHE’s utilities work with their regulators to implement state policies that protect the energyand economic needs of its constituents. BHE cannot develop a renewable energy project or retire a coal plantwithout the support of regulators, who ensure that any action taken by BHE is made in the best interest ofcustomers.I am pleased to report that BHE’s ability to make significant investments in renewables has created theopportunity to actively reduce coal generation while maintaining reliability and keeping customer costs low inthe process.Specifically, BHE has become a leading force in wind, solar and transmission activity across much of theU.S. BHE, through its Iowa utility MidAmerican Energy, began construction of its first wind turbines in 2004,investing a little over $300 million in these assets. Today, MidAmerican has over 3,400 turbines in operation andhas invested $13.6 billion in wind production. This incredible expenditure helps MidAmerican to producerenewable energy equivalent to 88% of its Iowa customers’ annual energy needs. It is attracting new customerstoo – data center activity is growing exponentially throughout Iowa, driven by MidAmerican’s combination oflow cost and clean power. This is not the end of MidAmerican’s journey – just last month, the companyannounced plans for a new $3.9 billion wind and solar project, which will enable renewable generation in excessof its customers’ annual usage in Iowa by 2025.The commitment to renewables goes beyond Iowa. In addition to the $13.6 billion invested in wind atMidAmerican, BHE has invested $16.5 billion in other wind, solar and geothermal energy projects that itoperates and has financed an additional $6.9 billion for other operators.A-3\fWhile making these significant investments in renewables, BHE has retired 16 of its coal generation units.Looking ahead, BHE plans to retire an additional 16 coal units between 2022 and 2030 in a reliable and cost-effectivemanner for its customers, thereby achieving its 50% GHG emissions reduction target for 2030. Progress has beenconsistent with this objective.Simultaneously, BHE plans to invest billions of dollars in wind, solar and storage capacity, as well as invest innew transmission lines in the West – a story told in Berkshire’s 2020 annual report. These transmission linesconnect remote noncarbon resources to far-away population centers. As additional noncarbon generation isdeployed and transmission is expanded, BHE plans to retire all remaining coal units by 2049 and all natural gasunits by 2050, enabling it to achieve net zero GHG emissions.BHE routinely communicates in detail its approach to decarbonization, outlining its strategies and the capital itwill deploy to achieve this objective. BHE’s regulated U.S. utilities issue third-party debt as part of their capitalstructure. Consequently, BHE has made environmental disclosures every year for the past 15 years through investorpresentations. These documents are publicly available on BHE’s website.BNSF has selected 2018 as its GHG emissions baseline year, which is consistent with its largest peer in theWest. BNSF’s GHG emissions profile is comprised of the consumption of diesel fuel in its locomotives (accountingfor 80% of its baseline GHG emissions), the third-party production and transportation of those fuels and, to a lesserextent, the consumption of natural gas and electricity across its broader operations.BNSF is a common carrier railroad with a federal legal obligation to transport any commodity – including coaland hazardous materials – upon its customers’ request. Yet, the environmental impacts of the transportation of thesegoods are reduced thanks to BNSF’s focus on safety and efficiency. By nature, rail is the most environmentallyefficient mode of land-based transportation, moving its customers’ products more than three times as far as truckson a per ton mile basis. To build on this, BNSF has committed to and embraced a broader sustainability model,applying a science-based approach that will provide a 30% reduction in BNSF’s GHG emissions by 2030 asmeasured from its baseline. Progress has been consistent with this objective.More will follow. Berkshire’s railroad will continue its improvements in fuel efficiency and increase itsutilization of renewable diesel fuel. Long-term solutions, such as battery-electric and hydrogen locomotives, arealso being evaluated and field tested. When successful, these measures will lower BNSF’s GHG emissions andincrease its cost competitiveness. Sustainability is fundamental to BNSF’s value proposition.BHE and BNSF are not alone when it comes to these sustainability endeavors at Berkshire. Many subsidiarieshave also been responding to their customers’ varied needs by carrying out commitments to sustainable outcomesand communicating environmental information. Equally, these efforts make good business sense.For example, many consumers are interested in improved environmental outcomes for apparel products. As aresult, three of Berkshire’s manufacturing businesses that specialize in these products – Fruit of the Loom, BrooksSports and Garan – each disclose the environmental impacts of the products they sell and their plans to reduce thoseimpacts long term. Further, all three businesses have committed to 2030 GHG emissions reduction targets,consistent with the expectations of each customer base. This information can be found on their websites.Additionally, four manufacturing businesses across Berkshire’s industrial and building products groups –Lubrizol, Johns Manville, Acme Brick and Shaw Industries – disclose on their websites recent GHG emissions dataand other sustainability information that is most relevant to their customers and operations.Berkshire’s culture is strong, and its operating managers daily demonstrate ownership and accountability bybeing responsive to the needs of their customers. The managers of these subsidiaries will continue to own allbusiness decisions, including their approach to sustainability and related environmental outcomes. Berkshire’sbusinesses are exceptionally well positioned to deliver on ever-changing customer expectations regardingsustainability, in both resources and attitude, while also driving value for Berkshire’s shareholders. I am supportiveof these outlined objectives and fully committed to Berkshire’s ongoing journey of delivering sustainable solutions.February 26, 2022Gregory E. AbelVice Chairman – Non-Insurance OperationsA-4\fBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.PROPERTY/CASUALTY INSURANCE*Our property/casualty (“P/C”) insurance business has been the engine propelling Berkshire’s growth since 1967, the year we acquiredNational Indemnity and its sister company, National Fire & Marine, for $8.6 million. Today, National Indemnity is the largest P/C company inthe world as measured by net worth. Insurance is a business of promises, and Berkshire’s ability to honor its commitments is unmatched.One reason we were attracted to the P/C business was the industry’s business model: P/C insurers receive premiums upfront and payclaims later. In extreme cases, such as claims arising from exposure to asbestos, or severe workplace accidents, payments can stretch overmany decades.This collect-now, pay-later model leaves P/C companies holding large sums – money we call “float” – that will eventually go to others.Meanwhile, insurers get to invest this float for their own benefit. Though individual policies and claims come and go, the amount of float aninsurer holds usually remains fairly stable in relation to premium volume. Consequently, as our business grows, so does our float. And how ithas grown, as the following table shows:YearFloat (in millions)1970 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .$391980 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2371990 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1,6322000 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .27,8712010 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .65,8322018 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .122,7322019 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .129,423We may in time experience a decline in float. If so, the decline will be very gradual – at the outside no more than 3% in any year. Thenature of our insurance contracts is such that we can never be subject to immediate or near-term demands for sums that are of significance toour cash resources. That structure is by design and is a key component in the unequaled financial strength of our insurance companies. Thatstrength will never be compromised.If our premiums exceed the total of our expenses and eventual losses, our insurance operation registers an underwriting profit that adds tothe investment income the float produces. When such a profit is earned, we enjoy the use of free money – and, better yet, get paid for holdingit.For the P/C industry as a whole, the financial value of float is now far less than it was for many years. That’s because the standardinvestment strategy for almost all P/C companies is heavily – and properly – skewed toward high-grade bonds. Changes in interest ratestherefore matter enormously to these companies, and during the last decade the bond market has offered pathetically low rates.Consequently, insurers suffered, as year by year they were forced – by maturities or issuer-call provisions – to recycle their “old”investment portfolios into new holdings providing much lower yields. Where once these insurers could safely earn 5 cents or 6 cents on eachdollar of float, they now take in only 2 cents or 3 cents (or even less if their operations are concentrated in countries mired in the never-neverland of negative rates).Some insurers may try to mitigate their loss of revenue by buying lower-quality bonds or non-liquid “alternative” investments promisinghigher yields. But those are dangerous games and activities that most institutions are ill-equipped to play.Berkshire’s situation is more favorable than that of insurers in general. Most important, our unrivaled mountain of capital, abundance ofcash and a huge and diverse stream of non-insurance earnings allow us far more investment flexibility than is generally available to othercompanies in the industry. The many choices open to us are always advantageous – and sometimes have presented us with majoropportunities.Our P/C companies have meanwhile had an excellent underwriting record. Berkshire has now operated at an underwriting profit for 16 ofthe last 17 years, the exception being 2017, when our pre-tax loss was a whopping $3.2 billion. For the entire 17-year span, our pre-tax gaintotaled $27.5 billion, of which $400 million was recorded in 2019.That record is no accident: Disciplined risk evaluation is the daily focus of our insurance managers, who know that the rewards of floatcan be drowned by poor underwriting results. All insurers give that message lip service. At Berkshire it is a religion, Old Testament style.As I have repeatedly done in the past, I will emphasize now that happy outcomes in insurance are far from a sure thing: We will mostcertainly not have an underwriting profit in 16 of the next 17 years. Danger always lurks.Mistakes in assessing insurance risks can be huge and can take many years – even decades – to surface and ripen. (Think asbestos.) Amajor catastrophe that will dwarf hurricanes Katrina and Michael will occur – perhaps tomorrow, perhaps many decades from now. “The BigOne” may come from a traditional source, such as wind or earthquake, or it may be a total surprise involving, say, a cyber attack havingdisastrous consequences beyond anything insurers now contemplate. When such a mega-catastrophe strikes, Berkshire will get its share of thelosses and they will be big – very big. Unlike many other insurers, however, handling the loss will not come close to straining our resources,and we will be eager to add to our business the next day.* Reproduced from Berkshire Hathaway Inc. 2019 Annual ReportA-5\fBERKSHIRE HATHAWAY INC.OPERATING COMPANIESINSURANCE:EmployeesGEICO . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .41,005Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group . . . . . . . . .538General Re . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2,014Berkshire Hathaway Homestate Companies . . . . . . .1,149Berkshire Hathaway Specialty . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1,214Berkshire Hathaway GUARD Insurance Companies . .1,270MedPro Group Inc. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1,108MLMIC Insurance Companies . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .238National Indemnity Primary Group . . . . . . . . . . . . . .862United States Liability Insurance Companies . . . . . .1,055Central States Indemnity . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2750,480MANUFACTURING:Acme . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1,794Benjamin Moore . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2,042Brooks Sports . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .1,117Clayton Homes . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .20,830CTB . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2,685Duracell . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .2,975Fechheimer . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .426Forest River . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .13,457Fruit of the Loom . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .32,591Garan . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .3,899H.

CodeBERT learnsgeneral-purpose representations that supportdownstream NL-PL applications such as nat-ural language code search, code documen-tation generation, etc.We develop Code-BERT with Transformer-based neural architec-ture, and train it with a hybrid objective func-tion that incorporates the pre-training task ofreplaced token detection, which is to detectplausible alternatives sampled from generators.This enables us to utilize both “bimodal” dataof NL-PL pairs and “unimodal” data, wherethe former provides input tokens for modeltraining while the latter helps to learn bet-ter generators.We evaluate CodeBERT ontwo NL-PL applications by ﬁne-tuning modelparameters.Results show that CodeBERTachieves state-of-the-art performance on bothnatural language code search and code docu-mentation generation. Furthermore, to inves-tigate what type of knowledge is learned inCodeBERT, we construct a dataset for NL-PLprobing, and evaluate in a zero-shot settingwhere parameters of pre-trained models areﬁxed. Results show that CodeBERT performsbetter than previous pre-trained models on NL-PL probing.11IntroductionLarge pre-trained models such as ELMo (Peterset al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018), BERT(Devlin et al., 2018), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019)∗Work done while this author was an intern at MicrosoftResearch Asia.1All the codes and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERTand RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) have dramati-cally improved the state-of-the-art on a variety ofnatural language processing (NLP) tasks. Thesepre-trained models learn effective contextual repre-sentations from massive unlabeled text optimizedby self-supervised objectives, such as maskedlanguage modeling, which predicts the originalmasked word from an artiﬁcially masked inputsequence. The success of pre-trained models inNLP also drives a surge of multi-modal pre-trainedmodels, such as ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019) forlanguage-image and VideoBERT (Sun et al., 2019)for language-video, which are learned from bi-modal data such as language-image pairs with bi-modal self-supervised objectives.In this work, we present CodeBERT, a bimodalpre-trained model for natural language (NL) andprogramming language (PL) like Python, Java,JavaScript, etc. CodeBERT captures the seman-tic connection between natural language and pro-gramming language, and produces general-purposerepresentations that can broadly support NL-PLunderstanding tasks (e.g. natural language codesearch) and generation tasks (e.g. code documen-tation generation). It is developed with the multi-layer Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which isadopted in a majority of large pre-trained models.In order to make use of both bimodal instancesof NL-PL pairs and large amount of available uni-modal codes, we train CodeBERT with a hybridobjective function, including standard masked lan-guage modeling (Devlin et al., 2018) and replacedtoken detection (Clark et al., 2020), where uni-modal codes help to learn better generators forproducing better alternative tokens for the latterobjective.We train CodeBERT from Github code reposito-\f1537ries in 6 programming languages, where bimodaldatapoints are codes that pair with function-levelnatural language documentations (Husain et al.,2019). Training is conducted in a setting similarto that of multilingual BERT (Pires et al., 2019),in which case one pre-trained model is learned for6 programming languages with no explicit mark-ers used to denote the input programming lan-guage.We evaluate CodeBERT on two down-stream NL-PL tasks, including natural languagecode search and code documentation generation.Results show that ﬁne-tuning the parameters ofCodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art performanceon both tasks. To further investigate what type ofknowledge is learned in CodeBERT, we constructa dataset for NL-PL probing, and test CodeBERTin a zero-shot scenario, i.e. without ﬁne-tuning theparameters of CodeBERT. We ﬁnd that CodeBERTconsistently outperforms RoBERTa, a purely natu-ral language-based pre-trained model. The contri-butions of this work are as follows:• CodeBERT is the ﬁrst large NL-PL pre-trained model for multiple programming lan-guages.• Empirical results show that CodeBERT is ef-fective in both code search and code-to-textgeneration tasks.• We further created a dataset which is the ﬁrstone to investigate the probing ability of thecode-based pre-trained models.2Background2.1Pre-Trained Models in NLPLarge pre-trained models (Peters et al., 2018; Rad-ford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al.,2019; Liu et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019) havebrought dramatic empirical improvements on al-most every NLP task in the past few years. Suc-cessful approaches train deep neural networks onlarge-scale plain texts with self-supervised learningobjectives. One of the most representative neuralarchitectures is the Transformer (Vaswani et al.,2017), which is also the one used in this work. Itcontains multiple self-attention layers, and can beconventionally learned with gradient decent in anend-to-end manner as every component is differen-tiable. The terminology “self-supervised” meansthat supervisions used for pre-training are auto-matically collected from raw data without manualannotation. Dominant learning objectives are lan-guage modeling and its variations. For example,in GPT (Radford et al., 2018), the learning objec-tive is language modeling, namely predicting thenext word wk given the preceding context words{w1, w2, ..., wk−1}. As the ultimate goal of pre-training is not to train a good language model, it isdesirable to consider both preceding and followingcontexts to learn better general-purpose contextualrepresentations. This leads us to the masked lan-guage modeling objective used in BERT (Devlinet al., 2018), which learns to predict the maskedwords of a randomly masked word sequence givensurrounding contexts. Masked language modelingis also used as one of the two learning objectivesfor training CodeBERT.2.2Multi-Modal Pre-Trained ModelsThe remarkable success of the pre-trained modelin NLP has driven the development of multi-modalpre-trained model that learns implicit alignmentbetween inputs of different modalities. These mod-els are typically learned from bimodal data, suchas pairs of language-image or pairs of language-video. For example, ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019)learns from image caption data, where the modellearns by reconstructing categories of masked im-age region or masked words given the observedinputs, and meanwhile predicting whether the cap-tion describes the image content or not.Simi-larly, VideoBERT (Sun et al., 2019) learns fromlanguage-video data and is trained by video andtext masked token prediction. Our work belongsto this line of research as we regard NL and PLas different modalities. Our method differs fromprevious works in that the fuels for model train-ing include not only bimodal data of NL-PL pairs,but larger amounts of unimodal data such as codeswithout paired documentations.A concurrent work (Kanade et al., 2019) usesmasked language modeling and next sentence pre-diction as the objective to train a BERT model onPython source codes, where a sentence is a log-ical code line as deﬁned by the Python standard.In terms of the pre-training process, CodeBERTdiffers from their work in that (1) CodeBERT istrained in a cross-modal style and leverages bothbimodal NL-PL data and unimodal PL/NL data, (2)CodeBERT is pre-trained over six programminglanguages, and (3) CodeBERT is trained with anew learning objective based on replaced token\f1538detection.3CodeBERTWe describe the details about CodeBERT in thissection, including the model architecture, the inputand output representations, the objectives and dataused for training CodeBERT, and how to ﬁne-tuneCodeBERT when it is applied to downstream tasks.3.1Model ArchitectureWe follow BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) andRoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), and use multi-layerbidirectional Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) asthe model architecture of CodeBERT. We will notreview the ubiquitous Transformer architecture indetail. We develop CodeBERT by using exactly thesame model architecture as RoBERTa-base. Thetotal number of model parameters is 125M.3.2Input/Output RepresentationsIn the pre-training phase, we set the input as theconcatenation of two segments with a special sepa-rator token, namely [CLS], w1, w2, ..wn, [SEP],c1, c2, ..., cm, [EOS]. One segment is natural lan-guage text, and another is code from a certain pro-gramming language. [CLS] is a special token infront of the two segments, whose ﬁnal hidden repre-sentation is considered as the aggregated sequencerepresentation for classiﬁcation or ranking. Follow-ing the standard way of processing text in Trans-former, we regard a natural language text as a se-quence of words, and split it as WordPiece (Wuet al., 2016). We regard a piece of code as a se-quence of tokens.The output of CodeBERT includes (1) contextualvector representation of each token, for both naturallanguage and code, and (2) the representation of[CLS], which works as the aggregated sequencerepresentation.3.3Pre-Training DataWe train CodeBERT with both bimodal data, whichrefers to parallel data of natural language-codepairs, and unimodal data, which stands for codeswithout paired natural language texts and naturallanguage without paired codes.We use datapoints from Github repositories,where each bimodal datapoint is an individualfunction with paired documentation, and each uni-modal code is a function without paired documen-tation. Speciﬁcally, we use a recent large datasetTRAINING DATAbimodal DATAunimodal CODESGO319,256726,768JAVA500,7541,569,889JAVASCRIPT143,2521,857,835PHP662,907977,821PYTHON458,2191,156,085RUBY52,905164,048ALL2,137,2936,452,446Table 1: Statistics of the dataset used for training Code-BERT.provided by Husain et al. (2019), which includes2.1M bimodal datapoints and 6.4M unimodal codesacross six programming languages (Python, Java,JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Go). Data statistics isshown in Table 1.2The data comes from publicly available open-source non-fork GitHub repositories and are ﬁl-tered with a set of constraints and rules. For ex-ample, (1) each project should be used by at leastone other project, (2) each documentation is trun-cated to the ﬁrst paragraph, (3) documentationsshorter than three tokens are removed, (4) func-tions shorter than three lines are removed, and (5)function names with substring “test” are removed.An example of the data is given in Figure 1 3.Figure 1: An example of the NL-PL pair, where NL isthe ﬁrst paragraph (ﬁlled in red) from the documenta-tion (dashed line in black) of a function.3.4Pre-Training CodeBERTWe describe the two objectives used for trainingCodeBERT here. The ﬁrst objective is maskedlanguage modeling (MLM), which has proven ef-fective in literature (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al.,2Since we will evaluate on the natural language codesearch task, we only use the training data of Husain et al.(2019) to train CodeBERT with no access to the dev and test-ing data.3The source of the illustrating example comes fromhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/618d6bff71073c8c93501ab7392c3cc579730f0b/python/pyspark/rdd.py#L125-L138\f1539NL GeneratorNL-Code Discriminator[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑤𝑤2𝑤3𝑤4[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑤𝑤1𝑤2𝑤3𝑤4𝑤5[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑐𝑐5𝑐3𝑐4[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑐𝑐1𝑐2𝑐3𝑐4𝑐5𝑐6𝑐1𝑤51𝑤2𝑤3𝑤4𝑤5𝑐29𝑐5𝑐3𝑐4𝑐162𝑐1originalreplacedCode GeneratororiginaloriginaloriginalreplacedoriginaloriginaloriginaloriginalreplacedsamplesamplesamplesampleFigure 2: An illustration about the replaced token detection objective. Both NL and code generators are languagemodels, which generate plausible tokens for masked positions based on surrounding contexts. NL-Code discrimi-nator is the targeted pre-trained model, which is trained via detecting plausible alternatives tokens sampled fromNL and PL generators. NL-Code discriminator is used for producing general-purpose representations in the ﬁne-tuning step. Both NL and code generators are thrown out in the ﬁne-tuning step.2019; Sun et al., 2019). We apply masked languagemodeling on bimodal data of NL-PL pairs. The sec-ond objective is replaced token detection (RTD),which further uses a large amount of unimodal data,such as codes without paired natural language texts.Detailed hyper-parameters for model pre-trainingare given in Appendix B.1.Objective #1:Masked Language Modeling(MLM)Given a datapoint of NL-PL pair (x ={w, c}) as input, where w is a sequence of NLwords and c is a sequence of PL tokens, we ﬁrstselect a random set of positions for both NL and PLto mask out (i.e. mw and mc, respectively), andthen replace the selected positions with a special[MASK] token. Following Devlin et al. (2018),15% of the tokens from x are masked out.mwi ∼unif{1, |w|} for i = 1 to |w|(1)mci ∼unif{1, |c|} for i = 1 to |c|(2)wmasked = REPLACE(w, mw, [MASK])(3)cmasked = REPLACE(c, mc, [MASK])(4)x = w + c(5)The MLM objective is to predict the original to-kens which are masked out, formulated as follows,where pD1 is the discriminator which predicts atoken from a large vocabulary.LMLM(θ)=Xi∈mw∪mc−log pD1(xi|wmasked,cmasked)(6)Objective #2: Replaced Token Detection (RTD)In the MLM objective, only bimodal data (i.e. data-points of NL-PL pairs) is used for training. Here wepresent the objective of replaced token detection.The RTD objective (Clark et al., 2020) is origi-nally developed for efﬁciently learning pre-trainedmodel for natural language. We adapt it in our sce-nario, with the advantage of using both bimodaland unimodal data for training. Speciﬁcally, thereare two data generators here, an NL generator pGwand a PL generator pGc, both for generating plau-sible alternatives for the set of randomly maskedpositions.ˆwi ∼pGw(wi|wmasked) for i ∈mw(7)ˆci ∼pGc(ci|cmasked) for i ∈mc(8)wcorrupt = REPLACE(w, mw, ˆw)(9)ccorrupt = REPLACE(c, mc, ˆc)(10)xcorrupt = wcorrupt + ccorrupt(11)The discriminator is trained to determine whethera word is the original one or not, which is a binaryclassiﬁcation problem. It is worth noting that theRTD objective is applied to every position in theinput, and it differs from GAN (generative adver-sarial network) in that if a generator happens toproduce the correct token, the label of that tokenis “real” instead of “fake” (Clark et al., 2020). Theloss function of RTD with regard to the discrimina-tor parameterized by θ is given below, where δ(i) is\f1540an indicator function and pD2 is the discriminatorthat predicts the probability of the i-th word beingoriginal.LRTD(θ) =|w|+|c|Xi=1\u0012δ(i)log pD2(xcorrupt, i)+\u00101 −δ(i)\u0011\u00101 −log pD2(xcorrupt, i)\u0011\u0013(12)δ(i) =(1,if xcorrupti= xi.0,otherwise.(13)There are many different ways to implement thegenerators. In this work, we implement two ef-ﬁcient n-gram language models (Jurafsky, 2000)with bidirectional contexts, one for NL and onefor PL, and learn them from corresponding uni-model datapoints, respectively. The approach iseasily generalized to learn bimodal generators oruse more complicated generators like Transformer-based neural architecture learned in a joint manner.We leave these to future work. The PL training datais the unimodal codes as shown in Table 1, and theNL training data comes from the documentationsfrom bimodal data. One could easily extend thesetwo training datasets to larger amount. The ﬁnalloss function are given below.minθLMLM(θ) + LRTD(θ)(14)3.5Fine-Tuning CodeBERTWe have different settings to use CodeBERT indownstream NL-PL tasks. For example, in naturallanguage code search, we feed the input as thesame way as the pre-training phase and use therepresentation of [CLS] to measure the semanticrelevance between code and natural language query,while in code-to-text generation, we use an encoder-decoder framework and initialize the encoder ofa generative model with CodeBERT. Details aregiven in the experiment section.4ExperimentWe present empirical results in this section to verifythe effectiveness of CodeBERT. We ﬁrst describethe use of CodeBERT in natural language codesearch (§4.1), in a way that model parameters ofCodeBERT are ﬁne-tuned. After that, we presentthe NL-PL probing task (§4.2), and evaluate Code-BERT in a zero-shot setting where the parametersof CodeBERT are ﬁxed. Finally, we evaluate Code-BERT on a generation problem, i.e. code documen-tation generation (§4.3), and further evaluate on aprogramming language which is never seen in thetraining phase (§4.4).4.1Natural Language Code SearchGiven a natural language as the input, the objec-tive of code search is to ﬁnd the most semanticallyrelated code from a collection of codes. We con-duct experiments on the CodeSearchNet corpus(Husain et al., 2019) 4. We follow the ofﬁcial evalu-ation metric to calculate the Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR) for each pair of test data (c, w) over a ﬁxedset of 999 distractor codes. We further calculate themacro-average MRR for all languages as an overallevaluation metric. It is helpful to note that this met-ric differs from the AVG metric in the original pa-per, where the answer is retrieved from candidatesfrom all six languages. We ﬁne-tune a language-speciﬁc model for each programming language5.We train each model with a binary classiﬁcationloss function, where a softmax layer is connectedto the representation of [CLS]. Both training andvalidation datasets are created in a way that posi-tive and negative samples are balanced. Negativesamples consist of balanced number of instanceswith randomly replaced NL (i.e. (c, ˆw)) and PL(i.e. (ˆc, w)). Detailed hyper-parameters for modelﬁne-tuning are given in Appendix B.2.Model ComparisonsTable 2 shows the resultsof different approaches on the CodeSearchNet cor-pus. The ﬁrst four rows are reported by Husainet al. (2019), which are joint embeddings of NL andPL (Gu et al., 2018; Mitra et al., 2018). NBOWrepresents neural bag-of-words. CNN, BIRNNand SELFATT stand for 1D convolultional neu-ral network (Kim, 2014), bidirectional GRU-basedrecurrent neural network (Cho et al., 2014), andmulti-head attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), respec-tively.We report the remaining numbers in Table 2.We train all these pre-trained models by regardingcodes as a sequence of tokens. We also continu-ously train RoBERTa only on codes from Code-SearchNet with masked language modeling. Re-sults show that CodeBERT consistently performs4More details about the dataset are given in Appendix A.5We have ﬁne-tuned a multi-lingual model for six program-ming languages, but ﬁnd that it performs worse that ﬁne-tuninga language-speciﬁc model for each programming language.\f1541MODELRUBYJAVASCRIPTGOPYTHONJAVAPHPMA-AVGNBOW0.42850.46070.64090.58090.51400.48350.5181CNN0.24500.35230.62740.57080.52700.52940.4753BIRNN0.08350.15300.45240.32130.28650.25120.2580SELFATT0.36510.45060.68090.69220.58660.60110.5628ROBERTA0.62450.60600.82040.80870.66590.65760.6972PT W/ CODE ONLY (INIT=S)0.57120.55570.79290.78550.65670.61720.6632PT W/ CODE ONLY (INIT=R)0.66120.64020.81910.84380.72130.67060.7260CODEBERT (MLM, INIT=S)0.56950.60290.83040.82610.71420.65560.6998CODEBERT (MLM, INIT=R)0.68980.69970.83830.86470.74760.68930.7549CODEBERT (RTD, INIT=R)0.64140.65120.82850.82630.71500.67740.7233CODEBERT (MLM+RTD, INIT=R)0.69260.70590.84000.86850.74840.70620.7603Table 2: Results on natural language code retrieval. Baselines include four joint embeddings (ﬁrst group) of NLand PL, RoBERTa, and RoBERTa which is continuously trained with masked language modeling on codes only(second group). PT stands for pre-training. We train CodeBERT (third group) with different settings, includingusing different initialization (from scratch (INIT=S) or initialized with the parameters of RoBERTa (INIT=R)) andusing different learning objectives (MLM, RTD, or the combination of both).better than RoBERTa and the model pre-trainedwith code only. CodeBERT (MLM) learned fromscratch performs better than RoBERTa. Unsur-prisingly, initializing CodeBERT with RoBERTaimproves the performance 6.4.2NL-PL ProbingIn the previous subsection, we show the empiricaleffectiveness of CodeBERT in a setting that theparameters of CodeBERT are ﬁne-tuned in down-stream tasks. In this subsection, we further inves-tigate what type of knowledge is learned in Code-BERT without modifying the parameters.Task Formulation and Data ConstructionFol-lowing the probing experiments in NLP (Petroniet al., 2019; Talmor et al., 2019), we study NL-PL probing here. Since there is no existing worktowards this goal, we formulate the problem ofNL-PL probing and create the dataset by ourselves.Given an NL-PL pair (c, w), the goal of NL-PLprobing is to test model’s ability to correctly pre-dict/recover the masked token of interest (either acode token ci or word token wj) among distractors.There are two major types of distractors: one is thewhole target vocabulary used for the masked lan-guage modeling objective (Petroni et al., 2019), andanother one has fewer candidates which are ﬁlter orcurated based on experts’ understanding about theability to be tested (Talmor et al., 2019). We followthe second direction and formulate NL-PL probingas a multi-choice question answering task, wherethe question is cloze-style in which a certain token6We further give a learning curve of different pre-trainedmodels in the ﬁne-tuning process in Appendix C.is replaced by [MASK] and distractor candidateanswers are curated based on our expertise.Speciﬁcally, we evaluate on the NL side and PLside, respectively. To ease the effort of data col-lection, we collect data automatically from NL-PLpairs in both validation and testing sets of Code-SearchNet, both of which are unseen in the pre-training phase. To evaluate on the NL side, weselect NL-PL pairs whose NL documentations in-clude one of the six keywords (max, maximize, min,minimize, less, greater), and group them to fourcandidates by merging ﬁrst two keywords and themiddle two keywords. The task is to ask pre-trainedmodels to select the correct one instead of threeother distractors. That is to say, the input in thissetting includes the complete code and a maskedNL documentation. The goal is to select the correctanswer from four candidates. For the PL side, weselect codes containing keywords max and min, andformulate the task as a two-choice answer selectionproblem. Here, the input includes complete NLdocumentation and a masked PL code, and the goalis to select the correct answer from two candidates.Since code completion is an important scenario,we would like to test model’s ability in predictingthe correct token merely based on preceding PLcontexts. Therefore, we add an additional settingfor PL side, where the input includes the completeNL documentation and preceding PL codes. Datastatistics is given in the top two rows in Table 3.Model ComparisonsResults are given in Table3. We report accuracy, namely the number of cor-rectly predicted instances over the number of allinstances, for each programming language.

Accuracies(%) are reported. Best results in each group are in bold.datasets in different programming languages areextremely unbalanced, we report the accumulatedmetric with the same way. We use CodeBERT(MLM) here because its output layer naturally ﬁtsfor probing. Results show that CodeBERT per-forms better than baselines on almost all languageson both NL and PL probing. The numbers withonly preceding contexts are lower than that withbidirectional contexts, which suggests that codecompletion is challenging. We leave it as a futurework.We further give a case study on PL-NL probing.We mask NL token and PL token separately, andreport the predicted probabilities of RoBERTa andCodeBERT. Figure 3 illustrates the example of apython code7. We can see that RoBERTa fails inboth cases, whereas CodeBERT makes the correctprediction in both NL and PL settings.4.3Code Documentation GenerationAlthough the pre-training objective of Code-BERT does not include generation-based objectives(Lewis et al., 2019), we would like to investigateto what extent does CodeBERT perform on gen-eration tasks. Speciﬁcally, we study code-to-NLgeneration, and report results for the documenta-tion generation task on CodeSearchNet Corpus insix programming languages. Since the generateddocumentations are short and higher order n-gramsmay not overlap, we remedy this problem by usingsmoothed BLEU score (Lin and Och, 2004).7Theexamplecomesfromhttps://github.com/peri-source/peri/blob/61beed5deaaf978ab31ed716e8470d86ba639867/peri/comp/psfcalc.py#L994-L1002def vec_to_halfvec(vec):d = vec[1:] - vec[:-1]if ((d/d.mean()).std() > 1e-14) or (d.mean() < 0):raise ValueError('vec must be np.arange() in increasing order')dx = d.mean()lowest = np.abs(vec). min ()highest = np.abs(vec).max()return np.arange(lowest, highest + 0.1*dx, dx).astype(vec.dtype)\"Transforms a vector np.arange(-N, M, dx) to np.arange( min (|vec|), max(N,M),dx)]\"masked NL tokenmasked PL tokenmaxminlessgreaterNLRoberta96.24%3.73%0.02%0.01%CodeBERT (MLM)39.38%60.60%0.02%0.0003%PLRoberta95.85%4.15%--CodeBERT (MLM)0.001%99.999%--Figure 3: Case study on python language.

To this end, we study the task of gen-erating a natural language summary of a C# codesnippet. We conduct experiments on the datasetof CodeNN (Iyer et al., 2016)9, which consists of66,015 pairs of questions and answers automati-cally collected from StackOverﬂow. This datasetis challenging since the scale of dataset is ordersof magnitude smaller than CodeSearchNet Corpus.We evaluate models using smoothed BLEU-4 scoreand use the same evaluation scripts as Iyer et al.(2016).MODELBLEUMOSES (KOEHN ET AL., 2007)11.57IR13.66SUM-NN (RUSH ET AL., 2015)19.312-LAYER BILSTM19.78TRANSFORMER (VASWANI ET AL., 2017)19.68TREELSTM (TAI ET AL., 2015)20.11CODENN (IYER ET AL., 2016)20.53CODE2SEQ (ALON ET AL., 2019)23.04ROBERTA19.81PRE-TRAIN W/ CODE ONLY20.65CODEBERT (RTD)22.14CODEBERT (MLM)22.32CODEBERT (MLM+RTD)22.36Table 5: Code-to-NL generation on C# language.Model ComparisonsTable 5 shows that ourmodel with MLM and RTD pre-training objectivesachieves 22.36 BLEU score and improves by 2.55points over RoBERTa, which illustrates CodeBERT8We further give some output examples in Appendix E.9https://github.com/sriniiyer/codenncould generalize better to other programming lan-guage which is never seen in the pre-training step.However, our model achieve slightly lower resultsthan code2seq (Alon et al., 2019). The main reasoncould be that code2seq makes use of compositionalpaths in its abstract syntax tree (AST) while Code-BERT only takes original code as the input. Wehave trained a version of CodeBERT by traversingthe tree structure of AST following a certain order,but applying that model does not bring improve-ments on generation tasks. This shows a potentialdirection to improve CodeBERT by incorporatingAST.5ConclusionIn this paper, we present CodeBERT, which to thebest of our knowledge is the ﬁrst large bimodalpre-trained model for natural language and pro-gramming language. We train CodeBERT on bothbimodal and unimodal data, and show that ﬁne-tuning CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance on downstream tasks including natural lan-guage code search and code-to-documentation gen-eration. To further investigate the knowledge em-bodied in pre-trained models, we formulate the taskof NL-PL probing and create a dataset for probing.We regard the probing task as a cloze-style answerselection problem, and curate distractors for bothNL and PL parts. Results show that, with modelparameters ﬁxed, CodeBERT performs better thanRoBERTa and a continuously trained model usingcodes only.There are many potential directions for furtherresearch on this ﬁeld. First, one could learn bettergenerators with bimodal evidence or more compli-cated neural architecture to improve the replaced to-ken detection objective. Second, the loss functionsof CodeBERT mainly target on NL-PL understand-ing tasks. Although CodeBERT achieves strongBLEU scores on code-to-documentation genera-tion, the CodeBERT itself could be further im-proved by generation-related learning objectives.\f1544How to successfully incorporate AST into the pre-training step is also an attractive direction. Third,we plan to apply CodeBERT to more NL-PL re-lated tasks, and extend it to more programminglanguages. Flexible and powerful domain/languageadaptation methods are necessary to generalizewell.AcknowledgmentsXiaocheng Feng is the corresponding author of thiswork.

We apply CodeBERT fornatural language code search in a later fusion set-ting, where CodeBERT ﬁrst encodes NL and PLseparately, and then calculates the similarity by dot-product. In this way, code search is equivalent toﬁnd the nearest codes in the shared vector space.This scenario also facilitates the use of CodeBERTin an online system, where the representations ofcodes are calculated in advance.

Basedupon this understanding, we propose twoadditional pooling strategies over learnedword embeddings:(i) a max-poolingoperation for improved interpretability;and (ii) a hierarchical pooling operation,which preserves spatial (n-gram) informa-tion within text sequences.We presentexperiments on 17 datasets encompassingthree tasks: (i) (long) document classiﬁ-cation; (ii) text sequence matching; and(iii) short text tasks, including classiﬁca-tion and tagging.1IntroductionWord embeddings, learned from massive unstruc-tured text data, are widely-adopted building blocksfor Natural Language Processing (NLP). By rep-resenting each word as a ﬁxed-length vector,these embeddings can group semantically simi-lar words, while implicitly encoding rich linguis-tic regularities and patterns (Bengio et al., 2003;Mikolov et al., 2013; Pennington et al., 2014).Leveraging the word-embedding construct, manydeep architectures have been proposed to modelthe compositionality in variable-length text se-quences. These methods range from simple op-erations like addition (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010;Iyyer et al., 2015), to more sophisticated compo-sitional functions such as Recurrent Neural Net-works (RNNs) (Tai et al., 2015; Sutskever et al.,2014), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)(Kalchbrenner et al., 2014; Kim, 2014; Zhanget al., 2017a) and Recursive Neural Networks(Socher et al., 2011a).Models with more expressive compositionalfunctions, e.g., RNNs or CNNs, have demon-strated impressive results; however, they are typ-ically computationally expensive, due to the needto estimate hundreds of thousands, if not millions,of parameters (Parikh et al., 2016). In contrast,models with simple compositional functions oftencompute a sentence or document embedding bysimply adding, or averaging, over the word em-bedding of each sequence element obtained via,e.g., word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013), or GloVe(Pennington et al., 2014). Generally, such a Sim-ple Word-Embedding-based Model (SWEM) doesnot explicitly account for spatial, word-order in-formation within a text sequence. However, theypossess the desirable property of having signif-icantly fewer parameters, enjoying much fastertraining, relative to RNN- or CNN-based models.Hence, there is a computation-vs.-expressivenesstradeoff regarding how to model the composition-ality of a text sequence.In this paper, we conduct an extensive experi-mental investigation to understand when, and why,simple pooling strategies, operated over word em-beddings alone, already carry sufﬁcient informa-tion for natural language understanding. To ac-count for the distinct nature of various NLP tasksthat may require different semantic features, we\f441compare SWEM-based models with existing re-current and convolutional networks in a point-by-point manner.Speciﬁcally, we consider 17datasets, including three distinct NLP tasks: doc-ument classiﬁcation (Yahoo news, Yelp reviews,etc.), natural language sequence matching (SNLI,WikiQA, etc.)and (short) sentence classiﬁca-tion/tagging (Stanford sentiment treebank, TREC,etc.). Surprisingly, SWEMs exhibit comparable oreven superior performance in the majority of casesconsidered.In order to validate our experimental ﬁndings,we conduct additional investigations to understandto what extent the word-order information is uti-lized/required to make predictions on differenttasks. We observe that in text representation tasks,many words (e.g., stop words, or words that arenot related to sentiment or topic) do not meaning-fully contribute to the ﬁnal predictions (e.g., sen-timent label). Based upon this understanding, wepropose to leverage a max-pooling operation di-rectly over the word embedding matrix of a givensequence, to select its most salient features. Thisstrategy is demonstrated to extract complementaryfeatures relative to the standard averaging opera-tion, while resulting in a more interpretable model.Inspired by a case study on sentiment analysistasks, we further propose a hierarchical poolingstrategy to abstract and preserve the spatial infor-mation in the ﬁnal representations. This strategyis demonstrated to exhibit comparable empiricalresults to LSTM and CNN on tasks that are sensi-tive to word-order features, while maintaining thefavorable properties of not having compositionalparameters, thus fast training.Our work presents a simple yet strong base-line for text representation learning that is widelyignored in benchmarks, and highlights the gen-eral computation-vs.-expressiveness tradeoff asso-ciated with appropriately selecting compositionalfunctions for distinct NLP problems. Furthermore,we quantitatively show that the word-embedding-based text classiﬁcation tasks can have the similarlevel of difﬁculty regardless of the employed mod-els, using the subspace training (Li et al., 2018) toconstrain the trainable parameters. Thus, accord-ing to Occam’s razor, simple models are preferred.2Related WorkA fundamental goal in NLP is to develop expres-sive, yet computationally efﬁcient compositionalfunctions that can capture the linguistic structureof natural language sequences. Recently, severalstudies have suggested that on certain NLP ap-plications, much simpler word-embedding-basedarchitectures exhibit comparable or even superiorperformance, compared with more-sophisticatedmodels using recurrence or convolutions (Parikhet al., 2016; Vaswani et al., 2017).Althoughcomplex compositional functions are avoided inthese models, additional modules, such as atten-tion layers, are employed on top of the word em-bedding layer. As a result, the speciﬁc role thatthe word embedding plays in these models is notemphasized (or explicit), which distracts from un-derstanding how important the word embeddingsalone are to the observed superior performance.Moreover, several recent studies have shown em-pirically that the advantages of distinct composi-tional functions are highly dependent on the spe-ciﬁc task (Mitchell and Lapata, 2010; Iyyer et al.,2015; Zhang et al., 2015a; Wieting et al., 2015;Arora et al., 2016). Therefore, it is of interest tostudy the practical value of the additional expres-siveness, on a wide variety of NLP problems.SWEMs bear close resemblance to Deep Aver-aging Network (DAN) (Iyyer et al., 2015) or fast-Text (Joulin et al., 2016), where they show thataverage pooling achieves promising results on cer-tain NLP tasks. However, there exist several keydifferences that make our work unique. First, weexplore a series of pooling operations, rather thanonly average-pooling.Speciﬁcally, a hierarchi-cal pooling operation is introduced to incorporatespatial information, which demonstrates superiorresults on sentiment analysis, relative to averagepooling. Second, our work not only explores whensimple pooling operations are enough, but also in-vestigates the underlying reasons, i.e., what se-mantic features are required for distinct NLP prob-lems. Third, DAN and fastText only focused onone or two problems at a time, thus a compre-hensive study regarding the effectiveness of vari-ous compositional functions on distinct NLP tasks,e.g., categorizing short sentence/long documents,matching natural language sentences, has hereto-fore been absent.In response, our work seeksto perform a comprehensive comparison with re-spect to simple-vs.-complex compositional func-tions, across a wide range of NLP problems, andreveals some general rules for rationally selectingmodels to tackle different tasks.\f4423Models & trainingConsider a text sequence represented as X (ei-ther a sentence or a document), composed of a se-quence of words: {w1, w2, ...., wL}, where L isthe number of tokens, i.e., the sentence/documentlength. Let {v1, v2, ...., vL} denote the respectiveword embeddings for each token, where vl 2 RK.The compositional function, X ! z, aims tocombine word embeddings into a ﬁxed-length sen-tence/document representation z. These represen-tations are then used to make predictions about se-quence X. Below, we describe different types offunctions considered in this work.3.1Recurrent Sequence EncoderA widely adopted compositional function is de-ﬁned in a recurrent manner: the model succes-sively takes word vector vt at position t, alongwith the hidden unit ht−1 from the last positiont −1, to update the current hidden unit via ht =f(vt, ht−1), where f(·) is the transition function.To address the issue of learning long-term de-pendencies, f(·) is often deﬁned as Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) (Hochreiter and Schmid-huber, 1997), which employs gates to control theﬂow of information abstracted from a sequence.We omit the details of the LSTM and refer the in-terested readers to the work by Graves et al. (2013)for further explanation. Intuitively, the LSTM en-codes a text sequence considering its word-orderinformation, but yields additional compositionalparameters that must be learned.3.2Convolutional Sequence EncoderThe Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) archi-tecture (Kim, 2014; Collobert et al., 2011; Ganet al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017b; Shen et al.,2018) is another strategy extensively employedas the compositional function to encode text se-quences.The convolution operation considerswindows of n consecutive words within the se-quence, where a set of ﬁlters (to be learned) areapplied to these word windows to generate corre-sponding feature maps. Subsequently, an aggre-gation operation (such as max-pooling) is used ontop of the feature maps to abstract the most salientsemantic features, resulting in the ﬁnal representa-tion. For most experiments, we consider a single-layer CNN text model. However, Deep CNN textmodels have also been developed (Conneau et al.,2016), and are considered in a few of our experi-ments.3.3Simple Word-Embedding Model(SWEM)To investigate the raw modeling capacity of wordembeddings, we consider a class of models withno additional compositional parameters to en-code natural language sequences, termed SWEMs.Among them, the simplest strategy is to computethe element-wise average over word vectors for agiven sequence (Wieting et al., 2015; Adi et al.,2016):z = 1LLXi=1vi .(1)The model in (1) can be seen as an average pool-ing operation, which takes the mean over each ofthe K dimensions for all word embeddings, result-ing in a representation z with the same dimensionas the embedding itself, termed here SWEM-aver.Intuitively, z takes the information of every se-quence element into account via the addition op-eration.Max PoolingMotivated by the observation that,in general, only a small number of key words con-tribute to ﬁnal predictions, we propose anotherSWEM variant, that extracts the most salient fea-tures from every word-embedding dimension, bytaking the maximum value along each dimensionof the word vectors. This strategy is similar to themax-over-time pooling operation in convolutionalneural networks (Collobert et al., 2011):z = Max-pooling(v1, v2, ..., vL) .(2)We denote this model variant as SWEM-max.Here the j-th component of z is the maximumelement in the set {v1j, . . . , vLj}, where v1j is,for example, the j-th component of v1. With thispooling operation, those words that are unimpor-tant or unrelated to the corresponding tasks willbe ignored in the encoding process (as the com-ponents of the embedding vectors will have smallamplitude), unlike SWEM-aver where every wordcontributes equally to the representation.Considering that SWEM-aver and SWEM-maxare complementary, in the sense of accounting fordifferent types of information from text sequences,we also propose a third SWEM variant, where thetwo abstracted features are concatenated togetherto form the sentence embeddings, denoted hereas SWEM-concat. For all SWEM variants, thereare no additional compositional parameters to be\f443ModelParametersComplexitySequential OpsCNNn · K · dO(n · L · K · d)O(1)LSTM4 · d · (K + d)O(L · d2 + L · K · d)O(L)SWEM0O(L · K)O(1)Table 1: Comparisons of CNN, LSTM and SWEMarchitectures. Columns correspond to the numberof compositional parameters, computational com-plexity and sequential operations, respectively.learned. As a result, the models only exploit intrin-sic word embedding information for predictions.Hierarchical PoolingBoth SWEM-aver andSWEM-max do not take word-order or spatial in-formation into consideration, which could be use-ful for certain NLP applications. So motivated, wefurther propose a hierarchical pooling layer. Letvi:i+n−1 refer to the local window consisting ofn consecutive words words, vi, vi+1, ..., vi+n−1.First, an average-pooling is performed on eachlocal window, vi:i+n−1.The extracted featuresfrom all windows are further down-sampled witha global max-pooling operation on top of the rep-resentations for every window. We call this ap-proach SWEM-hier due to its layered pooling.This strategy preserves the local spatial infor-mation of a text sequence in the sense that it keepstrack of how the sentence/document is constructedfrom individual word windows, i.e., n-grams. Thisformulation is related to bag-of-n-grams method(Zhang et al., 2015b).However, SWEM-hierlearns ﬁxed-length representations for the n-gramsthat appear in the corpus, rather than just capturingtheir occurrences via count features, which maypotentially advantageous for prediction purposes.3.4Parameters & Computation ComparisonWe compare CNN, LSTM and SWEM wrt theirparameters and computational speed. K denotesthe dimension of word embeddings, as above. Forthe CNN, we use n to denote the ﬁlter width (as-sumed constant for all ﬁlters, for simplicity ofanalysis, but in practice variable n is commonlyused). We deﬁne d as the dimension of the ﬁnalsequence representation. Speciﬁcally, d representsthe dimension of hidden units or the number of ﬁl-ters in LSTM or CNN, respectively.We ﬁrst examine the number of compositionalparameters for each model. As shown in Table 1,both the CNN and LSTM have a large number ofparameters, to model the semantic compositional-ity of text sequences, whereas SWEM has no suchparameters. Similar to Vaswani et al. (2017), wethen consider the computational complexity andthe minimum number of sequential operations re-quired for each model. SWEM tends to be moreefﬁcient than CNN and LSTM in terms of compu-tation complexity. For example, considering thecase where K = d, SWEM is faster than CNN orLSTM by a factor of nd or d, respectively. Further,the computations in SWEM are highly paralleliz-able, unlike LSTM that requires O(L) sequentialsteps.4ExperimentsWe evaluate different compositional functions ona wide variety of supervised tasks, includingdocument categorization, text sequence matching(given a sentence pair, X1, X2, predict their re-lationship, y) as well as (short) sentence classiﬁ-cation. We experiment on 17 datasets concerningnatural language understanding, with correspond-ing data statistics summarized in the Supplemen-tary Material. Our code will be released to encour-age future research.We use GloVe word embeddings with K = 300(Pennington et al., 2014) as initialization for allour models. Out-Of-Vocabulary (OOV) words areinitialized from a uniform distribution with range[−0.01, 0.01].The GloVe embeddings are em-ployed in two ways to learn reﬁned word em-beddings: (i) directly updating each word em-bedding during training; and (ii) training a 300-dimensional Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) layerwith ReLU activation, with GloVe embeddings asinput to the MLP and with output deﬁning the re-ﬁned word embeddings. The latter approach cor-responds to learning an MLP model that adaptsGloVe embeddings to the dataset and task of in-terest. The advantages of these two methods dif-fer from dataset to dataset. We choose the bet-ter strategy based on their corresponding perfor-mances on the validation set. The ﬁnal classiﬁer isimplemented as an MLP layer with dimension se-lected from the set [100, 300, 500, 1000], followedby a sigmoid or softmax function, depending onthe speciﬁc task.Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014) is used to opti-mize all models, with learning rate selected fromthe set [1 ⇥10−3, 3 ⇥10−4, 2 ⇥10−4, 1 ⇥10−5](with cross-validation used to select the appro-priate parameter for a given dataset and task).Dropout regularization (Srivastava et al., 2014) is\f444ModelYahoo!

The batch size is selected from[2, 8, 32, 128, 512].4.1Document CategorizationWe begin with the task of categorizing documents(with approximately 100 words in average perdocument). We follow the data split in Zhang et al.(2015b) for comparability.These datasets canbe generally categorized into three types: topiccategorization (represented by Yahoo!Answerand AG news), sentiment analysis (represented byYelp Polarity and Yelp Full) and ontology clas-siﬁcation (represented by DBpedia). Results areshown in Table 2. Surprisingly, on topic predictiontasks, our SWEM model exhibits stronger perfor-mances, relative to both LSTM and CNN compo-sitional architectures, this by leveraging both theaverage and max-pooling features from word em-beddings. Speciﬁcally, our SWEM-concat modeleven outperforms a 29-layer deep CNN model(Conneau et al., 2016), when predicting topics.On the ontology classiﬁcation problem (DBpediadataset), we observe the same trend, that SWEMexhibits comparable or even superior results, rela-tive to CNN or LSTM models.Since there are no compositional parametersin SWEM, our models have an order of mag-nitude fewer parameters (excluding embeddings)than LSTM or CNN, and are considerably morecomputationally efﬁcient.As illustrated in Ta-ble 4, SWEM-concat achieves better results onYahoo! Answer than CNN/LSTM, with only 61Kparameters (one-tenth the number of LSTM pa-rameters, or one-third the number of CNN param-eters), while taking a fraction of the training timerelative to the CNN or LSTM.ModelParametersSpeedCNN541K171sLSTM1.8M598sSWEM61K63sTable 4: Speed & Parameters on Yahoo! Answerdataset.Interestingly, for the sentiment analysis tasks,both CNN and LSTM compositional functionsperform better than SWEM, suggesting that word-order information may be required for analyzingsentiment orientations.This ﬁnding is consis-tent with Pang et al. (2002), where they hypoth-esize that the positional information of a word intext sequences may be beneﬁcial to predict sen-timent.This is intuitively reasonable since, forinstance, the phrase “not really good” and “re-ally not good” convey different levels of nega-tive sentiment, while being different only by theirword orderings. Contrary to SWEM, CNN and\f445LSTM models can both capture this type of infor-mation via convolutional ﬁlters or recurrent transi-tion functions. However, as suggested above, suchword-order patterns may be much less useful forpredicting the topic of a document. This may beattributed to the fact that word embeddings alonealready provide sufﬁcient topic information of adocument, at least when the text sequences con-sidered are relatively long.4.1.1Interpreting model predictionsAlthough the proposed SWEM-max variant gener-ally performs a slightly worse than SWEM-aver,it extracts complementary features from SWEM-aver, and hence in most cases SWEM-concat ex-hibits the best performance among all SWEMvariants.More importantly, we found that theword embeddings learned from SWEM-max tendto be sparse. We trained our SWEM-max modelon the Yahoo datasets (randomly initialized). Withthe learned embeddings, we plot the values foreach of the word embedding dimensions, for theentire vocabulary.As shown in Figure 1, mostof the values are highly concentrated around zero,indicating that the word embeddings learned arevery sparse.On the contrary, the GloVe wordembeddings, for the same vocabulary, are consid-erably denser than the embeddings learned fromSWEM-max. This suggests that the model mayonly depend on a few key words, among the en-tire vocabulary, for predictions (since most wordsdo not contribute to the max-pooling operation inSWEM-max). Through the embedding, the modellearns the important words for a given task (thosewords with non-zero embedding components).Figure 1:Histograms for learned word em-beddings (randomly initialized) of SWEM-maxand GloVe embeddings for the same vocabulary,trained on the Yahoo! Answer dataset.In this regard, the nature of max-pooling pro-cess gives rise to a more interpretable model. Fora document, only the word with largest value ineach embedding dimension is employed for the ﬁ-nal representation. Thus, we suspect that semanti-cally similar words may have large values in someshared dimensions. So motivated, after trainingthe SWEM-max model on the Yahoo dataset, weselected ﬁve words with the largest values, amongthe entire vocabulary, for each word embeddingdimension (these words are selected preferentiallyin the corresponding dimension, by the max op-eration). As shown in Table 3, the words chosenwrt each embedding dimension are indeed highlyrelevant and correspond to a common topic (thetopics are inferred from words). For example, thewords in the ﬁrst column of Table 3 are all po-litical terms, which could be assigned to the Pol-itics & Government topic. Note that our modelcan even learn locally interpretable structure thatis not explicitly indicated by the label informa-tion. For instance, all words in the ﬁfth columnare Chemistry-related. However, we do not have achemistry label in the dataset, and regardless theyshould belong to the Science topic.4.2Text Sequence MatchingTo gain a deeper understanding regarding the mod-eling capacity of word embeddings, we further in-vestigate the problem of sentence matching, in-cluding natural language inference, answer sen-tence selection and paraphrase identiﬁcation. Thecorresponding performance metrics are shown inTable 5. Surprisingly, on most of the datasets con-sidered (except WikiQA), SWEM demonstratesthe best results compared with those with CNNor the LSTM encoder. Notably, on SNLI dataset,we observe that SWEM-max performs the bestamong all SWEM variants, consistent with theﬁndings in Nie and Bansal (2017); Conneau et al.(2017), that max-pooling over BiLSTM hiddenunits outperforms average pooling operation onSNLI dataset. As a result, with only 120K param-eters, our SWEM-max achieves a test accuracy of83.8%, which is very competitive among state-of-the-art sentence encoding-based models (in termsof both performance and number of parameters)1.The strong results of the SWEM approach onthese tasks may stem from the fact that whenmatching natural language sentences, it is sufﬁ-cient in most cases to simply model the word-level1See leaderboard at https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/snli/ for details.\f446MultiNLIModelSNLIMatchedMismatchedWikiQAQuoraMSRPAcc.Acc.Acc.MAPMRRAcc.Acc.F1CNN82.165.065.30.67520.689079.6069.980.9LSTM80.666.9⇤66.9⇤0.68200.698882.5870.680.5SWEM-aver82.366.566.20.68080.692282.6871.081.1SWEM-max83.868.267.70.66130.671782.2070.680.8SWEM-concat83.367.967.60.67880.690883.0371.581.3Table 5: Performance of different models on matching natural language sentences.

For MSRP dataset, we follow the setupin Hu et al. (2014) and do not use any additional features.alignments between two sequences (Parikh et al.,2016). From this perspective, word-order informa-tion becomes much less useful for predicting rela-tionship between sentences. Moreover, consider-ing the simpler model architecture of SWEM, theycould be much easier to be optimized than LSTMor CNN-based models, and thus give rise to betterempirical results.4.2.1Importance of word-order informationOne possible disadvantage of SWEM is that it ig-nores the word-order information within a text se-quence, which could be potentially captured byCNN- or LSTM-based models. However, we em-pirically found that except for sentiment analysis,SWEM exhibits similar or even superior perfor-mance as the CNN or LSTM on a variety of tasks.In this regard, one natural question would be: howimportant are word-order features for these tasks?To this end, we randomly shufﬂe the words forevery sentence in the training set, while keepingthe original word order for samples in the test set.The motivation here is to remove the word-orderfeatures from the training set and examine howsensitive the performance on different tasks areto word-order information. We use LSTM as themodel for this purpose since it can captures word-order information from the original training set.DatasetsYahooYelp P.SNLIOriginal72.7895.1178.02Shufﬂed72.8993.4977.68Table 6: Test accuracy for LSTM model trained onoriginal/shufﬂed training set.The results on three distinct tasks are shown inTable 6. Somewhat surprisingly, for Yahoo andSNLI datasets, the LSTM model trained on shuf-ﬂed training set shows comparable accuracies tothose trained on the original dataset, indicatingNegative:Friendly staff and nice selection of vegetar-ian options.

I wasparticularly excited to ﬁnd middle easternchili sauce and chocolate covered turkishdelights.Table 7: Test samples from Yelp Polarity datasetfor which LSTM gives wrong predictions withshufﬂed training data, but predicts correctly withthe original training set.that word-order information does not contributesigniﬁcantly on these two problems, i.e., topic cat-egorization and textual entailment. However, onthe Yelp polarity dataset, the results drop notice-ably, further suggesting that word-order does mat-ter for sentiment analysis (as indicated above froma different perspective).Notably, the performance of LSTM on the Yelpdataset with a shufﬂed training set is very close toour results with SWEM, indicating that the maindifference between LSTM and SWEM may be dueto the ability of the former to capture word-orderfeatures. Both observations are in consistent withour experimental results in the previous section.Case StudyTo understand what type of sen-tences are sensitive to word-order information, wefurther show those samples that are wrongly pre-dicted because of the shufﬂing of training data inTable 7. Taking the ﬁrst sentence as an example,several words in the review are generally positive,i.e. friendly, nice, okay, great and likes. However,the most vital features for predicting the sentimentof this sentence could be the phrase/sentence ‘isjust okay’, ‘not great’ or ‘makes me wonder whyeveryone likes’, which cannot be captured without\f447ModelMRSST-1SST-2SubjTRECRAE (Socher et al., 2011b)77.743.282.4––MV-RNN (Socher et al., 2012)79.044.482.9––LSTM (Tai et al., 2015)–46.484.9––RNN (Zhao et al., 2015)77.2––93.790.2Constituency Tree-LSTM (Tai et al., 2015)-51.088.0--Dynamic CNN (Kalchbrenner et al., 2014)–48.586.8–93.0CNN (Kim, 2014)81.548.088.193.493.6DAN-ROOT (Iyyer et al., 2015)-46.985.7--SWEM-aver77.645.283.992.592.2SWEM-max76.944.183.691.289.0SWEM-concat78.246.184.393.091.8Table 8: Test accuracies with different compositional functions on (short) sentence classiﬁcations.considering word-order features. It is worth notingthe hints for predictions in this case are actually n-gram phrases from the input document.4.3SWEM-hier for sentiment analysisAs demonstrated in Section 4.2.1, word-order in-formation plays a vital role for sentiment analysistasks. However, according to the case study above,the most important features for sentiment predic-tion may be some key n-gram phrase/words fromthe input document. We hypothesize that incor-porating information about the local word-order,i.e., n-gram features, is likely to largely mitigatethe limitations of the above three SWEM variants.Inspired by this observation, we propose using an-other simple pooling operation termed as hierar-chical (SWEM-hier), as detailed in Section 3.3.We evaluate this method on the two document-level sentiment analysis tasks and the results areshown in the last row of Table 2.SWEM-hier greatly outperforms the other threeSWEM variants, and the corresponding accuraciesare comparable to the results of CNN or LSTM(Table 2).This indicates that the proposed hi-erarchical pooling operation manages to abstractspatial (word-order) information from the inputsequence, which is beneﬁcial for performance insentiment analysis tasks.4.4Short Sentence ProcessingWe now consider sentence-classiﬁcation tasks(withapproximately20wordsonaverage).We experiment on three sentiment classiﬁcationdatasets, i.e., MR, SST-1, SST-2, as well as subjec-tivity classiﬁcation (Subj) and question classiﬁca-tion (TREC). The corresponding results are shownin Table 8.Compared with CNN/LSTM com-positional functions, SWEM yields inferior accu-racies on sentiment analysis datasets, consistentwith our observation in the case of document cat-egorization. However, SWEM exhibits compara-ble performance on the other two tasks, again withmuch less parameters and faster training. Further,we investigate two sequence tagging tasks: thestandard CoNLL2000 chunking and CoNLL2003NER datasets. Results are shown in the Supple-mentary Material, where LSTM and CNN againperform better than SWEMs. Generally, SWEMis less effective at extracting representations fromshort sentences than from long documents. Thismay be due to the fact that for a shorter text se-quence, word-order features tend to be more im-portant since the semantic information providedby word embeddings alone is relatively limited.Moreover, we note that the results on these rela-tively small datasets are highly sensitive to modelregularization techniques due to the overﬁtting is-sues.In this regard, one interesting future di-rection may be to develop speciﬁc regularizationstrategies for the SWEM framework, and thusmake them work better on small sentence classi-ﬁcation datasets.5Discussion5.1Comparison via subspace trainingWe use subspace training (Li et al., 2018) to mea-sure the model complexity in text classiﬁcationproblems.It constrains the optimization of thetrainable parameters in a subspace of low dimen-sion d, the intrinsic dimension dint deﬁnes theminimum d that yield a good solution. Two mod-els are studied: the SWEM-max variant, and theCNN model including a convolutional layer fol-lowed by a FC layer. We consider two settings:(1) The word embeddings are randomly intial-ized, and optimized jointly with the model param-eters. We show the performance of direct and sub-space training on AG News dataset in Figure 2(a)(b). The two models trained via direct methodshare almost identical perfomrnace on training and\f4480246810Subspace dim d0.9000.9250.9500.9751.000AccuracySWEMCNNSWEM directCNN direct0246810Subspace dim d0.880.890.900.910.92AccuracySWEMCNNSWEM directCNN direct(a) Training on AG News (b) Testing on AG News02004006008001000Subspace dim d0.50.60.70.80.9AccuracySWEMCNNSWEM directCNN direct02004006008001000Subspace dim d0.50.60.70.80.9AccuracySWEMCNNSWEM directCNN direct(c) Testing on AG News(d)Testing on Yelp P.Figure 2: Performance of subspace training. Wordembeddings are optimized in (a)(b), and frozen in(c)(d).testing. The subspace training yields similar ac-curacy with direct training for very small d, evenwhen model parameters are not trained at all (d =0).This is because the word embeddings havethe full degrees of freedom to adjust to achievegood solutions, regardless of the employed mod-els. SWEM seems to have an easier loss landspacethan CNN for word embeddings to ﬁnd the best so-lutions. According to Occam’s razor, simple mod-els are preferred, if all else are the same.(2) The pre-trained GloVe are frozen for theword embeddings, and only the model parametersare optimized. The results on testing datasets ofAG News and Yelp P. are shown in Figure 2 (c)(d),respectively.SWEM shows signiﬁcantly higheraccuracy than CNN for a large range of low sub-space dimension, indicating that SWEM is moreparameter-efﬁcient to get a decent solution.InFigure 2(c), if we set the performance thresholdas 80% testing accuracy, SWEM exhibits a lowerdint than CNN on AG News dataset. However,in Figure 2(d), CNN can leverage more trainableparameters to achieve higher accuracy when d islarge.5.2Linear classiﬁersTo further investigate the quality of representa-tions learned from SWEMs, we employ a linearclassiﬁer on top of the representations for pre-diction, instead of a non-linear MLP layer as inthe previous section.It turned out that utiliz-ing a linear classiﬁer only leads to a very smallperformance drop for both Yahoo! Ans. (from73.53% to 73.18%) and Yelp P. datasets (from93.76% to 93.66%) . This observation highlightsthat SWEMs are able to extract robust and infor-mative sentence representations despite their sim-plicity.5.3Extension to other languagesWe have also tried our SWEM-concat and SWEM-hier models on Sogou news corpus (with thesame experimental setup as (Zhang et al., 2015b)),which is a Chinese dataset represented by Pinyin(a phonetic romanization of Chinese).SWEM-concat yields an accuracy of 91.3%,whileSWEM-hier (with a local window size of 5) ob-tains an accuracy of 96.2% on the test set. Notably,the performance of SWEM-hier is comparable tothe best accuracies of CNN (95.6%) and LSTM(95.2%), as reported in (Zhang et al., 2015b). Thisindicates that hierarchical pooling is more suitablethan average/max pooling for Chinese text classiﬁ-cation, by taking spatial information into account.It also implies that Chinese is more sensitive to lo-cal word-order features than English.6ConclusionsWe have performed a comparative study betweenSWEM (with parameter-free pooling operations)and CNN or LSTM-based models, to representtext sequences on 17 NLP datasets. We furthervalidated our experimental ﬁndings through ad-ditional exploration, and revealed some generalrules for rationally selecting compositional func-tions for distinct problems. Our ﬁndings regard-ing when (and why) simple pooling operations areenough for text sequence representations are sum-marized as follows:• Simple pooling operations are surprisingly ef-fective at representing longer documents (withhundreds of words), while recurrent/convolutionalcompositional functions are most effective whenconstructing representations for short sentences.• Sentiment analysis tasks are more sensitiveto word-order features than topic categorizationtasks.However, a simple hierarchical poolinglayer proposed here achieves comparable resultsto LSTM/CNN on sentiment analysis tasks.• To match natural language sentences, e.g., tex-tual entailment, answer sentence selection, etc.,simple pooling operations already exhibit similaror even superior results, compared to CNN andLSTM.• In SWEM with max-pooling operation, each in-dividual dimension of the word embeddings con-tains interpretable semantic patterns, and groupstogether words with a common theme or topic.\f449ReferencesYossi Adi, Einat Kermany, Yonatan Belinkov, OferLavi, and Yoav Goldberg. 2016.

Some are believed to havebeen taken from Wounded Kneeimmediately after the 1890 massa-cre, when U.S. troops killed asmany as 300 or more Lakota men,women and children.Since the 1890s the collectionhad been kept in a small-town li-brary museum in Barre, Mass.,now known as the Founders Mu-seum, sitting among displays ofVictorian-era dolls, Civil War arti-facts and taxidermy. But last year,after decades of anguished re-quests and false starts, the mu-seum agreed to give the OglalaSioux Tribe the items it hadsought.It has been more than three dec-ades since Congress passed a lawsetting up a protocol for federallyfunded colleges and museums toreturn Native cultural heritageand, in many cases, human re-mains. The pace of restitutionshas been slow, frustrating tribesthat are awaiting the return oftheir plundered patrimony. Butnow, amid signs that more institu-tions are beginning to repatriateNative holdings, citizens of tribeslike the Oglala Sioux find them-selves confronting complicatedquestions about how to handle re-turns in ways that honor the deadand the past, and facilitate healingfor the living.There is broad consensus thathuman remains should be buried.Many call for burying or burningother objects as well — especiallyfunerary items — in accordance Tribes Weigh the Future of Plundered TrophiesBy JULIA JACOBS and KAYLA GAHAGANFinding Way to Honor the Dead and Allowthe Living to HealContinued on Page A12After a sinking that killed 86 migrants,Italy remains locked in a furious debateabout who is responsible.

In his first term, Mr.Trump gradually ramped up pres-sure on the Justice Department,eroding its traditional independ-ence from White House politicalcontrol. He is now unabashedlysaying he will throw that effortinto overdrive if he returns topower.Mr. Trump’s promise fits into alarger movement on the right togut the F.B.I., overhaul a JusticeDepartment that conservativesclaim has been “weaponized”against them and abandon thenorm — which many Republicansview as a facade — that the de-partment should operate inde-pendently from the president.Two of the most important fig-ures in this effort work at thesame Washington-based organi-zation, the Center for RenewingAmerica: Jeffrey B.

But theruling did not resolve the questionof whether the law, the IndianChild Welfare Act, discriminatedagainst non-Native families basedon race.The vote was 7 to 2, with Jus-tices Clarence Thomas and Samu-el A. Alito Jr. dissenting.The case pitted a white fostercouple from Texas against fivetribes and the Interior Depart-ment as they battled over theadoption of a Native Americanchild.Under the act, preference is giv-en to Native families, a policy thatthe couple said violated equal pro-tection principles because ithinges on placement based onrace.The tribes have said that theyare political entities, not racialgroups.

In the fourand a half monthsthat Russian forceshad occupied avillage in easternUkraine, the troops had used thelocal bar as a small outpost,gutting it in the process.The physical destruction of thevillage watering hole in VelykaKomyshuvakha was only part ofwhat the Russians left behind.In the bar’s back room was atwisted blueprint of the minds ofsome of the rank and file whomake up the backbone of theRussian military.

Introduction  This report covers the jurisdictions of Australia, Brazil, Canada, European Union, India, Israel and Japan. As European Union (EU) law regulates drones in the EU, the EU report also includes examples from France, Germany, and Sweden. The EU only allows member states to regulate matters not directly regulated or mandated in the regulation, including age requirements in the open and specified categories and fees charged.   While the United States uses categories such as commercial to define training requirements, not all jurisdictions surveyed distinguish operational and training requirements based on whether the use is commercial. For example, the EU classifies drone categories into “Open,” “Specific,” and “Certified.”   II.  Training & Certification Process    A. Training Requirements  1. Qualifying Age Requirements  Eligibility for drone operations is typically dependent on the type of drone (size, weight) and manner of operation. In the case of smaller drones used for recreational purposes, minors are typically allowed to operate them. For example, Sweden allows the operation of drones in the open category from 15 whereas most other EU member states allow this operation from age 16 which is the same as the age requirement in Japan. Similarly, Canada allows certain use by age 14 but requires a person seeking a license to perform advanced operations to be at least 16 years old.   In order to be eligible to fly a drone commercially however, most jurisdictions require that the operator is at least 18 years old before pursuing relevant training and meeting certification requirements. For example, Brazil specifically requires that any use that is not for recreational use be done by persons 18 years or older. Also India and Israel require that the license holder be at least 18 years old, with India capping the age eligibility at 65 years old. Only Australia does not specify any upper or lower age limits as a precondition for pilot training.   2. Theoretical and Practical Training  To obtain a license to operate drones that are used commercially, theoretical and practical training are typically required in all jurisdictions surveyed. In Australia, the training includes both knowledge and practical skills, which are both tested by a certified training provider. Training with regards to aeronautical knowledge must include at least 15 hours with a training instructor.   In Israel, tested topics include specifically, among others, “aviation law,” “air traffic provisions,”   \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 2 “general technical knowledge,” “principles of meteorology,” “practical navigation principles,” and “safety procedures.” In addition, an applicant must have a minimum of 250 hours of relevant operational experience. The EU does not require practical training for subcategory A1 of its open category, and all other training requirements differ depending on the class identification and the operation category of the drone.  B. Testing   Similar to the training requirements mentioned above, most surveyed jurisdictions require both a knowledge test and practical skills test for licenses to operate drones commercially. The operation of most smaller drones, however, which in the EU are designated as falling in the open category, requires an online written knowledge test on the subjects of air safety, airspace restrictions, aviation regulation, human performance limitations, operational procedures, drone general knowledge, privacy and data protection, insurance, and security.  C. Fees  Fees and the fee structure for training and licensing of drone operations vary among the surveyed jurisdictions. Most jurisdictions require fees for taking the test, as well as for receiving the certification. For example, Brazil leverages separate fees for registration, testing, and the issuance of an airworthiness certificate. In Israel, different fees apply depending on drones’ weight for applications for certificate of fitness, with additional fees for experimental or special use of drones, as well as for operating drones. Member states of the European Union, such as Sweden, also leverage different fees depending on what category the license falls under, making licenses in the open category less expensive than in the specific category. In addition, France allows unemployed jobseekers to take the knowledge exam for free.   D. Certification/License  Most jurisdictions surveyed require that a person who completes the training, testing, and pays the relevant fees, also registers in a national registry before being permitted to operate drones.  III.  Renewal Requirements  Most jurisdictions require renewal of licenses for operating drones both recreationally and commercially. For example, Brazil requires annual revalidations which include knowledge and practical tests. In Israel, licenses expire after 24 months but can be extended if they meet minimum time operational requirements.  In Japan, the license must be renewed after three years and requires completion of additional theoretical training. In the EU, renewal requirements depend on the category the drone operation falls into, with the open category requiring renewal every five years, whereas the specific category does not expire but the certification, which states that the holder continues to comply with relevant rules, is only valid for two years. For the open category, a refresher training instead of retesting may be chosen if the renewal takes place within the validity period. Similarly, India requires refresher training for renewal at least every 10 years.  In Canada, pilot licenses do not expire but license holders must maintain compliance with the recency requirements, including knowledge exams and flight hours.  \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 3  It appears most jurisdictions surveyed do not have an upper age limit for renewal of licenses. Of the surveyed jurisdictions, only India has an explicit upper age requirement, capping renewals at 65 years of age.   It appears Australia has no renewal requirements.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 4 Australia Kelly Buchanan Chief, Foreign, Comparative, and International Law Division II   SUMMARY People who wish to fly certain types of drones in Australia for commercial purposes are required to obtain a remote pilot license (RePL) issued by the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA). Those who trade as drone service providers for hire or reward must hold a remotely piloted aircraft operator’s certificate (ReOC) and can then employ RePL holders to operate drones for the business. To obtain a RePL, a person must take a training course provided by a certified RePL training provider and pass the required theory and practical skills tests for the type and category of RPA he or she intends to fly. The person must also log at least five hours of flying time with the relevant type of drone. Once the requirements have been met, the RePL training provider applies to CASA for a RePL on the person’s behalf. The units, standards, and testing requirements for the training courses are set out in a legislative instrument. Different units apply for different categories of drone, and a RePL will be issued with respect to only the category that a person is qualified to fly. There are no age restrictions or renewal requirements for RePL.   I.  Introduction  In Australia, remotely piloted aircraft (RPA) and those who operate or pilot them for commercial purposes are subject to various rules under part 101 of the Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1988 (Cth) (CASR).1 A Manual of Standards2 (MOS) and other legislative instruments also apply, and the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) has produced guidance material on the rules.3  Holding a remotely piloted aircraft operator’s certificate (ReOC) allows a person or business to trade as a drone service provider for hire or reward. A holder of an ReOC is permitted to conduct a range of RPA operations, to employ remote pilots to operate RPA, and is subject to certain obligations. The ReOC does not allow the holder to operate an RPA – in order to operate an RPA, a person must hold a remote pilot license (RePL).4  RPA are categorized under the CASR according to their size and type.5 An ReOC is not required if a person or business is eligible to operate a “micro RPA” (up to 250 grams) or RPA that fall                                                              1  Civil Aviation Safety Regulations 1988 (Cth) (CASR) (vol 3) pt 101, https://perma.cc/H3RH-UCTT.  2 Part 101 (Unmanned Aircraft and Rockets) Manual of Standards 2019 (as amended) (MOS), https://perma.cc/23VT-T4KN.  3 See Part 101 of CASR Unmanned Aircraft and Rockets, Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA), https://perma.cc/C8UU-XYWP.  4 Remotely Piloted Aircraft Operator’s Certificate, CASA, https://perma.cc/KRU6-FXDA.

ReOC holders can employ remote pilots to operate RPA that weigh less than 7 kilograms (kg), less than 25 kg, less than 150 kg, or more than 150 kg (with additional certification required for the RPA). The ReOC lists the conditions of operation, including the type of RPA, weight restrictions, and manufacturer and model (for RPA over 25 kg).6 ReOC are valid for 12 months and renewals are valid for up to three years.7  Any drone flown for business or as part of a person’s job must be registered with CASA. A person must be aged 16 years or over to register a drone.8  People are able to operate drones of not more than 2 kg (“very small RPA”) for commercial or professional activities for work, training, or community services, or to use a drone of not more than 25 kg (“small RPA”) over their own land for certain purposes, without holding a RePL.9 Certain safety and registration rules apply.10   However, a person who flies micro or very small RPA for business or as part of his or her job, or who flies small RPA over his or her own land, must obtain a RPA operator accreditation (unless he or she holds a RePL). Such accreditation is free, can be completed online, and is valid for three years. A person must be aged 16 years or older to become an accredited operator.11  This report provides information on the training required for a person to obtain a RePL in order to operate different categories of RPA.  II.  Training and Certification Process for Remote Pilot Licenses    To obtain a RePL, a person must get an aviation reference number (ARN), take a training course provided by a certified RePL training provider, pass the required theory part of the RePL course, and pass the practical skills part of the course for the type and category of RPA he or she intends to fly. Once the tests are passed, the RePL training provider applies to CASA for a RePL on the person’s behalf.12 There are no age requirements for obtaining a RePL.13  RePL can also be obtained based on recognition of a person’s aviation experience where he or she has either passed the theory part of any “Part 61 flight crew licence” or has an equivalent military qualification or air traffic control license. International qualifications “may be recognised                                                              6 Remotely Piloted Aircraft Operator’s Certificate, supra note 4. 7 Id. 8 Register Your Drone, CASA, https://perma.cc/MNT8-2DWF.  9 CASA, CASR Part 101: Micro and Excluded Remotely Piloted Aircraft Operations – Plain English Guide 5 & 8 (Sept. 2020), https://perma.cc/8F42-FACC.  10 See Drone Rules, CASA, https://perma.cc/8JXE-5YGJ.  11 Operator Accreditation, CASA, https://perma.cc/UV8K-4KNX.  12 Remote Pilot Licence, CASA, https://perma.cc/NS9V-J937; CASR 101.290 & 101.295 13 Remote Pilot Licence, supra note 12. \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Australia The Law Library of Congress 6 following a review and comparison of the foreign and Australian syllabi.”14 Where a person’s experience is recognized, he or she does not need to sit the theory component of the RePL training course. He or she can either take a course with a certified RePL training provider and pass the skills test plus log five hours of flying time with the RPA, or can book a test flight with CASA and pass the practical skills part of the RePL competency as well as logging five hours of flying time.15  An applicant for a RePL must have general English language competency. A RePL training course may specifically include English language proficiency training and assessment. Otherwise, “applicants must obtain their general English training proficiency by virtue of holding, or having held, a flight crew license issued by CASA.”16  The CASR provisions applicable to RPA are contained in subpart 101.F, with RePL applications, eligibility, conditions, and variations, suspensions, and cancellations covered in division 101.F.3. Provisions related to ReOC are contained in division 101.F.4. In addition, part 11 of the CASR contains provisions relating to applications for RePL.17  The MOS for part 101 “defines a RePL Training Course and includes the required RePL instructor qualifications and requirements for operator documented practices and procedures.”18  A. Training Requirements  Division 2.2 of the MOS contains the standards and requirements for the theory component of the RePL training course (“aeronautical knowledge component”) and “the component of a RePL training course for the manual or automated operation of a category of RPA that an applicant for a RePL proposes to operate” (“practical competency component”).19   The schedules of the MOS set out detailed units and standards for each component of the RePL training courses with respect to different categories of RPA:  • Schedule 2 lists the aeronautical knowledge standards for a RePL training course, including common standards applicable to all categories and “units of knowledge” for the different categories: airplane, helicopter (multirotor class), helicopter (single rotor class), powered-lift, and RPA with a liquid fuel system. • Schedule 3 lists the practical competency standards, again including common standards and “units of practical competency” for each of the above-listed categories.                                                               14 Id. 15 Id. 16 MOS note to 2.03(1). 17 CASR regs 11.033 & 11.034 etc. 18 CASA, Annex A to AC 101-01: Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) Training Course – CASA Guidance A6, https://perma.cc/HK6Y-DQF9.  19 MOS s 2.02. \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Australia The Law Library of Congress 7 • Schedule 4 lists the aeronautical knowledge units, with common units broken into several units covering different areas of knowledge (e.g., basic aviation knowledge; airspace, charts, and aeronautical publications; basic meteorology for RPA operations; electrical and electronic systems for RPA systems; human performance; operations and procedures; operational rules and air law; and automated flight management systems). It also lists category-specific units for each of the RPA categories. • Schedule 5 lists the practical competency units, including several common units and units for each RPA category. The category-specific units cover, for example, control on ground; launch and landing; hover (for certain categories); climb, cruise, and descent (for certain categories); normal operations; advanced maneuvers; and operation in abnormal situations and emergencies. • Schedule 6 lists the flight test standards with respect to each of the categories of RPA, including the flight test requirements, knowledge requirements, and practical flight standards. Applicants must demonstrate their competency by performing the different maneuvers listed for the relevant category within the accuracy/tolerances specified for those maneuvers. They must also demonstrate their knowledge of certain matters with respect to the operation of the RPA in the relevant category.   The MOS requires that “[a] RePL training course for a category of RPA must include training and assessment in the units of aeronautical knowledge (including common units) that are for the category in accordance with the standards and requirements in Schedule 2.”20 The training course must also require the applicant to complete specified units of knowledge contained in schedule 4.21  Similarly, “[a] RePL training course for a category of RPA must include training and assessment in the units of practical competency that are for the category in accordance with the standards and requirements in Schedule 3.”22 The course must require the applicant to complete specified units of practical competency contained in schedule 5.23 In addition, the practical competency component of a course must be for either the automated operation mode (for an applicant for a RePL for automated mode only), or for both automated operation mode and the manual mode (for an applicant for a RePL for the manual operation mode).24 Furthermore, “the practical competency component of a RePL training course for a particular medium or large RPA for which the applicant seeks the RePL must be conducted and assessed with respect to the particular medium or large RPA only.”25                                                                20 Id. s 2.05(1). 21 Id. s 2.05(4). 22 Id. s 2.06(3). 23 Id. s 2.06(6). 24 Id. s 2.06(1). 25 Id. s 2.06(2). \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Australia The Law Library of Congress 8  In relation to the aeronautical knowledge component of a RePL training course, a training organization must provide students with at least 15 hours of contact time with a RePL training instructor. Where the training course covers more than one category of RPA, four additional hours of contact time must be provided for each additional category.26  The CASR require that, in order to be eligible for a RePL, an applicant must have at least five hours of experience in operating an RPA under standard operating conditions.27 According to the MOS, to deliver a RePL training course for any type of RPA, a training organization must ensure that each student is provided with a means of achieving or simulating the flight conditions and variables mentioned in each item of the practical competencies for the relevant category in schedule 5 of the MOS. The amount of flying required for a category, size, or complexity of RPA must be specified in the training organizations documented practices and procedures.28  B. Testing   1.  Theory Component  Division 2.3 of the MOS applies to the testing of the RePL training course theory component. It states that   (1)   To pass the theory component of a RePL training course (the aeronautical knowledge component), an applicant must pass an examination (the aeronautical knowledge examination, or the examination). (2) The examination must be a closed-book examination except for any documents concerning the RPAS: (a)   authored by CASA and published on its website; or (b)   authored by AA [Airservices Australia] and published on its website.  Note   The examination is one in which the candidate must not use any RePL training course document or material, separate from the examination text, to assist in answering examination questions. However, official, online CASA and AA documents may be used.29  The pass mark for the examination is 85 percent, with the examination required to be assessed by a RePL training instructor or the chief remote pilot for the RePL training organization. If an applicant fails the examination three times, he or she can only re-sit it a fourth time if he or she has repeated the aeronautical knowledge component of the RePL training course and at least 14 days have elapsed since the third attempt.30                                                                26 Id. s 2.26. 27 CASR reg 101.295(2)(c). 28 MOS s 2.28. 29 Id. s 2.08. 30 Id. s 2.09. \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Australia The Law Library of Congress 9  The examination “must be a set of at least 80 multiple-choice questions covering all of the aeronautical knowledge units in Schedule 4 that are for the relevant category of RPA, including for automated flight management systems and liquid-fuel systems if required (the relevant units), for which the applicant is applying for a RePL (the relevant RePL).”31 The MOS sets the minimum number of questions to be based on items in the relevant units.32 The duration of the examination must be the sum of 15 minutes plus one minute for each of the questions.33 Each training organization must have at least four unique sets of questions that have been approved by CASA, with the examinations to be randomly rotated for each training course.34  2.  Practical Component  Division 2.4 of the MOS contains provisions on the assessment of the practical competencies for a RePL training course. It states as follows:  (2)  Subject to sections 2. and 2.19AB, to complete the RePL training course component for the operation of a category of RPA (the practical competencies), the applicant must be assessed as competent in each of the units in Schedule 5 (the relevant practical competency units) that is: (a)   for the relevant RPA category (including with or without a liquid-fuel system, as the case requires); and (b)   conducted:              (i)  for the automated operation mode; or             (ii)  for both the automated operation mode and the manual mode;          as the case requires for the RePL that the applicant is applying for (the relevant RePL). (3)  To be assessed as competent, the applicant must: (a)   demonstrate to a RePL training instructor all of the behaviours mentioned in each item of the relevant practical competency unit; and (b) satisfy the RePL training instructor that each of the behaviours referred to in paragraph (a) has been demonstrated within the relevant tolerances, and across the range of variables, (if any), mentioned for the item; and (c)   having satisfied the requirements of paragraphs (a) and (b), pass a RePL training course flight test in the relevant RPA, conducted in accordance with the RePL training organisation’s documented practices and procedures by an examiner. (4)  Subject to subsection (5), for subsection (3), a behaviour must be demonstrated: (a)   for the relevant RPA category and the relevant RePL; and (b)  across as many of the range of variables as the operating conditions reasonably permit. (5)  If a variable was not selected for demonstration because operating conditions made it impossible in practice to demonstrate the variable, the RePL training instructor must: (a)  require the applicant to provide:  (i)  a satisfactory computerised simulation of the flight characteristics of the RPA under the variable, using a computerised simulation system that meets the                                                              31 Id. s 2.10(1). 32 Id. s 2.10(2). 33 Id. s 2.11. 34 Id. s 2.12. \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Australia The Law Library of Congress 10 standards and requirements set out in the operator’s documented practices and procedures; or (ii)  a detailed oral explanation of the variable, accompanied by indicative manual use of the RPA’s functional elements, or a description of such use; and (b) certify in writing to the RePL training organisation, in accordance with the organisation’s documented practices and procedures, that:  (i)   operating conditions made it impossible in practice to demonstrate the variable; and  (ii)  for reasons stated in the certification, it would be unreasonable to require that the variable be demonstrated on another occasion. (6)   For paragraph (3) (b), a behaviour demonstrated outside a relevant tolerance may be considered to have been demonstrated within the tolerance if the RePL training instructor: (a)   is satisfied that:  (i)  the only reason for failure to demonstrate the behaviour is the unavoidable impact of the relevant operating conditions; and (ii)  in the circumstances, the behaviour that was demonstrated was not so far outside the tolerance as to indicate a lack of competence in the relevant operating conditions; and (b) certifies to the RePL training organisation, in accordance with the organisation’s documented practices and procedures, that paragraph (a) was the case.  (7)  The training course flight test for the relevant RPA mentioned in paragraph (3) (c) must be in accordance with the flight test standards in Schedule 6.35  Division 2.8 of the MOS contains additional provisions related to flight tests. It states that a student enrolled with an RPA training organization “may attempt the flight test for a RePL at any time during the RePL training course,” provided the attempt meets the requirements.36  In addition, as noted above, the MOS states that a RePL training course may include, as part of the practical competency component, “training and assessment in general English language proficiency.”37  C. Fees  Fees for RePL and other services related to unmanned aircraft are set under part 17 of schedule 1 of the Civil Aviation (Fees) Regulations 1995 (Cth). An hourly rate is charged by CASA for the granting of a RePL, including processing and consideration of an application.38 The regulations provide that the hourly rate for this service is AU$160 (approximately US$111).39                                                               35 Id. s 2.18. 36 Id. 2.31(1). 37 Id. s 2.03(1).   38 Civil Aviation (Fees) Regulations 1995 (Cth) sch 1 item 17.5, https://perma.cc/EU67-CD5G.  39 Id. reg 4(2)(c). See also Service Standards and Fees, CASA, https://perma.cc/R5CY-YA9F.  \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Australia The Law Library of Congress 11 CASA provides a directory of ReOC holders, including those certified to conduct RePL training.40 CASA has provided detailed guidance on training provider certification processes and course requirements as part of an advisory circular on part 101 of the CASR.41 It appears that training providers can set their own fees for the RePL training courses, which include the assessment process and may include the RePL application cost.42  D. Certification/License  Each student who successfully completes a RePL training course must be given a certificate of course completion by the training organization.43 As noted above, the training organization applies to CASA for a RePL on behalf of the student. The CASR provide for conditions to be placed on RePL, including conditions that allow the person to operate RPA of only specified kinds, limit the areas where he or she may operate RPA, or allow him or her to operate RPA only in visual meteorological conditions.44 In addition,   (3)  It is a condition of a remote pilot licence that the licence holder must not operate an RPA above 400 ft AGL in controlled airspace, or within 3 nautical miles of the movement area of a controlled aerodrome, unless he or she holds at least one of the following qualifications: (a)   an aeronautical radio operator certificate; (b)   a flight crew licence; (c)   an ATC licence; (d)   a military qualification equivalent to a licence mentioned in paragraph (b) or (c); (e)   a flight service licence. (4)  It is a condition of a remote pilot licence that an RPA must be operated within the visual line of sight of the licence holder unless he or she: (a)   has passed:  (i)  an aeronautical knowledge examination (within the meaning of Part 61) for the grant of an instrument rating under Part 61; or (ii)  an aviation licence theory examination before 1 September 2014 that is taken to be an equivalent requirement for the grant of an instrument rating under regulation 202.274; or (iii)  an approved examination; and  (b)  either:  (i)   holds both a certificate as an RPA operator under Division 101.F.4 and an approval under regulation 101.029 to operate the RPA beyond the person’s visual line of sight; or  (ii) is a member of an RPA operator’s personnel and the RPA operator holds both a certificate as an RPA operator under Division 101.F.4 and an approval under                                                              40 Remotely Piloted Aircraft Operator’s Certificate (ReOC) Holders, CASA, https://perma.cc/PN6A-KUR2.  41 Annex A to AC 101-01: Remote Pilot Licence (RePL) Training Course – CASA Guidance, supra note 18. 42 See, e.g., Remote Pilot Licence Multirotor 25kgs, Avisssist, https://perma.cc/64HP-WH2X; Remote Pilot Training Courses, Aviation Australia, https://perma.cc/6XUH-PNS9; CASA Drone Certification – Initial RePL Training, UAV Training Australia, https://perma.cc/MV93-BKJ3.  43 MOS s 2.29. 44 CASR reg 101.300(2). \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Australia The Law Library of Congress 12 regulation 101.029 for the operator’s personnel to operate RPA beyond their visual line of sight.

Renewal Requirements  There are no renewal requirements for RePL.                                                              45 Id. reg 101.300(3)–(5).  \fThe Law Library of Congress 13 Brazil Eduardo Soares Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY In Brazil, the operation of model aircrafts does not require any specific licensing or qualification, but must be confined to appropriate spaces; they cannot fly above 400 feet and can weigh up to 250 gr.    Remotely-piloted aircrafts, commonly known as drones, are divided into three classes according to their weight. A person must be 18 years old, have a license, medical certificate, and carry third-party insurance to operate such devices. The equipment must be registered with the telecommunications agency and, depending on its class, flights must be registered with the entity responsible for the Brazilian airspace. The pilot must comply with the regulations of the civil aviation agency.   I.  Introduction  A.  Definition  According to the Center for Investigation and Prevention of Aeronautical Accidents of the Air Force Command in Brazil, “drone” is considered to be a generic term without technical support or legal definition to characterize any and all unmanned flying objects, be it of any purpose (professional, recreational, military, commercial, etc.), origin, or characteristic.1  Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (Veículo Aéreo Não Tripulado, VANT) is the official terminology provided by Brazilian air transport regulatory bodies to define these objects.2   Air Information Circular AIC N 21/10 of September 23, 2010, issued by the Department of Airspace Control (Departamento de Controle do Espaço Aéreo, DECEA) for the purpose of presenting the necessary information for the use of these devices in Brazilian airspace,3 defines a VANT as an aerial vehicle designed to operate without a pilot on board, which has a payload on board and that is not used for purely recreational purposes.4  In this definition, all three-axis controllable airplanes, helicopters, and airships are included, excluding, therefore, traditional balloons and model aircrafts (aeromodelos).5                                                               1 DECEA Esclarece Normas para Voos de Drones no Brasil, Centro de Investigação e Prevenção de Acidentes Aeronáuticos, Comando da Aeronáutica, https://perma.cc/NP62-KCJS . 2 Id. 3 Circular de Informações Aeronáuticas AIC No. 21/10, de 23 de Setembro de 2010, Section 1.1, https://perma.cc/XU6D-8Q4G. 4 Id.

Regulatory Bodies  1. National Telecommunications Agency  The National Telecommunications Agency (Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações, ANATEL) was created by Law No. 9,472, of July 16, 1997,11 with the function of regulatory body for telecommunications and is subordinated to the Ministry of Communications.12  2. Department of Airspace Control  The DECEA is the organization responsible for controlling Brazilian airspace, providing air navigation services that enable flights, and the ordering of air traffic flows in the country. 13   On May 22, 2020, DECEA enacted Ordinance No. 112/DGCEA, which approved the reenactment of ICA 100-400, Instruction on Unmanned Aircrafts and the Access to Brazilian Airspace (the Instruction).14 The purpose of the Instruction is to regulate the procedures and responsibilities necessary for safe access to Brazilian airspace by unmanned aircrafts.15   The Instruction determines that it is the responsibility of the DECEA, as the central body of the Brazilian Airspace Control System (Sistema de Controle do Espaço Aéreo Brasileiro, SISCEAB), to                                                              6 Circular de Informações Aeronáuticas AIC No. 21/10, Section 2.2.3. 7 Id.

Section 1.1. \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 15 legislate on the procedures for access to the airspace, and that the other regulatory bodies are responsible for dealing with subjects of their respective areas of activity.16  According to the Instruction, an aircraft is any device that can sustain itself in the atmosphere from reactions of the air other than the reactions of the air against the earth's surface.17  An aircraft that does not have a crew on board is an aircraft and, therefore, to fly in the airspace which falls  under the responsibility of Brazil, it must follow the rules established by the competent authorities of national aviation.18 The remote pilot is ultimately responsible for the faithful observance and fulfillment of all the parameters provided for in Instruction ICA 100-40.19  3. National Civil Aviation Agency  The National Civil Aviation Agency (Agência Nacional de Aviação Civil, ANAC) was created by Law No. 11,182 of September 27, 200520 and its purpose is to regulate and inspect civil aviation and aeronautical and airport infrastructure activities.21  C. Classes of RPAs  RPAs are divided into three classes, according to the maximum take-off weight, in which the weights of the battery or fuel of the equipment and any cargo eventually transported must be considered.22 The classification is only applicable to RPAs and not to model aircrafts.23 The classes are as follows:  • Class 1 – Maximum take-off weight greater than 150 kg (330.7 lb)  • Class 2 – Maximum take-off weight greater than 25 kg and up to 150 kg (55.1 lb – 330.7 lb)  • Class 3 – Maximum take-off weight up to 25 kg (55.1 lb) o Model aircraft or RPA with a maximum take-off weight of up to 250g (0.55lb) o RPA with maximum take-off weight greater than 250g and up to 25 kg (0.55 lb – 55.1 lb).24                                                                16 Id.

RPA are regulated by the Aeronautics Act and Part IX of the Canadian Aviation Regulations—the latter being supplemented by standards, guidelines, and circulars issued by Transport Canada. These regulations prescribe terms for lawful drone usage; among them, individuals can find licensing requirements for various types of drone operations. Corporations seeking to fly drones within Canada must satisfy the requirements for a “Basic” or “Advanced” license; these classes are distinguished by the complexity of their corresponding maneuvers, and not the commercial or recreational nature of their operations. Should commercial drone activities exceed the limitations of their license class, a Special Flight Operations Certificate can be obtained on behalf of one’s business. Each class of license, however, presents its own fees, testing requirements, and 24-month recency requirements for maintaining its validity.  I. IntroductionA. Legislative FrameworkDrone regulation is a competency of the federal legislature—despite it not being an enumerated power in the Constitution Act, 1867.1 The Supreme Court of Canada provided the basis for this conclusion in the 1952 case of Johannesson v. Municipality of West St. Paul,2 in which it asserted federal jurisdiction over the matter of aeronautics as within the Canadian government’s duty “to make Laws for the Peace, Order, and good Government of Canada,” which are known as the POGG powers.3 The Supreme Court explained that the usage of POGG powers is justified by the national importance of the aerospace industry, as “from its inherent nature,” its effects “concern the country as a whole.”4  Drones, or Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), are subject to the Aeronautics Act, 1985.5 An RPA must comply with the act’s subsidiary regulations, the Canadian Aviation Regulations (CARs).6 * This report was prepared with the assistance of Law Library intern Miranda Lalla.1 Constitution Act, 1867 (Const.), 30 & 31 Vict., c 3, § 91 (U.K.), https://perma.cc/MY2G-MM72.2 Johannesson v.

Corresponding penalties regarding public safety can be found in the Criminal Code, 1985.8 Matters of privacy infringement are addressed in both the Privacy Act, 1985,9 and the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, 2000.10 It must be noted that the legislative framework imposed by the Aeronautics Act and the CARs takes effect regardless of the RPA’s intended usage. In other words, the commercial or recreational nature of one’s RPA usage does not play a role in the determination of pilot certificate class or usage restrictions.   B. Terminology   An RPA is defined as “a set of configurable elements consisting of a remotely piloted aircraft, its control station, the command and control links and any other system elements required during flight operation.”11 Since weight plays an important factor in determining an RPA’s classification, it should be noted that, despite being encompassed by its definition, the weight of the control station is not taken into account when weighing the aircraft. However, any additional components to the body of the device, such as a camera or a propeller, contribute to the calculation of its weight.   A micro remotely piloted aircraft system (mRPA), weighs less than 250 grams. These are exempt from registration and certification requirements.12  A small remotely piloted aircraft system (sRPA), weighs between 250 grams and 25 kilograms. It is regulated by Subpart 1 of Part IX of the CARs.13  An sRPA must be registered and its operator certified in accordance with the type of operation performed by the device.   C. Operations   Different licensing requirements apply depending on whether drone operations are classified as “basic”14 or “advanced.”15 For an RPA operation to qualify as “basic,” it must meet the following five conditions, in which the drone is:                                                  7 Aeronautics Act § 3.  8 Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c C-46, https://perma.cc/6QNR-KMNK.  9 Privacy Act, R.S.C. 1985, c P-21, https://perma.cc/DD7H-9G7Y.  10 Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act, S.C. 2000, c 5, https://perma.cc/KQL2-ETGP.  11 CARs § 101.01(1). 12 Find Your Category of Drone Operation, Transport Canada, https://perma.cc/5ND6-S6BA (last updated Feb. 19, 2022).  13 Id.  14 CARs § 901.55. 15 CARs § 901.64.  \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Canada The Law Library of Congress 31   • flown in uncontrolled airspace,16 • flown more than 30 metres (100 feet) horizontally from bystanders, • never flown over bystanders,17 • flown more than three nautical miles from a certified airport or a military airfield, and • flown more than one nautical mile from a certified heliport.18   If any one of these criteria are not met, an RPA owner is deemed to be conducting “advanced” operations and will be subject to a more rigorous certification process.   II.  Training and Certification Process    A. Training Requirements  No minimum flight hours are required for the allocation of either a basic or advanced operations pilot certificate. However, training hours within the framework of a recurrent training program can be used to fulfill recency requirements once a pilot certificate is acquired.19   1. Recency Requirements   Holders of the basic or advanced sRPA pilot certificate are granted a 24-month period to fulfill each set of recency requirements. These requirements can take the form of  • (a) attendance at a safety seminar endorsed by Transport Canada Aviation; • (b) completion of an RPAS [remotely piloted aircraft system] recurrent training program designed to update pilot knowledge, which includes, human factors, environmental factors, route planning, operations near aerodromes/airports, and applicable regulations, rules and procedures; or • (c) completion of a Transport Canada endorsed self-paced study program, which is designed to update pilot knowledge in the subjects specified in paragraph (b).20   Training requirements take the form of continuing education. Corporations that fail to ensure their pilots meet their 24-month requirements can be subject to penalties of up to Canadian                                                  16 Nav Canada, Designated Airspace Handbook 6, https://perma.cc/8ZGL-QY36.

Upon request, pilots must be able to show proof of training hours.22 In addition, they must be able to produce their pilot certification upon request.23   2. Age Requirements  Age restrictions for registration of an sRPA vary in accordance with the certificate class. Both a certificate for basic operations, formally referred to as a “Pilot Certificate—Small Remotely Piloted Aircraft (VLOS) — Basic Operations” and that for advanced operations, formally referred to as a “Pilot Certificate—Remotely Piloted Aircraft (VLOS) — Advanced Operations” require that certain basic criteria be met for issuance by the minister of Transport. These are listed in the CARs.24 They require that a registrant be at least 14 years of age; a Canadian citizen or a permanent resident of Canada; a corporation incorporated under the territorial, provincial, or federal laws of Canada; or a municipal, provincial, or federal entity. However, individuals under the age of 14, although unable to register an sRPA themselves, are permitted to conduct basic operations if under the supervision of the holder of either a basic or an advanced RPA pilot certificate.25 Further exacting age requirements are requested for registration of an RPA when a pilot intends to conduct advanced operations; he or she must be at least 16 years of age.26 However, as with aspiring basic operations licensees, the possibility to conduct advanced operations remains open to individuals under 16 years of age, when directly supervised by the holder of an Advanced RPA pilot certificate.27  B. Testing   A pilot certificate for basic operations is granted by the minister of Transport upon completion of an RPAS examination.28 This examination is known as the Small RPAS exam, and it is designed to test knowledge across multiple areas, such as air traffic rules and procedures, RPAS airframes, power plants, propulsion and systems, human factors, meteorology, navigation, flight operations, and the theory of flight and radiotelephony.29 The exam is completed online, through the Transport Canada Drone Management Portal, in English or French. It must be completed                                                  21 Transport Canada, Aeronautical Information Manual (TC AIM), RPA—Remotely Piloted Aircraft 451 (Mar. 24, 2022), https://perma.cc/MBZ9-YB3N.  22 CARs § 901.56.  23 CARs §§ 901.55, 901.64.  24 CARs § 901.04. 25 CARs § 901.54(2). 26 CARs § 901.64 (a). 27 CARs § 901.64 (c).  28 CARs § 901.55 (b).  29 Transport Canada, Knowledge Requirements for Pilots of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems 250 g up to and Including 25 kg, Operating Within Visual Line-of-Sight (VLOS) - TP 15263, https://perma.cc/3TLB-ULPL.  \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Canada The Law Library of Congress 33 without   assistance; to copy or solicit aid from any other person during the examination is a direct violation of the CARs.30 The passing mark is 65%, and a retake is permitted after 24 hours.31   A pilot certificate for advanced operations is granted by the minister of Transport upon completion of a two-fold examination. First, the Small RPAS exam must be passed with a minimum grade of 80%.32 Once completed, a reference number will be attributed to the potential licensee, and this will be used to pass to the second phase of evaluation: an in-person flight review.33  The flight review, performed at a Drone Flight School under an affiliated reviewer,34 will serve to evaluate multiple competencies. To complete a flight review successfully, individuals must demonstrate their capacity to   • (i) describe the site survey process, • (ii) describe emergency procedures that apply to flying an RPAS, including lost-link procedures and procedures to follow in the event of a fly-away, including who to contact, • (iii) describe the method by which to inform Transport Canada of an incident or accident, • (iv) successfully perform pre-flight checks of their RPAS, • (v) perform a take-off, • (vi) demonstrate the ability to navigate around obstacles, • (vii) demonstrate the ability to recognize distances, and • (viii) perform a landing.35  Once the flight review is passed, an application for a pilot certificate of advanced operations can be completed on the online portal.36                                                     30 CARs § 901.58. 31 CARs § 901.59. 32 Transport Canada, supra note 31.  33 Complete a Flight Review for Drones, Transport Canada, https://perma.cc/X9W6-XQ4L (last updated May 30, 2019). 34 Become a Flight Reviewer for Drones: 3.

Fees  Registration is only required for drones above 250 grams—in other words, sRPAs. Registration fees cost of CAD$5.37 Individuals requiring a flight operations certificate are exempt from this fee.38  Fees for the flight review are set by the reviewer. Once the flight review is passed, and an individual is deemed eligible for an advanced operations certificate, this certification costs an additional CAD$5 fee (along with the CAD$5 registration fee, and the flight review cost).39   D. Certification/License  1. Special Flight Operations Certificate  Additional certification, called a Special Flight Operations Certificate (SFOC), may be of interest to commercial drone pilots seeking to perform operations beyond the scope of a basic or advanced pilot certificate.   An SFOC is required if  • you are a foreign operator (that is, not a Canadian citizen, permanent resident of Canada or a corporation incorporated by or under the laws of Canada or a province), authorized to operate a drone for the same purpose in your home country; • you want to fly at a special aviation event or an advertised event; • you want to fly closer to a military airport; • you want to fly your drone beyond visual line-of-sight40; • your drone weighs over 25 kilograms (kg); • you want to fly your drone at higher altitudes41; • you want to fly your drone carrying dangerous or hazardous payloads (e.g. chemicals); • you want to fly more than five drones at the same time.42                                                   37 Registering Your Drone: Overview, Transport Canada, https://perma.cc/DAE8-LSFJ (last updated April 19, 2021). 38 Id.  39 Getting a Drone Pilot Certificate, Transport Canada, https://perma.cc/6LGX-4YMC (last updated June 14, 2022).  40 Fly Your Drone Beyond Visual Line-of-Sight, Transport Canada, https://perma.cc/6U6P-8FFQ (last updated Oct. 14, 2020).  41 CARs § 901.25 (1).  42 Get Permission for Special Drone Operations, Transport Canada, https://perma.cc/S9PG-C5BK (last updated Oct. 14, 2020).  \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Canada The Law Library of Congress 35 If applied for on behalf of a business, an SFOC must be registered with the legal and trade name of the corporation. If the business is incorporated outside of Canada, it must already have authorization to conduct drone operations in its country of incorporation, and this approval must be proven through an attestation, included with the SFOC application.   2. Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act  Businesses operating drones in Canada must also abide by the Personal Information Protection and Electronic Documents Act (PIPEDA). This requires that meaningful consent be given when handling personal information in the course of commercial activities.43 This is a consideration if a drone collects pictures, video, or any other “factual or subjective information about an identifiable individual.”44 Privacy violations may go beyond PIPEDA and lead to charges of “voyeurism, mischief, creating a nuisance, and violations of provincial or municipal laws.”45  III.

In 2019, the European Commission adopted an implementing regulation that governs the operation of commercial and recreational UASs and sets out requirements for their remote pilots, as well as a delegated regulation setting out technical requirements for drones. The rules are directly applicable in the EU Member States, but they may enact national rules for operating drones for subjects falling outside the scope of the regulations.    Drone operations are divided into the following three categories: open, specific, and certified. UAS open operations are further subdivided into categories A1, A2, and A3, on the basis of operational limitations, requirements for the remote pilot, and technical requirements for UAS. In addition, depending on their technical requirements, UAS are divided into five different classes and must have a Conformitè Européenne marking.    Training requirements for remote pilots differ depending on the class identification and the operation category of the UAS. In general, the minimum age for remote pilots operating a UAS in the open and specific category is 16 years. Likewise, testing requirements vary in the different UAS categories and subcategories. In general, remote pilots must complete an online training course, pass an online theoretical knowledge examination, and, depending on the UAS category, pass an additional theoretical knowledge examination. Licenses are generally valid for five years and may be renewed by either retesting or by completing a refresher training. Fees differ from Member State to Member State.   I.  Introduction  Regulation (EU) 2018/1139 updates European Union (EU) safety legislation in the field of civil aviation and includes, among other things, rules for unmanned aircraft systems (UASs), commonly referred to as drones.1 UASs are defined as “any aircraft of any operating mass flown autonomously or remotely without a pilot on board.”2 Remote pilots are defined as “natural person[s] responsible for safely conducting the flight of an unmanned aircraft by operating its flight controls, either manually or, when the unmanned aircraft flies automatically, by monitoring its course and remaining able to intervene and change the course at any time.”3 “Unmanned                                                              1 Regulation (EU) 2018/1139, 2018 O.J.

They adopt a risk-based approach, and, as such, do not differentiate between commercial and non-commercial UAS activities. Instead, they consider the weight and the specifications of the UAS and the operation it is intended to conduct.   II.  Categories of Drone Operations  The implementing regulation divides drone operations into the following three categories: open, specific, and certified.11 Depending on the category, drone operators require an operational authorization or certification from the national authorities. No authorization is required for the open category, whereas the specific category requires an operational authorization.

Open Category  Drone operations are classified as “open” where the following requirements, among others, are met:  • the UAS has a maximum take-off mass of less than 25 kilograms (25kg, about 55 pounds), • the remote pilot ensures that the UAS is kept at a safe distance from people and is not flown over assemblies of people, • the remote pilot keeps the UAS in visual line of sight operation (VLOS) at all times, • the UAS is kept within 120 meters (about 394 feet) from the closest point of the surface of the earth, • the UAS does not carry dangerous goods and does not drop any material.13  UAS “open” operations are further subdivided into categories A1, A2, and A3, on the basis of operational limitations, requirements for the remote pilot, and technical requirements for UAS.14  With regard to operational limitations, subcategory A1 UAS may not overfly assemblies of people and must be conducted, when the follow-me mode is active, up to a distance of 50 meters from the remote pilot.15 Subcategory A1 only applies to C0 or C1-class UAS.16   Subcategory A2 prohibits overflying uninvolved persons, and the UAS operations must take place at a safety distance of at least 30 meters from them. However, remote pilots may reduce the safety distance to a minimum of 5 meters from uninvolved persons when they are operating a UAS with an active low speed mode function and after they have evaluated the situation with regard to the weather conditions, the performance of the unmanned aircraft, and the segregation of the overflown area.17 Subcategory A2 only applies to class C2 UAS that are operated with an active and updated direct remote identification system and geo-awareness function.18  Lastly, for subcategory A3, the UAS operation must take place in an area where the remote pilot reasonably expects that no uninvolved person will be endangered, meaning outside urban areas, be conducted within a safety distance of at least 150 meters from residential, commercial,                                                              12 Id. 13 Id. art. 4. 14 Id. annex pt.

Specific Category  If one of the requirements for open operations is not met, the drone operation is qualified as “specific” and requires an operational authorization. The operator must submit a risk assessment together with the application. The authorization will be granted when the authorities are convinced that the risk of operation can be mitigated. An individual authorization is not required if the drone is operated in the framework of a model aircraft club or association that has received an authorization.21  C. Certified Category  Drone operations are classified as “certified” when they are certified in accordance with specific enumerated standards outlined in EU law and the operation involves the  • operation over assemblies of people, • transport of people, or • carriage of dangerous goods that may result in high risk for third parties in case of an accident.22  Drone flights with passengers on board, such as air taxis, would be an example.23 Furthermore, the certified category also applies to drone operations where the national authority considers that the risk cannot be adequately mitigated without certification of the drone and the operator, and the licensing of the remote pilot.24   D. Class Identification  Lastly, depending on their technical requirements, UAS are divided into five different classes and must have a Conformitè Européenne (CE) marking.25 The class identifications are C0, C1, C2, C3,                                                              19 Id. annex, pt.

The drone class identification is supplied by the manufacturer at the time of purchase and is visible on the packaging.26  III.  Training and Certification Process   A. Training and Age Requirements  Training requirements for remote pilots differ depending on the class identification and the operation category of the UAS. In general, the minimum age for remote pilots operating a UAS in the open and specific category is 16 years.27 However, there are exceptions to this general rule, and EU Member States may also lower the minimum age for remote pilots for certain categories. If a Member State decides to lower the minimum age, those remote pilots may only operate a UAS in that Member State.28   1. No Training/No Minimum Age  No training is required if the UAS operations fall in subcategory A1 of the open category and the UAS either has a C0 class identification label, is privately built and has a maximum weight of less than 250 grams (250g), or was purchased before December 31, 2023, without a class identification label and a maximum weight of less than 250g.29 However, the UAS operator must be familiar with the manufacturer’s instructions for the UAS.30   There are no minimum age requirements for remote pilots if the UAS is privately built with a maximum take-off mass of less than 250g, a toy, or operated under the direct supervision of a registered remote pilot.31  2. Open Category  For operations in subcategories A1 and A3, the remote pilot must complete an online training course, but no practical training is required.32 Remote pilots in subcategory A2 of the open category, on the other hand, must complete an online training course and self-practical training.33 All remote pilots in the open category must be familiar with the manufacturer’s instructions for the UAS.34 There are no mandatory flying hours. The EU Member States are authorized to lower the minimum age for operating a UAS in the open category by four years down to 12 years;                                                              26 Id. art. 16, annex pt. 7, no. 4. 27 Implementing Regulation, art. 9, para. 1. 28 Id. art. 9, paras. 3, 4. 29 Id. art. 20, annex, pt.

Specific Category  The specific category is divided into standard scenario 1 (STS-01) and standard scenario 2 (STS-02).37 STS-01 involves operating the UAS within visual line of sight (VLOS) over a controlled ground area in a populated environment, whereas STS-02 involves an operation beyond visual line of sight (BVLOS) with airspace observers over a controlled ground area in a sparsely populated area. Remote pilots operating in STS-01 must complete an online training course as well as practical skill training and assessment on preflight actions, in-flight procedures, and postflight actions.38 The exact areas to be covered in the practical skill training and assessment are set out in a table contained in appendix 1, chapter 1 of the annex to the implementing regulation.39 They include, among other matters, operation planning, airspace considerations, and site risk assessment; UAS preflight inspection and set-up; knowledge of the basic actions to be taken in the event of an emergency situation; maintaining an effective look-out and keeping the UAS within VLOS at all times; and shutting down and securing the UAS.  Likewise, remote pilots operating a UAS in STS-02 must complete an online training course as well as practical skill training and assessment as necessary for STS-01.40 However, the training in STS-02 includes additional subjects and areas, such as airspace scanning for BVLOS operations conducted under STS-02.41   Member States are authorized to lower the minimum age requirement for remote pilots operating in the specific category by as much as two years down to 14 years of age; however, it appears that, with the exception of Sweden, no Member States have done this so far.42  4. Certified Category  The regulations do not contain any specific requirements for the certified category with regard to training or age. The remote pilot is required to hold a pilot license, meaning that national laws on the licensing of pilots apply.43 Further detailed requirements for UAS operations in the certified                                                              35 Id. art. 9, para. 3(a). Germany and France, among other Member States, have not lowered the minimum age for this category.  36 8 kap. 15 § Luftfartsförordning (SFS 2010:770), https://perma.cc/C7TD-SR96.  37 Implementing Regulation, annex, app. 1, chs. 1, 2. 38 Id. annex, app. 1, ch. 1, UAS.STS-01.020, point (1)(e), point (2)(a). 39 Id. annex, app. 1, ch. 1, amend.

The website of the European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) states, “in order to allow operations in the certified category almost all the aviation regulations will need to be amended. So this will be a major task. EASA decided to conduct this activity in multiple phases. . . .”44 B. TestingTesting requirements vary in the different UAS categories and subcategories. 1.Open CategoryIn addition to completing an online training course, remote pilots operating UAS in the A1 and A3 subcategories must pass an online theoretical knowledge examination.45 The examination comprises 40 multiple-choice questions distributed appropriately across the following subjects: air safety, airspace restrictions, aviation regulation, human performance limitations, operational procedures, drone general knowledge, privacy and data protection, insurance, and security.46 At least 75% of the questions must be answered correctly in order to pass both the online training and the exam.47 However, both may be taken several times if the score is below 75%. The examination is taken at a competent national authority that the Member States have designated for that purpose, which also issues a “proof of completion of an online theoretical knowledge examination.”48 As an example, the competent national authority for training and the issuance of certifications in Germany is the German Federal Aviation Authority (Luftfahrt-Bundesamt, LBA).49 In France, it is the General Directorate of Civil Aviation (Direction Générale de l’Aviation Civile, DGAC),50 and in Sweden, the Swedish Transport Agency (Transportstyrelsen).51 Remote pilots operating UAS in the A2 subcategory must hold a certificate of remote pilot competency issued by the competent national authority or by an entity recognized by the competent authority of the Member State where the UAS operator is registered. 52 To obtain this certificate, after completing an online training course, A2 operators must pass the same online 44 EASA, supra note 23. 45 Implementing Regulation, annex, pt.

Specific Category  The specific category contains different rules for UAS operators and remote pilots. UAS operators must obtain an operational authorization from the competent authority.61 They must conduct an operational risk assessment and submit it together with the application.62 The risk assessment must include, among other things, information regarding the competence of the personnel for conducting the operation, including their composition, roles, responsibilities, training, and recent experience.63 Obtaining an operational authorization itself does not involve any training or testing. However, the UAS operator is responsible for the UAS operation and must comply with detailed requirements; in particular, he or she must designate a remote pilot for each operation and ensure that this remote pilot complies with all applicable training and testing requirements.64                                                              53 Id. annex, pt.

However, as mentioned, remote pilots are required to hold a pilot license, meaning that national testing requirements for pilot licenses are applicable. C. FeesFees for training, testing, and certifications differ from Member State to Member State. As an example, in Germany, fees are set out in the Fee Ordinance of the State Aviation Administration (Kostenverordnung der Luftfahrtverwaltung, LuftkostV).71 In the open category, fees for issuing a document confirming that the examination has been passed are 25 euros (about US$25.46) in the A1/A3 subcategories and €30 (about US$30.55) in the A2 subcategory.72 Renewals in all three subcategories are €15 (about US$15.72).73 In the specific category, the fee for issuing a document 65 Id. art. 12, para. 4.  66 Id. art. 8, para. 2, annex, pt.

The registration of UAS operators in the open and specific category costs €20 to €50 (about US$20 to US$51) for natural as well as legal persons.78 In the certified category, the registration of a drone is €100 (about US$102).79   As another example, in France, the fee for taking a license test for all drone pilots subject to licensing is €30 per exam.80 Unemployed job seekers, however, can take it without charge.81  In Sweden, the cost for taking a license test in the open categories A1/A3 and A2 is Swedish Kronor 130 (SEK130, about US$12).82 There are no annual fees for the open category, but there is a SEK50 (about US$5) renewal fee.83 The fee for testing requirements in the specific category is SEK800 (about US$76), followed by a SEK500 (about US$47) annual fee and a SEK200 (about US$19) renewal fee.84 For operators that are operating in the specific category under articles 5.4a, 5.5, or 5.5b of the EU regulation, additional oversight fees apply. For operations that fall under article 5.4a, that fee is SEK5,100 (about US$482), with an additional fee of SEK1,700 (about US$161) per license.85 For activities that fall under article 5.5, the fee is SEK5,100 (about US$482), with an additional fee of SEK2,300 (about US$217) per standard scenario.86 For activities that qualify under article 5.5b of the EU regulation, an annual fee of SEK54,000 (about US$5,106) is charged.87                                                                  74 Id. annex III, no. 37(a), (bb). 75 Id. annex VI, no. 34(a).  76 Id. annex III, no. 37(b). 77 Id. annex VI, no. 34(b). 78 Luftverkehrsgesetz [LuftVG], May 10, 2007, BGBl.

Certification/LicenseAll UAS operators who operate a drone with a take-off mass of 250g or more in the open category or any mass in the specific category must be registered in their Member State. For natural persons, the Member State is where they have their residence. For legal persons, it is where they have their principal place of business.88 A registration obligation for UAS operators also exists for drones of less than 250g if the drone is equipped with a sensor for recording personal data, such as a camera.89 After registration, the drone operator will receive a unique electronic registration number to be affixed to each drone.90 A drone operator may operate multiple drones under the registration number. In Germany, this registration is done online on the website of the German Federal Aviation Authority. Furthermore, for drones in the certified category, the UAS operator must obtain a type certification from the German Federal Aviation Authority.91 In France, UAS operators who operate a drone in the open category with a take-off mass of 250g or more, or with an impact energy of 80 joules or more, or which is equipped with a sensor for recording personal data, must register via an online portal called AlphaTango, which is managed by the DGAC.92 Operators of UAS in the certified category are subject to the same registration requirements, but must generally also obtain authorizations from the Directorate for Civil Aviation Security (Direction de la sécurité de l’aviation civile, DSAC).93 Exceptions whereby certified category operators do not need authorization from the DSAC include operations in a European STS-01 or STS-02 standard scenario, and some similar national standard scenarios.94 In Sweden, every operator in the open and specific categories must be registered with the Swedish Transport Agency, which costs SEK50 (about US$5).95 In addition, operators must pay an annual fee of SEK50 to remain in the registry.96 88 Implementing Regulation, art. 14, paras. 5, 6. 89 Id. art. 14, para. 5. 90 Id. art. 14, para. 6. 91 Luftverkehrs-Zulassungs-Ordnung [LuftVZO], June 19, 1964, BGBl.

Renewal Requirements  A. Open Category  The two different types of documents for remote pilots in the open category are both valid for five years and may be renewed by either retesting or by completing a refresher training.97 If the renewal takes place after the certificate has expired, the remote pilot must demonstrate his or her competency by completing an online training course followed by successfully completing an online theoretical knowledge examination or by completing the requirements for a certificate of remote pilot competency.98 If the renewal takes place within the validity period, the remote pilot may choose to either demonstrate his or her competencies or complete refresher training.99 There are no upper age limits.  B. Specific Category  There are no specific time limits for the validity of the operational authorization for UAS operators set out in the implementing regulation. The competent authority must specify the duration of the operational authorization in the authorization itself.100 However, the operational authorization remains valid only as long as the UAS operator remains compliant with the relevant requirements of the implementing regulation and with the conditions defined in the operational authorization.101 The operational declaration is valid for two years.102   The remote pilot certificates in STS-01 and STS-02 are both valid for five years.103 For a renewal after the expiration of the certificate, the remote pilot must demonstrate his or her competency by completing an online training course, passing the online theoretical knowledge examination, and passing an additional theoretical knowledge examination.104 If the remote pilot certificate is renewed within the validity period, the remote pilot may either demonstrate his or her competencies or complete a refresher training addressing the theoretical knowledge subjects.105  C. Certified Category  There are no specific provisions for renewals in the certified category. However, any national requirements for the renewal of pilot licenses would be applicable.                                                                97 Implementing Regulation, annex, pt.

Under the rules, Unmanned Aerial Vehicles are grouped in three categories (aeroplane, rotorcraft, and hybrid Unmanned Aerial System) and five classifications based on their maximum all-up (gross) weight. In order to obtain a remote pilot certificate, an applicant must complete a training program by an authorized remote pilot training organization specified by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation. The duration of courses varies depending on the category or classification of drones, but most drone training courses are short and can be completed in five to eight days. Within seven days of successfully completing the training and passing the tests, the authorized remote pilot training organization is required to submit an application for remote pilot certificate on the government’s online digital sky platform, providing details about the individual who has passed the test. That individual is issued a remote pilot certificate through the same digital sky platform.   I.  Introduction  In August 2021, the Ministry of Civil Aviation published the Drone Rules, 2021,1 which were issued under the authority of the Aircraft Act, 1934.2 These rules replaced the Unmanned Aircraft System Rules, 2021.3 The rules define “drone” as an “unmanned aircraft system.”4 An unmanned aircraft system (UAS) is defined as an “aircraft that can operate autonomously or can be operated remotely without a pilot on board.”5  According to the government, drones include “Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) or Remotely Piloted Aerial Systems (RPAS) that are controlled either by a pilot on the ground or with the help of technology.”6  Section 2 stipulates that these rules apply to  (a) all persons owning or possessing, or engaged in leasing, operating, transferring or maintaining an unmanned aircraft system in India;  (b) all unmanned aircraft systems that are registered in India; and                                                               1 Drone Rules, 2021, Gazette of India, pt.

They are grouped under three categories and five classifications. The categories are aeroplane,8 rotorcraft,9 and hybrid unmanned aircraft system,10 with the sub-categories remotely piloted aircraft system,11 model remotely piloted aircraft system,12 and autonomous unmanned aircraft system.13  A UAS is classified based on the “maximum all-up [gross] weight including payload”  (a) Nano unmanned aircraft system: weighing less than or equal to 250 grams;   (b) Micro unmanned aircraft system: weighing more than 250 grams, but less than or equal to 2 kilograms;  (c) Small unmanned aircraft system: weighing more than 2 kilograms, but less than or equal to 25 kilograms;   (d) Medium unmanned aircraft system: weighing more than 25 kilograms, but less than or equal to 150 kilograms; and   (e) Large unmanned aircraft system: weighing more than 150 kilograms.14  Part III of the rules deal with the type of certification of a UAS in terms of quality standards, testing, and safety features. On January 26, 2022, the Ministry of Civil Aviation published the Certification Scheme for Unmanned Aircraft Systems.15                                                               7 Drone Rules, 2021, r. 2. 8 Id. r. 3(1)(c), ”aeroplane“ means any power-driven heavier than air aircraft machine deriving support for its lift in flight chiefly from aerodynamic reactions on surfaces which remain fixed under given conditions of flight.  9 Id. r. 3(1)(x), “Rotorcraft” means a heavier-than-air aircraft supported in flight by the reactions of the air on one or more power driven rotors on substantially vertical axes. 10 Id. r. 3(1)(m), “hybrid unmanned aircraft” means a heavier-than-air unmanned aircraft capable of vertical take-off and landing which depends principally on power-driven lift devices or engine thrust for the lift during the flight regimes and on non-rotating airfoil for lift during horizontal flight. 11 Id. r. 3(1)(w), “remotely piloted aircraft system” means a remotely piloted aircraft, its associated remote pilot stations, the required command and control links and any other components as specified in the type design; “remotely piloted aircraft” means an unmanned aircraft that is piloted from a remote pilot station.  12 Id. r. 3(1)(n), “model remotely piloted aircraft system” means a remotely piloted aircraft system, with all-up weight not exceeding 25 kilograms, used for educational, research, design, testing or recreational purpose only and operated within visual line of sight. 13 Id. r. 3(1)(zb). 14 Drone Rules, 2021, r. 5.  15 Ministry Of Civil Aviation Notification, New Delhi, Certification Scheme for Unmanned Aircraft Systems, S.O. 347(E), Gazette of India, pt.

Training and Certification Process    A. Training Requirements  As noted in Section I above, the procedure for obtaining a remote pilot certificate includes a requirement to complete the training specified by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation (DGCA) for that specific category, sub-category, or classification of UAS. Training is only imparted by an “authorised remote pilot training organisation,”16 and “[n]o remote pilot training organisation shall be authorised [to] impart training unless it meets with the eligibility criteria as may be specified by the Director General.”17  The duration of courses varies depending on the category or classification of drones but most drone training courses are short and can be completed in five to eight days.   The syllabus for training and examination of remote pilots requires training organizations to give remote pilot training to any individual seeking a Cat-1 visual line-of-sight (VLOS) or Cat-2 beyond visual line-of-sight (BVLOS) Remote Pilot Certificate.18   The syllabus is divided into “Ground Class” and “Flying Class.” The duration of ground class for Cat-1 is broken down as follows:  a. Theory [Ground Class] – 2 Days  b. Practical [Flying Class including Simulator] – 3 - 6 Days  c. Total Cat-1 [Basic] Duration – 5 - 8 Days Approx.19  The duration of the Cat-2 syllabus is broken down as follows:   a. Theory [Ground Class] – 106 Hours Approx.  b. Practical [Flying Class including Simulator] – 44 Hours Approx.  c. Total Cat 2 [BVLOS] Hours – 150 Hours Approx.20  B. Testing   The procedure for obtaining a remote pilot certificate also requires passing the tests conducted by the authorized remote pilot training organization. After completing ground classes, the candidate takes a “theory test.” Passing that test leads to “flying training,” which ends with a “skill test.” A candidate who passes the skill test acquires a certificate.21                                                               16 Drone Rules, 2021, r. 37. 17 Id. r. 38.  18 DGCA, Drone Training Circular No. 02 of 2022, E-File No. DGCA-31018/3/2022-DRONE-Dte (Feb. 15 2022), https://perma.cc/B2E7-469N.  19 Id. at 2.  20 Id.  21 DGCA, Remote Pilot License Examination & Syllabus: Category 1, https://perma.cc/NZT3-JG9Q.  \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: India The Law Library of Congress 51 C.  Fees  According to news reports, the fee for a drone pilot training course “ranges between ₹30,000 [about US$37] and ₹1 lakh [about US$1,257], depending on the course.”22 In May 2022, the minister of Civil Aviation stated that fees for drone pilot training courses would decrease within the next three to four months as more training schools and institutes are certified.   Issuance or renewal of a remote pilot certificate costs 100 rupees (about US$1.25).23  D.  Certification/License/UAS Registration  The Drone (Amendment) Rules, 2022, were published on Feb. 11, 2022. Prior to the amendment, applicants were required to get a remote pilot certificate and a drone pilot license. The 2022 amendment has abolished the requirement to acquire a drone pilot license. The “remote pilot certificate issued by a DGCA-authorised drone school is adequate for operating drones.”24  An individual is eligible to obtain a remote pilot certificate if the individual  (a) is not less than eighteen years of age and not more than sixty-five years of age; (b) has passed class tenth examination or its equivalent from a recognised Board; and  (c) has successfully completed such training as may be specified by the Director General, from any authorised remote pilot training organisation.25   Part VI of the rules regulates acquiring a remote pilot certificate. Rule 31 has the general requirement that “[n]o individual other than a holder of a valid remote pilot certificate enlisted on the digital sky platform shall operate an unmanned aircraft system.”26 No remote pilot certificate is required, however, for “operating a nano unmanned aircraft system” or operating a “micro unmanned aircraft system for non-commercial purposes.”27  The Ministry of Civil Aviation has created the Digital Sky Platform,28 which it describes as a “unique unmanned traffic management (UTM) system” that facilitates online registration and certification of drones and operators “in addition to giving instant (online) clearances to operators for every flight.” The Digital Sky Platform enables online registration of pilots, devices, and                                                              22 Isha Sahai Bhatnagar, Cost of Training Drone Pilots Set to Reduce in Coming Days: Scindia, Hindustan Times (May 18, 2022), https://perma.cc/PG2G-29B4.  23 Drone Rules, 2021, r. 46. 24 Press Release, Ministry of Civil Aviation, Samvaad with Scindia: Minister of Civil Aviation Interacted with Farmers on Benefits and Challenges of Kisan; Drones Fees for Drone Pilot Training Course Will Decrease Within the Next 3-4 Months: Shri Scindia (May 17, 2022), https://perma.cc/ENT5-FGMR.  25 Drone Rules, 2021, r. 33. 26 Drone Rules, 2021, r. 31. 27 Id. r. 36.  28 Digital Sky: Interactive Airspace Maps, DGCA, https://digitalsky.dgca.gov.in/home.  \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: India The Law Library of Congress 52 service providers. Using a mobile app, an operator must request permission before operating a UAS. This is called NPNT (no permission, no take-off).29  A remote pilot certificate must “specifically mention the category, sub-category and classification” of the UAS, or a combination of these, for which it is issued.   Rule 34 of the rules stipulates the procedure for obtaining a remote pilot certificate  (1) Any individual, who desires to obtain a remote pilot certificate for any category, sub-category or class of an unmanned aircraft system, or a combination thereof, shall complete the training specified by the Director General for such category, sub-category or class, and pass the tests conducted by the authorised remote pilot training organisation. 30  Within seven days of successful completion of the training and passing of the tests, the authorized remote pilot training organization is required to make an application for remote pilot certificate on the digital sky platform, providing details of the individual who has passed the test.31 That individual will be issued a remote pilot certificate through the digital sky platform.32  Rule 14 also requires that “No person shall operate an unmanned aircraft system without first registering it on the digital sky platform and obtaining a unique identification number, unless exempted from the requirement of a unique identification number under these rules.”33  III.  Renewal Requirements  A certificate must be “renewed by the authorised remote pilot training organisation for such period as may be specified therein, subject to a maximum period of ten years.” The holder of the remote pilot certificate is required to undergo “such refresher course as may be specified by the Director General on the digital sky platform from time to time.”34 As stated in Section II.A. above, persons over 65 years of age cannot obtain a remote pilot certificate.                                                                29 Jagdish Kumar, India Opens the Sky for Drones Under the “No Permission, No Takeoff” (NPNT) System, Com.

Licensing requirements include being of the age of majority and having appropriate training, skills, knowledge, and professional experience in the specific type of drone. License applicants must successfully pass both written and practical tests. A license for commercial drone operation is valid for 24 months and may be extended for additional 24 months upon proof that the licensee has flown an aerial vehicle (a drone, or AV) of the same AV type for a period prescribed by the regulations. Maximum age limits do not appear to apply with regard to license renewal.    I.  Introduction  The Aviation Law, 5771-2011, regulates the safety and operation of aircraft in Israel.1 The law imposes licensing requirements on the commercial operation of aircraft, including those categorized as “aerial vehicles” (drones, or AVs).2   For the purpose of regulating AVs, the Aviation Law defines “commercial operation” as the operation of AVs, such as hang gliders, powered hang gliders, paragliders, powered paragliders, and powered parachutes,3 involving the transport of passengers or the providing of services.4  The law authorizes the minister of Transportation and Road Safety, with the approval of the Knesset Economic Affairs Committee, to determine the types of aircraft operation that require a license and the conditions for the issuance of a license. Among the conditions prescribed by regulations are being of the minimum age and having appropriate training, skills, knowledge, and professional experience. The regulations also detail the procedures for obtaining or renewing a license and the duration of licenses.5   The Aviation (Aerial Vehicles) Regulations 5775-2015 (AV regulations), issued under the authority prescribed by the law, set the requirements that apply to training in, and operation of, AVs.6 According to the regulations, license applicants must file an application with the licensing                                                              1 Aviation Law, 5771-2011, SH 5771 No. 2296 p. 830, as amended, available at Nevo Legal Database, https://perma.cc/R98H-8VD3 (in Hebrew, by subscription). 2 Id. § 87(b). 3 Id. § 1. 4 Id. § 85. 5 Id. § 88. 6 Aviation Regulations (Aerial Vehicles) 5775-2015 (AV Regulations), KT 5775 No. 7503 p. 1090, as amended, Nevo, https://perma.cc/HSE9-LK3Q (in Hebrew, by subscription). \fCommercial Drone Operation Training and Certification Requirements: Israel The Law Library of Congress 54 department of the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA)7 and attach the necessary documentation and receipt for payment of the relevant filing fees.8   II.

The 2021 amendment to the CAA introduced the unmanned aircraft operator licenses system. The license system will be effective in December 2022. There will be two kind of licenses: first class and second class. To obtain the license, a person must pass the physical examination, knowledge test, and practical trial test.    I.  Introduction  Flights of unmanned aircrafts are mainly regulated by the Civil Aeronautics Act (CAA).1 In addition, they are also governed by the Act Prohibiting Unmanned Aircrafts’ Flights over Important Facilities and Surrounding Areas, which also regulates flight areas.2 The Radio Wave Act3 requires a radio station license if the device on an unmanned aircraft uses a system for transmitting data, depending on the capacity of data transmission. Further, the operator of an unmanned aircraft with a radio device must have certain qualifications.4   The CAA defines unmanned aircrafts as airplanes, helicopters, gliders, airships, and other equipment specified by government ordinances that are available for aviation use, that cannot be boarded by humans due to their structure, and that can be flown by remote control or automatic operation based on programs.5 Since June 20, 2022, the CAA has required the registration of unmanned aircrafts which weigh 100 grams (3.53 oz)6 or more.7 They are also subject to the flight permission system.8 The CAA was amended in 2021 to introduce certifications of unmanned                                                              1 Civil Aeronautics Act (CAA), Act No. 231 of 1952, as amended by Act No. 61 of 2020. 2 Act Prohibiting Unmanned Aircrafts’ Flights over Important Facilities and Surrounding Areas, Act No. 9 of 2016, as amended by Act No. 61 of 2020, https://perma.cc/78WY-L79Q (in Japanese).

The 2021 CAA amendment states that the Minister of MLIT will certify the skills required to fly an unmanned aircraft in certain conditions upon application by issuing an unmanned aircraft operation license.12 There will be two kinds of licenses: the first class license and the second-class license.13 These are general licenses, not commercial licenses. Only licensed unmanned aircraft operators will be permitted to operate certified unmanned aircrafts in the following airspaces:  (a) airspaces in which unmanned aircrafts are likely to affect the safe operation of aircraft14(b) airspaces which are above a densely populated area15The MLIT ordinance specifies part (a), which includes •airspaces above airports and their vicinity;•airspaces designated by the MLIT to secure the safety of aircraft used by the MLIT and otheradministrative organs for rescue work during emergencies, and•airspaces which are 150 meters above ground or water surface level16In addition, only licensed unmanned aircraft operators will be permitted to operate certified unmanned aircrafts when one or more of the following operational conditions are not satisfied:   9 Act to Partially Amend CAA, Act No. 65 of 2021, https://perma.cc/FZZ3-AD2D (in Japanese). 10 Id.

The second class license holder will need to take measures to limit people’s access to the area below the flight area when he or she operates an unmanned aircraft in the above area and/or without one or more of the above-listed conditions.19 For such flights, a flight permit will be required before the operation.20 The Minister of MLIT may add conditions to the license, such as limiting the kinds of unmanned aircrafts to be operated or adding additional operational conditions.21 Currently, unmanned aircraft flight not satisfying all above conditions and/or in the above areas is generally prohibited.22  III. Training & Certification ProcessThe MLIT will give unmanned aircrafts operator licenses to persons who pass a physical examination, knowledge test, and practical trial test.23 To take the tests, a fee is required.24 A person who has not reached 16 years of age cannot apply for the exams.

The Court has set out a two-part test to determine whether legislation imposes an unconstitutional burden on this freedom. The second part of the test, which involves considering whether the burden imposed on the freedom is “reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end” in a manner consistent with the maintenance of representative and responsible government, has resulted in diverging approaches among the High Court justices. One approach involves the application of a structured proportionality analytical framework, using a “compatibility test” to evaluate whether the purpose of the law and the means it adopts are “legitimate.” An alternative view is that the standard of review should vary depending on the nature and extent of the burden, with laws that do not pose a significant risk to representative government needing only to be “rationally related” to the pursuit of a legitimate end. The law is unsettled and is likely to be discussed further in future cases.   I.  Introduction  Although the Australian Constitution does not contain a bill of rights, the High Court of Australia (Australia’s highest court) has held that Australia’s common law recognizes certain rights and freedoms. This report discusses the origins of the freedom of political communication in Australian law. First, it distinguishes between common law rights held by individuals and freedoms that the High Court has held to arise by implication from the Australian Constitution’s text and structure. The former are held by Australian citizens and are not constitutionally entrenched, while the latter restrict the exercise of legislative and executive power. Although Australian cases have recognized a common law right to free speech,1 political speech only receives constitutional protection through the operation of the freedom of political communication.   After explaining how common law rights evolve through Australian case law, this report traces the origins of the freedom of political communication. It then outlines the competing approaches that justices of the High Court of Australia have taken to analyzing whether an impugned law                                                  1 See Tajjour v New South Wales (2014) 254 CLR 508, 548 (French CJ); [2014] HCA 35, https://perma.cc/W8F9-PAWA.  \fAustralia: Implied Constitutional Freedom of Political Communication The Law Library of Congress 2 infringes upon the freedom of political communication. It concludes by observing that the analytical framework known as “structured proportionality” likely will continue to be debated by High Court judges in future cases concerning the freedom of political communication.  II.  Australian Common Law  To understand how common law rights evolve through Australian case law, it is necessary to appreciate the singularity of Australia’s common law. Australian common law differs from the common law in the United States in that Australia has a unified body of common law.2 The High Court’s 1997 decision in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority confirmed that “[t]here is but one common law in Australia which is declared by this Court as the final court of appeal.”3 While in practice state supreme courts sometimes take different approaches to applying identical rules, it is erroneous to think of each state as having its own body of common law, and the High Court will harmonize the common law applied by state supreme courts.4 State supreme court decisions form part of Australia’s unified body of common law, which evolves incrementally over time through the judgments of Australian courts.5  III.  Individual Rights in Australian Common Law  Australian case law recognizes certain rights that are often referred to as “common law rights.”6 To emphasize the point, the former Chief Justice of Australia, Hon. Robert French, described the common law “as a repository of rights and freedoms.”7 Indeed, the High Court has recognized several rights that are held by Australian citizens. However, these rights are not protected by the Australian Constitution.8 They can be modified or extinguished by Parliament, subject to the                                                  2 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 563, https://perma.cc/A6BJ-9CXV. See also Kable v Director of Public Prosecutions (1996) 189 CLR 51, 139 (Gummow J), https://perma.cc/UT9V-ZKB6. For more discussion on the nature of Australia’s common law system, see Leslie Zines, The Common Law in Australia: Its Nature and Constitutional Significance (2004) 32 Fed. L. Rev. 337, https://perma.cc/2ZMS-ZSKQ.  3 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 563. 4 See e.g. IMM v The Queen (2016) 257 CLR 300; [2016] HCA 14, https://perma.cc/L8EG-GCWG. In this case, the High Court addressed the different approaches taken by the Supreme Court of New South Wales and the Supreme Court of Victoria to the interpretation of section 137 of the Evidence Act 1995 (Cth). Note that in Farah Constructions v Say-Dee (2007) 230 CLR 89, 151-2; [2007] HCA 22, https://perma.cc/ML5T-3JY8, the High Court said that “intermediate appellate courts and trial judges in Australia should not depart from decisions in intermediate appellate courts in another jurisdiction on the interpretation of Commonwealth legislation or uniform national legislation unless they are convinced that the interpretation is plainly wrong.”  5 See e.g. Hon. Robert French, Speech to the Anglo Australasian Lawyers Society, Sydney: The Common Law and the Protection of Human Rights 2 (Sept. 4, 2009), https://perma.cc/G3TU-TZ6V.  6 See J.J. Doyle, Common Law Rights and Democratic Rights, in 1 Essays on Law and Government: Principles and Values 144, 147 (PD Finn ed., 1995). 7 French, supra note 5, at 3. 8 Constitution of Australia, https://perma.cc/9HR6-C3QD. This is a significant difference between the Australian Constitution and the American Constitution. The American Constitution, particularly in the Bill of Rights and later amendments, entrenches certain rights that cannot be extinguished by Congress and the states. The Australian Constitution does not entrench personal rights held by Australians. \fAustralia: Implied Constitutional Freedom of Political Communication The Law Library of Congress 3 limitations placed on Parliament by the Constitution. Some common law rights that have been recognized by Australian courts include the right to access courts and the right to legal representation when accused of a serious crime.9  IV.  Freedom of Speech in Australia  The contrast between common law rights and constitutionally protected freedoms is a crucial distinction in Australian law. As explained below, the High Court has interpreted the Australian Constitution to give rise to a freedom to communicate on political matters.   The question of whether freedom of speech is, in fact, a common law right in Australia is not easy to answer. In a book on free speech in Australia, Sir Gerard Brennan, the former Chief Justice of Australia, made the following point:  There is no common law right to free speech which trumps other legal rights but there is a general freedom of speech because of the common law principle that ‘everybody is free to do anything, subject only to the provisions of the law.’10  Another former Chief Justice, Hon. Robert French, later observed that freedom of speech has “long enjoyed special recognition at common law.”11 However, freedom of speech in Australia is a common law right that can be modified or extinguished by Parliament. As Professor Dan Meagher points out, Australian courts deploy an extensive set of statutory interpretation principles to analyze whether a statute abrogates freedom of speech.12 But this report is concerned with a different issue—the extent to which freedom of speech receives constitutional protection in Australian law. As demonstrated below, speech only receives constitutional protection to the extent it is protected by the implied freedom of political communication.   V.  Freedom of Political Communication  The High Court has recognized as implicit in the text and structure of the Australian Constitution a freedom to communicate on political matters.13 However, this right is not personal in nature.14 Rather, the freedom of political communication operates as a structural limitation on the exercise                                                  9 French, supra note 5, at 3. 10 Michael Chesterman, Freedom of Speech in Australian Law: A Delicate Plant vii (2000) (citation omitted).  11 Tajjour v New South Wales (2014) 254 CLR 508, 548 (French CJ). 12 Dan Meagher, Is There a Common Law ‘Right’ to Freedom of Speech?, 43 Melbourne U. L. Rev. 269 (2019), https://perma.cc/YE63-N4GX.  13 The freedom of political communication was recognized by a unanimous High Court in Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520. It was also referred to in Australian Capital Television [ACTV] v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 138 (Mason CJ), 150 (Brennan J), 169 (Deane and Toohey JJ), 214 (Gaudron J), and 227 (McHugh J), https://perma.cc/N5LF-N3BC, and in Nationwide News v Willis (1992) 177 CLR 1, 5 (Brennan J), https://perma.cc/YR9V-7JGT.  14 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 560. The High Court has restated this point on several occasions. See the explanation given in Unions New South Wales v New South Wales (2013) 252 CLR 530, 554; [2013] HCA 58, https://perma.cc/3DD3-G3ZM.  \fAustralia: Implied Constitutional Freedom of Political Communication The Law Library of Congress 4 of legislative power by Australian federal and state parliaments and on the exercise of executive power.15 In that sense, this right differs from the freedom of speech guaranteed by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The American right to freedom of speech is personal in nature; it includes the right not to speak,16 the right to use offensive words and phrases to convey political messages,17 and the right to engage in symbolic speech.18  In Lange, a unanimous judgment of the High Court of Australia reasoned that, because sections 7 and 24 of the Constitution require that members of the federal Parliament are chosen by the people,19 and section 128 ensures that the Constitution cannot be altered except by a referendum,20 the Australian Constitution provides for a system of “representative government” in which people in free elections choose their representatives.21 That system is only effective if Australians exercise a “free and informed choice”22 at elections, which necessarily requires electors to be free to communicate on politics with their representatives and with one another.  Prior to the decision in Lange, judges on the High Court seemed to disagree on whether the freedom emanates from the system of representative government for which the Constitution provides, or from the words “directly chosen by the people” contained within sections 7 and 24                                                  15 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 560-1. The comments of Justice McHugh in Levy v Victoria (1997) 189 CLR 579, 622, https://perma.cc/A2DS-7MN9, explain this point: The freedom protected by the Constitution is not, however, a freedom to communicate. It is a freedom from laws that effectively prevent members of the Australian community from communicating with each other about political and government matters relevant to the system of representative and responsible government provided for by the Constitution. Unlike the Constitution of the United States, our Constitution does not create rights of communication. It gives immunity from the operation of laws that inhibit a right or privilege to communicate political and government matters. 16 See West Virginia Board of Education v. Barnette, 319 U.S. 624 (1943). 17 See Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15 (1971). 18 See Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S. 397 (1989); United States v. Eichman, 496 U.S. 310 (1990). 19 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 560-1. 20 Id. 21 Id. 22 Id. at 560. \fAustralia: Implied Constitutional Freedom of Political Communication The Law Library of Congress 5 of the Constitution.23 The Court in Lange favored the latter view.24  Irrespective of its origin, the existence of the freedom of political communication in Australian constitutional law is widely accepted by High Court justices.25 The basis for this right was explained by Chief Justice Mason in the 1992 ACTV v Commonwealth decision, in which he emphasized the importance of freedom of communication in representative government, and quoted the former Solicitor General of the United States, Archibald Cox:   only by uninhibited publication can the flow of information be secured and the people informed concerning men, measures, and the conduct of government. . . . Only by freedom of speech, of the press, and of association can people build and assert political power, including the power to change the men who govern them.26   The plurality in the Court’s decisions in Unions New South Wales27 and McCloy28 endorsed the above passage.                                                     23 In ACTV v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 232, Justice McHugh tied the freedom directly to the text and structure of the Australian Constitution. Rather than considering what was required by the implication of representative government, Justice McHugh looked at sections 7 and 24 of the Australian Constitution, which establish elections for the House of Representatives and the Senate, and argued that these provisions require that “the people have a constitutional right to convey and receive opinions, arguments and information concerning matter intended or likely to affect voting in an election for the Senate or the House of Representatives.” There is a subtle difference between this approach and the approach favored by Chief Justice Mason and Justice Gaudron in ACTV. Their Honors each found that the Constitution entrenched representative and responsible government, which in turn gave rise to the freedom of political communication. See ACTV v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 138-140 (Mason CJ), 211-12 (Gaudron J). See also the judgment of Justices Deane and Toohey in Nationwide News v Willis (1992) 177 CLR 1, 72. For more discussion on this point, see Adrienne Stone, The Limits of Constitutional Text and Structure: Standards of Review and the Freedom of Political Communication, 23 Melbourne U. L. Rev. 688 (1999), https://perma.cc/Q3VR-3L3A.  24 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 566-7:  [T]he Constitution gives effect to the institution of ”representative government” only to the extent that the text and structure of the Constitution establish it. . . . [T]he relevant question is not, ”What is required by representative and responsible government?” It is, ”What do the terms and structure of the Constitution prohibit, authorize or require?” 25 The one exception to this point is Justice Steward’s judgment in the 2021 decision Libertyworks v Commonwealth [2021] HCA 18, https://perma.cc/DEN4-H5W6. At paragraph 249, Justice Steward said:  it is arguable that the implied freedom does not exist. It may not be sufficiently supported by the text, structure and context of the Constitution and, because of the continued division within this Court about the application of the doctrine of structured proportionality, it is still not yet settled law. Other High Court justices have not endorsed this view in recent freedom of political communication cases. See McCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178, 217; [2015] HCA 34, https://perma.cc/2MNU-DVQV, in which the plurality states that “the constitutional basis for the freedom is well settled.” 26 ACTV v Commonwealth (1992) 177 CLR 106, 139 (Mason CJ), quoting Archibald Cox, The Court and the Constitution 212 (1987). 27 Unions New South Wales v New South Wales (2013) 252 CLR 530, 551. 28 McCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178. \fAustralia: Implied Constitutional Freedom of Political Communication The Law Library of Congress 6 A.  The Original Test in Lange  This part of the report explains the test the High Court set out in Lange, and then describes two ways in which that test has been interpreted by current justices on the High Court.  In Lange, the Court set out a two-part test to determine whether legislation imposes an unconstitutional burden on the freedom of political communication. The two-part test proceeds in the following steps:  1. Does the legislative provision burden communication on governmental or political matters?29  2. If the provision imposes such a burden, it will only be valid if it is “reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end”30 in a manner that is consistent with the maintenance of the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government.31  While application of the first prong has been straightforward, High Court justices have taken diverging approaches to the second element. While the approach of each High Court justice is beyond the scope of this report, it will outline the approaches of the McCloy plurality and of Justice Gageler.   The plurality introduces a structured proportionality analytical framework to address the second element of the Lange test, a mode of analysis that had not previously been used in Australian constitutional law. Although the High Court has previously utilized proportionality as a tool for analyzing whether legislative and executive law-making powers have been exceeded,32 the structured proportionality analysis expounded by the plurality in McCloy was new in the constitutional law context.                                                  29 Lange v Australian Broadcasting Authority (1997) 189 CLR 520, 567. 30 Id. 31 See Coleman v Power (2004) 220 CLR 1, 51; [2004] HCA 39, https://perma.cc/TX3D-VQ6P; Wotton v Queensland (2012) 246 CLR 1, 15; [2012] HCA 2, https://perma.cc/P2SR-KVBL. See also Hogan v Hinch (2011) 243 CLR 506, 542 (French CJ), 555-556 (Gummow, Hayne, Heydon, Crennan, Kiefel and Bell JJ); [2011] HCA 4, https://perma.cc/XY8G-WKTT.  32 See the comment of Chief Justice French in A-G (South Australia) v Adelaide City Corporation (2013) 249 CLR 1, 37; [2013] HCA 3, https://perma.cc/2MVG-59BB:   Proportionality is not a legal doctrine. In Australia it designates a class of criteria used to determine the validity or lawfulness of legislative and administrative action by reference to rational relationships between purpose and means, and the interaction of competing legal rules and principles, including qualifications of constitutional guarantees, immunities or freedom. See also the following comment of Chief Justice French in Tajjour (2014) 254 CLR 508, 548, in which His Honor refers to the 1988 case of Davis v Commonwealth (1988) 166 CLR 79: Davis, antedating by four years the Court’s discernment of the implied freedom of political communication, suggests that a proportionality test, relevant to the constitutional validity of any purposive legislative power, including an incidental power, may involve consideration of the effect of the purported exercise of that power upon common law rights and freedoms. See also McCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178, 195. \fAustralia: Implied Constitutional Freedom of Political Communication The Law Library of Congress 7  Justice Gageler’s approach serves as a counterpoint to the McCloy plurality; it questions whether structured proportionality is an appropriate analytical tool for evaluating whether legislation infringes upon the freedom of political communication.   B.  The Plurality Approach in McCloy  The plurality’s approach to the second question in Lange contains several elements. After answering the first question—whether the law effectively burdens the implied freedom—, the court turns to the second question’s first component. That requires the court to undertake a “compatibility test” to consider whether the purpose of the law and the means it adopts are “legitimate.”33 The law will pass this test if the law is compatible with the maintenance of representative government in that it does not compromise the system’s ability to function.34  If the law is compatible with representative government, the court then must undertake a three-step proportionality test.35 The first step is known as “suitability,” which requires the court to determine whether the law has a rational connection to the legitimate purpose.36   The second step, known as “necessity,” requires the court to determine whether there are any “obvious” or “compelling” measures which are reasonably practicable and equally effective at achieving the legitimate purpose, but which impose a less onerous restriction on the implied freedom.37   The third step is known as “balancing.”38 This requires the court to determine whether the importance of the legitimate purpose and the benefits of its achievement outweigh the detriment caused by the restriction of the freedom.39   To sum up the plurality’s approach: if the law is compatible with representative government, suitable, necessary and adequate in balance, it will be held valid even though it burdens the implied freedom of political communication.                                                     33 McCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178, 193-196. 34 Id. 35 Id. 36 Id. at 195, 211, 217, 170.

The Approach of Justice Gageler  Justice Gageler’s analysis of the second Lange question also begins with looking at whether the law imposes a meaningful or effective burden on the implied freedom.40 After this, the court is to determine whether the purpose of the law is legitimate in the sense that it is consistent with the constitutionally prescribed system of representative and responsible government.41   The third step of Justice Gageler’s test requires the court to determine whether the law pursues its purpose in a manner “consistent with the preservation of the integrity of the system of representative and responsible government.”42 The standard of review that the court applies in this stage should vary depending on the nature and extent of the burden the law imposes on political speech.43 In Tajjour, Justice Gageler said that this part of the test creates a “spectrum”44 of scrutiny under which the standard of review is more exacting if the degree of risk posed by the law to the system of representative and responsible government increases.45 Laws that do not pose a significant risk to that system of government need only be “rationally related”46 to the pursuit of a legitimate end.  VI.  Concluding Points  This report explained the difference between the common law right to free speech and the constitutionally implied freedom of political communication. It also demonstrated that the analytical approach of the High Court of Australia to working out whether the freedom of political communication has been infringed by legislation is unsettled.   The approach taken by the plurality to step two of the Lange test is noteworthy because it was influenced by proportionality tests that have been developed in Germany, the United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, New Zealand, and the European Union.47 The appropriateness of structured                                                  40 Id. at 222-234 (Gageler J). 41 Id. “Responsible government” is described in  a quote in Justice Gageler’s judgment by Sir Samuel Griffith, one of the drafters of the Australian Constitution:  The system called Responsible Government is based on the notion that the head of the State can himself do no wrong, that he does not do any act of State of his own motion, but follows the advice of his ministers, on whim the responsibility for acts done, in order to give effect to their volition, naturally falls.” (Id. at 224 (quoting Samuel Griffith, Notes on Australian Federation: Its Nature and Probably Effects 17 (1897), as quoted in Quick & Garran, The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth 704 (1901)).) 42 McCloy v New South Wales (2015) 257 CLR 178, 233 (Gageler J). 43 Id. 44 Tajjour v New South Wales (2014) 254 CLR 508, 545 (Gageler J). 45 Id. 46 Id. 47 Mark Watts, Reasonably Appropriate and Adapted?

There is an extensive body of academic writing on the extent to which the plurality’s structured proportionality analysis draws on judgments from courts in other jurisdictions.

See also Shipra Chordia, \fAustralia: Implied Constitutional Freedom of Political Communication The Law Library of Congress 9 proportionality for analyzing whether legislation infringes the freedom of political communication was debated by justices on the High Court of Australia this year. In Libertyworks Inc v Commonwealth,48 the structured proportionality analysis garnered the support of more recently appointed judges, Justice Edelman49 and Justice Gleeson.50 However, as Justice Steward pointed out, this approach “it is still not yet settled law.”51 The precedential value of the majority’s structured proportionality analysis in McCloy is likely to come under further scrutiny in future freedom of political communication cases in the High Court.

In both jurisdictions, environmental law refers to the area of law concerning environmental protection. In general, environmental law focuses on the main areas of clean air, clean water, the conservation of species, and the preservation of natural resources. This report addresses clean air and water as well as aspects of national environmental governance and international environmental cooperation in each country.   I.  Introduction  The United States (US) Constitution establishes a federal system of governance in which a legal relationship and distribution of powers exists between the federal government and the state governments.1 Legislation and regulations may be implemented at the federal and state level to ensure the protection of the environment. This report discusses legislative developments, regulatory developments, and court rulings from the three branches of the federal government.   The most notable pieces of relevant federal legislation are the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA),2 which establishes the broad national framework for protecting the environment, the Clean Air Act (CAA),3 which governs air pollution, and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act—also known as the Clean Water Act (CWA),4 which is the principal law governing water pollution. It should be noted that the federal government has one primary agency that specializes in the protection of the environment, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  While the US has a federal system of governance, the United Kingdom (UK) is a constitutional monarchy with a parliament that has devolved certain areas of the law to Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. In previous years, the UK was a member of the European Union (EU). This meant that, where the EU had been given authority via treaties, EU law had supremacy over the law of the UK. This report discusses the aftermath of the UK’s exit from the EU and its                                                  1 U.S. Const. art.

II.  US Environmental Laws  Since the 1960s, modern US environmental laws have transformed the extent to which the environment has been afforded protection. As noted in Part I above, these include NEPA, CAA, and CWA.  NEPA was one of the first laws to establish a broad national framework for protecting the environment.8 Title I of NEPA contains a Declaration of National Environmental Policy, which requires the federal government to use all practicable means to create and maintain conditions under which humans and nature can exist in productive harmony.9 Section 102 requires all federal agencies to incorporate environmental considerations in their planning and decision making by preparing detailed statements assessing the environmental impact of, and alternatives to, federal actions.10 Title II of NEPA established the President’s Council on Environmental Quality to oversee NEPA’s implementation.11  Initially titled the Air Pollution Control Act, the CAA was the first federal legislation involving air pollution.12 The CAA was designed by Congress to protect human health and the environment from emissions that pollute ambient or outdoor air.13 The CAA requires the EPA to establish national ambient air quality standards for certain common and widespread pollutants based on the latest science.14 Congress established much of the CAA’s basic structure in 1970 and made major revisions in 1977 and 1990. Congress has amended the CAA since 1990.                                                   5 Environment Act 2021, c. 30, https://perma.cc/4NXG-DA5F. 6 Id. pts. 4-5. 7 Id. § 11(1-2). 8 Summary of the National Environmental Policy Act, EPA (Sept. 28, 2021), https://perma.cc/49LE-3NZ8. 9 National Environment Act of 1969 § 101.  10 Id. § 102. 11 Id. §§ 204-209. 12 Clean Air Act Requirements and History, EPA (Aug. 10, 2022), https://perma.cc/892X-2YXW. 13 Id. 14 CAA §§ 7408–7410. \fUnited States and United Kingdom: Comparative Recent Developments in Environmental Law The Law Library of Congress 3 The CWA is the principal law governing the basic structure for regulating discharges of pollutants into the waters of the United States and quality standards for surface waters.15 It was originally enacted in 1948 and significantly amended in 1972. The 1972 amendments created ambitious programs for water quality improvement that have since been expanded via regulations. Congress has also made amendments to the CWA since 1972.  A.  Air Quality Legal Developments  The CAA regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The law authorizes the EPA to regulate power plants by setting a “standard of performance” for their emission of certain pollutants into the air.16 This “standard of performance” may be different for new or existing power plants, but in each case, it must reflect the “best system of emission reduction” (BSER) that the agency has determined to be “adequately demonstrated” for the particular category of power plant.17   Since the passage of the CAA, the EPA has exercised its authority by setting performance standards based on measures that would reduce pollution by causing plants to operate more cleanly.18 Specifically, the CAA establishes three main regulatory programs to control air pollution from stationary sources such as power plants. The programs are the New Source Performance Program under section 111,19 the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS),20 and the Hazardous Air Pollutants program (HAP).21   The New Source Performance Standard program of section 111 directs the EPA to list categories of stationary sources that it determines cause or significantly contribute to air pollution that may reasonably be anticipated to “endanger public health or welfare.” Section 111(b) focuses on promulgating, for each category, federal standards of performance for new sources. Section 111(d), often referred to as the “gap filler,” authorizes the regulation of certain pollutants from existing sources.22  Under Section 111(d), once the EPA has set new source standards addressing emissions of a particular pollutant under section 111(b),23 it must then address emissions of that same pollutant                                                  15 Summary of the Clean Water Act, EPA (July 6, 2022), https://perma.cc/7CPC-3MYZ. 16 CAA § 7411. 17 Id. §§ 7411(a)(1), (b)(1), (d). 18 W.

Reg. 64711 (Oct. 23, 2015), https://perma.cc/833P-8GRX [hereinafter Carbon Pollution Emission Guidelines]. \fUnited States and United Kingdom: Comparative Recent Developments in Environmental Law The Law Library of Congress 4 by existing sources, but only if they are not already regulated under the NAAQS or HAP programs.24  The NAAQS program addresses air pollutants that may reasonably be anticipated to endanger public health and welfare resulting from numerous or diverse mobile or stationary sources.25 The EPA establishes a standard for each pollutant that represents the “maximum airborne concentration of the pollutant that public health can tolerate.”26 The HAP program targets pollutants, other than those covered by NAAQS, which represent a threat of adverse human effects, including substances known or anticipated to be “acutely or chronically toxic.”27 The EPA here directly requires all sources to reduce their emissions to a certain level.  In 2015, the EPA issued the Clean Power Plan (CPP),28 which established emission guidelines for states to follow in limiting carbon dioxide emissions from existing power plants. The CPP was based on the conclusion that the “best system of emission reduction” for existing coal-fired power plants includes a requirement that such facilities either reduce their own production of electricity or subsidize increased generation by natural gas, wind, or solar sources.29 This change from higher-emitting to lower-emitting producers of electricity is referred to as “generation shifting.”30 For authority, the agency cited section 111 of the CAA.  1.  West Virginia v. EPA  In 2016, parties challenging the CPP in the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) successfully petitioned the US Supreme Court for a stay of enforcement of the rule while the merits of the case were considered by the lower court.31 Although the D.C. Circuit heard arguments, it did not issue a decision before a change in presidential administrations.   In 2019, the EPA repealed the CPP, concluding it did not have authority to issue generation-shifting measures because, under the “major questions doctrine,” it lacked a clear statement from the US Congress delegating authority to regulate a fundamental sector of the economy. Instead, it issued the Affordable Clean Energy (ACE) rule, which required a combination of equipment upgrades and improved operating practices but would lead to only minor reductions of carbon dioxide emissions.32                                                   24 CAA § 7411(d)(1). 25 CAA § 7408(a)(1). 26 W.

Circuit, and other parties defending the repeal intervened. That court determined that the EPA’s repeal of the CPP rested on the mistaken reading of the CAA, finding to the contrary that generation shifting can be a system of emission reduction under section 111, and that the major questions doctrine does not apply. It vacated the repeal and replacement of the CPP and remanded to the agency for further consideration.33  The parties defending the repeal of the Clean Power Plan petitioned the Supreme Court for certiorari, which granted the petitions and consolidated the cases in West Virginia v. EPA.34   In a 6:3 decision authored by Chief Justice John Roberts, the Supreme Court held that, although capping carbon dioxide emissions at a level that forces a nationwide transition away from coal to generate electricity may be sensible to solve the climate crisis, it is not plausible that Congress gave the EPA the authority to adopt on its own such a regulatory scheme under section 111.35 A “decision of such magnitude and consequence” rests with Congress itself or an agency under its clear delegation, Roberts wrote.36   Relying on the major questions doctrine, the majority opinion stated, “[T]here are extraordinary cases . . . in which the history and the breadth of the authority that the agency has asserted and the economic and political significance of that assertion, provide a reason to hesitate before concluding that Congress meant to confer such authority.”37  Before 2015, the opinion noted, the EPA had always set emissions limits under section 111 based on the application of measures that would reduce pollution by causing the regulated source to operate more cleanly.38 It had never devised a cap by looking to a “system” that would reduce pollution simply by “shifting” polluting activity “from dirtier to cleaner sources.”39 The EPA acknowledged that understanding areas such as electricity transmission requires policy or technical expertise not traditionally needed in EPA regulatory development, but asserted that Congress had tasked it alone under section 111(d) to decide how Americans get their energy.40 The Court said it had “little reason” to presume Congress would task the EPA with such decisions when it has no comparative expertise.41                                                     33 Am.

Other Recent Air Quality Legal Developments  A bill “to require the Administrator of the EPA to revise certain ethylene oxide emissions standards under the Clean Air Act” has been introduced in the US Senate.42 A similar bill has been introduced in the US House of Representatives.43 Specifically, if enacted, either bill’s provisions would require that regulations be revised based on results from the National Center for Environmental Assessment report titled Evaluation of the Inhalation Carcinogenicity of Ethylene Oxide.44   B.  Water Quality Legal Developments  1.  Definition of the “Waters of the United States” Under the CWA   The 1972 amendments to the CWA established federal jurisdiction over “navigable waters,” defined in the act as the “waters of the United States, including the territorial seas.”45 The CWA does not define “waters of the United States”; rather, it provides discretion to the EPA and the US Army Corps of Engineers (Corps) to define “waters of the United States” in regulations.  2.  US Supreme Court Decisions on “Waters of the United States” Before 2022  Three US Supreme Court decisions before 2022 addressed the definition and scope of “waters of the United States.” In 1985, the Court in United States v. Riverside Bayview Homes, Inc.,46 deferred to the US Army Corps of Engineers’’ assertion that CWA jurisdiction extended to certain wetlands that were adjacent to other jurisdictional waters because they were “inseparably bound up” with navigable waters. In 2001, the Court in Solid Waste Agency of Northern Cook County v. U.S. Army Corps of Engineers rejected the Corps’ claim of federal jurisdiction over non-navigable and isolated ponds as lacking sufficient connection to traditional navigable waters.47   The Court most recently interpreted the term “waters of the United States” in Rapanos v. United States in 2006.48 A four-justice plurality opinion articulated by Justice Antonin Scalia held that the term “navigable waters” under the CWA includes only relatively permanent or flowing bodies of water, not intermittent or ephemeral flows of water.49 Additionally, only those wetlands with a continuous surface connection to bodies that are waters of the United States in their own right                                                  42 S. 1903, 117th Cong.

Executive Branch Initiatives to Redefine “Waters of the United States”  In 2015, the EPA and the Corps (hereinafter “the agencies”) adopted the Clean Water Rule,54 revising “the existing definition of ‘waters of the United States’ consistent with the CWA, science, the agencies’ technical expertise and experience, and Supreme Court decisions.”55  On June 9, 2021, the agencies announced their intent to revise the definition of “waters of the United States” to better protect the “nation’s vital water resources that support public health, environmental protection, agricultural activity, and economic growth.”56 The EPA highlighted the necessity of revisions after reviewing the Navigable Waters Protection Rule (NWPR)57 as directed by President Joseph R. Biden Jr.58 Specifically, EPA Administrator Michael S. Regan stated, “the EPA and Department of the Army have determined that this rule is leading to significant environmental degradation.”59  On August 30, 2021, the US District Court for the District of Arizona issued an order vacating and remanding the NWPR in the case of Pascua Yaqui Tribe v. U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.60                                                  50 Id. at 717. 51 Id. at 779-80. 52 Id. 53 Kevin M. Lewis, Cong. Rsch.

The public comment period on the proposed rule closed on February 7, 2022.65  Specifically, the EPA and the Corps propose to interpret the term “waters of the United States” to include   traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, and the territorial seas, and their adjacent wetlands; most impoundments of “waters of the United States”; tributaries to traditional navigable waters, interstate waters, the territorial seas, and impoundments, that meet either the relatively permanent standard or the significant nexus standard; wetlands adjacent to impoundments and tributaries, that meet either the relatively permanent standard or the significant nexus standard; and “other waters” that meet either the relatively permanent standard or the significant nexus standard.66  Most recently, on February 24, 2022, the agencies announced the selection of 10 roundtables that highlight geographical differences and a range of perspectives, including agricultural and environmental organizations and communities with environmental justice concerns.67   On January 24, 2022, the US Supreme Court granted certiorari in part to the petitioners in Sackett v.

Sept. 22, 2021), https://perma.cc/5L5A-CEW2. \fUnited States and United Kingdom: Comparative Recent Developments in Environmental Law The Law Library of Congress 9 set forth the proper test for determining whether wetlands are “waters of the United States” under the CWA.69   In Sackett, the petitioners purchased a soggy residential lot near Idaho’s Priest Lake in 2004. After preparing the lot for construction, they received an administration compliance order from the EPA stating that the property was subject to wetland protection under the CWA and that the property must be restored to its natural state. Subsequently, the landowners sued, contending the EPA’s jurisdiction does not extend to their property.70  The Ninth Circuit held there was substantial evidence to support the EPA’s conclusions that the lot contained wetlands sharing a significant nexus with the lake. Although the landowners sought to rely on Justice Scalia’s plurality opinion,71 the Ninth Circuit Court’s holding rested on its prior decision in Northern California River Watch v. City of Healdsburg, which held Justice Kennedy’s concurrence was the controlling rule of law.72 Therefore, applying Justice Kennedy’s ruling, the court was satisfied with the EPA’s conclusion, as the record showed the wetlands on the landowner’s property were adjacent to a jurisdictional tributary and, together with the similarly situated Kalispell Bay Fen, possessed a significant nexus to Priest Lake, a traditional navigable water.73  The Congressional Research Service has noted that the EPA’s recent proposed rule to redefine the definition of “waters of the United States” may be affected by the ruling in Sackett, depending on its time or scope. Therefore, the holding in Sackett has the potential to affect how the agencies will shape their regulations.74  C.  US International Environmental Cooperation  1.  Rejoining the Paris Agreement  On April 22, 2016, the US committed to a legally binding international treaty, the Paris Agreement.75 The agreement aims to ensure that signatories commit to and participate in the global response to climate change. This includes holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and limiting the temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.76                                                   69 Sackett v.

Trump made the decision to withdraw the US from the Paris Agreement, asserting that pledges made under the agreement imposed an unfair economic burden on American workers, businesses, and taxpayers.77 Following this decision, the US faced pressure from the international community, including during a United Nations Human Rights Council periodic review in 2020.78 However, on January 20, 2021, just hours after being sworn in, President Biden announced that the US would rejoin the Paris Agreement.79 In keeping with the Paris Agreement, the US has issued its Nationally Determined Contribution to Reduce Greenhouse Gases.80  2.  The Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing Alliance  President Biden has described illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing and related harmful fishing practices as being among “the greatest threats to ocean health” and a significant cause of global overfishing.81 The president stated that, left unchecked, IUU fishing and associated labor abuses undermine US economic competitiveness, national security, fisheries sustainability, and the livelihoods and human rights of fishers around the world and will exacerbate the environmental and socioeconomic effects of climate change.82  Consequently, on June 27, 2022, Biden signed a National Security Memorandum (NSM) to address IUU fishing and related harmful fishing practices.83 The NSM directs the launch of an IUU Fishing Action Alliance that will include the US, UK, and Canada.84 The IUU Fishing Action Alliance is aimed at increasing ambition and momentum in the fight against IUU fishing, including a pledge to take urgent action to improve the monitoring, control, and surveillance of fisheries; increase transparency in fishing fleets and the seafood market; and build new partnerships that will hold bad actors accountable.85                                                   77 Press Statement, Secretary of State Michael R.

Collaboration Between the UK and the US on Air Quality Research.  A research collaboration on air quality between the UK and US has been initiated in recognition of the health, welfare, and economic impacts of atmospheric pollution and, in particular, the problems from ground-level ozone, fine particles, acid deposition, global climate change, eutrophication, mercury, and other toxic air contaminants.86 The bodies included in the research collaboration are the EPA and the UK Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs as well as the Environment Agency for England and Wales.87   The goal of the collaboration is to coordinate air quality research efforts and develop high quality scientific products and modeling tools that will support sound environmental policy decisions in the US and the UK.88 The collaboration also allows each nation to improve its scientific understanding of the nature and magnitude of the problem of airborne pollution and its consequences.89   In particular, the collaboration proposes research on exposure science in environmental and public health decision-making to improve its use in regulatory applications.90 Moreover, the collaboration proposes the development, evaluation, and application of air quality modeling tools with an emphasis on a community multi-scale air quality model to aid environmental decision making.91 The bodies will meet once a year to review the research accomplished and plan for future activities to conduct collaborative scientific research.92   III.  Recent United Kingdom Environmental Law Developments  A.  Effect of Withdrawal from the European Union  The term “Brexit,” short for “British Exit,” refers to the UK’s withdrawal of its membership in the EU.   Prior to the UK’s exit from the EU, a significant proportion of environmental legislation in the UK originated from EU law or was required to comply with EU legislation. Following the 2016 EU referendum, the UK voted to leave the EU and triggered the withdrawal process under article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union (TEU). Article 50 of the TEU provides the mechanism necessary for the withdrawal of a country from the EU.93 The current impact of the UK’s final exit from the EU on January 1, 2021, regarding the development of environmental law means that                                                  86 Collaboration with the United Kingdom on Air Quality Research, EPA (Sept. 9, 2022), https://perma.cc/2HMW-X3MD.  87 Id. 88 Id. 89 Intent to Collaborate, EPA (Oct. 7, 2008), https://perma.cc/8DWH-EHYC.  90 Id. 91 Id. 92 Id. 93 Treaty of the European Union, art. 50, July 29, 1992, O.J.

The Environment Act 2021  On November 9, 2021, following a long approval process in the UK’s Parliament (hereinafter Parliament), the Environment Act 2021 gained royal assent.95 Described by former Environment Secretary George Eustice as delivering the “most ambitious environmental programme of any country on earth,” the Environment Act 2021 is intended to operate as a new framework to enhance and protect the environment.96  Following “Brexit,” environmental protections were a subject of concern, since EU laws no longer applied, however, in the UK/EU Trade and Cooperation Agreement, a part of BREXIT negotiations, required the UK to maintain a level of environmental protections equivalent to the protections in force on December 31, 2020.97. New legislation relating to environmental areas such as water and clean air needed to be established. In approving the Environment Act 2021, environmental protections became enshrined into law, and the legislation provides for the creation of new powers.98 The Environment Act 2021 has eight sections. Specifically, parts 1 and 2 concern environmental protections, while parts 3 through 7 concern waste and resource efficiency, air quality, water, nature and biodiversity, and conservation covenants. Part 8 includes miscellaneous provisions such as chemical regulation.   This report focuses on the act’s key features concerning environmental governance, water, and air quality.   C.  Environmental Governance  1.  Environmental Targets   Part 1 of the Environment Act 2021 includes the creation of legally binding environmental targets.  a.  Long-Term Targets  The Environment Act 2021 stipulates that the secretary of State may create regulations to set long-term targets relating to any matters concerning the natural environment or people’s enjoyment                                                  94 Dep’t for Exiting the European Union, Information About the UK Leaving the EU, Gov.uk (Mar. 1, 2017) https://www.gov.uk/government/news/information-about-the-uk-leaving-the-eu.  95 Environment Act 2021 c. 30. The Environmental Act 2021 applies differently across the different regions of the United Kingdom; some parts apply to England and Wales, others to Northern Ireland, and some to Scotland. This report focuses only on those provisions applicable to England. 96 Press Release, Dep’t. of Env’t., Food & Rural Aff. et al., World-leading Environment Act Becomes Law (Nov. 10, 2022), https://www.gov.uk/government/news/world-leading-environment-act-becomes-law.  97 Trade and Cooperation Agreement between the European Union and the European Atomic Energy Community, of the one part, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, of the other part, 2021 O.J. (L 149) 10. https://perma.cc/LG7R-LZD8. 98 Id. \fUnited States and United Kingdom: Comparative Recent Developments in Environmental Law The Law Library of Congress 13 of the natural environment.99 The secretary must set long-term targets regarding at least one matter within each “priority area.”100 For the purposes of the act, the phrase “priority areas” refers to air quality, water, biodiversity as well as resource efficiency, and waste reduction.101 “Long-term” for the purposes of the Environment Act 2021 is no less than 15 years after the date on which the target was initially set.102   b.  Specialized Targets  Other targets in the Environment Act 2021 relate to particulate matter and species abundance.  According to the Environment Act 2021, the secretary of State must set targets by regulations with respect to the annual mean amount of PM 2.5 in ambient air.103 “PM 2.5” for the purposes of the act is specified as particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter not exceeding 2.5 micrometers.104 The particulate matter target is in addition to the long-term priority area targets; therefore, the long-term target for air quality should not be neglected.105   The secretary of State must also set targets by regulation regarding the abundance of species.106 December 31, 2021, was the deadline for the release of this target under the act.107 The species abundance target is not a long-term target and is in addition to the long-term priority area target for biodiversity.108  c.  Other Provisions  A draft of a statutory instrument containing each of the priority area targets, PM 2.5 targets, and species abundance target must be laid before Parliament by October 31, 2022.109  The secretary of State must also review the targets set.110 The purpose of review is to consider whether the “significant improvement test” has been fulfilled.111 To satisfy this test, it must be                                                  99 Environment Act 2021 § 1(1). 100 Id. § 1(2). 101 Id. § 1(3). 102 Id. § 1(6). 103 Id. § 2(1). 104 Id. § 2(3). 105 Id. § 2(5). 106 Id. § 3(1). 107 Id. § 3(2). 108 Id. § 3(3). 109 Id. § 5. 110 Id. § 7(1). 111 Id. § 7(2). \fUnited States and United Kingdom: Comparative Recent Developments in Environmental Law The Law Library of Congress 14 shown that the targets set would significantly improve the natural environment in England to satisfy the “significant improvement test.”112   After conducting the review, the secretary of State must publish and submit a report to Parliament regarding whether significant improvements have occurred, whether the “significant improvement test” has been met, and if not, what steps will be taken to ensure this test is met.113 The first review deadline is January 31, 2023.114   2.  Environmental Improvement Plans  Part 1 of the Environment Act 2021 specifies that the secretary of State must prepare an environmental improvement plan covering a period of no less than 15 years and sets out how the UK government will significantly improve the natural environment during the plan’s timeframe.115 The environment improvement plan must also include how the UK government intends to improve people’s enjoyment of the natural environment.116   The UK government published the document titled “A Green Future: Our 25-Year Plan to Improve the Environment” on January 11, 2018. This document is to be treated as the UK’s current and first environmental protection plan.117 Specifically, this environmental improvement plan sets out the government’s policy focus on six key areas, including “using and managing land sustainably” as well as outlining its 25-year goals such as clean air.118   The secretary of State must review the current environmental improvement plan by January 31, 2023.119 All reviews of the environment improvement plan must be revised by the secretary of State to set at least one interim target in respect to each relevant matter.120   3.  Creation of the Office for Environmental Protection   The Office for Environmental Protection (OEP) is a new public body created under the Environment Act 2021.121 As the EU previously held the UK to account on environmental matters, creation of the OEP was necessary following Brexit to ensure that the UK government and public                                                  112 Id. § 7(3).

The Environment Act stipulates that the principal objective of the OEP in exercising its functions is to contribute to environmental protection and the improvement of the natural environment.122 Specifically, the OEP must act objectively, impartially, and with regard to the need to act proportionally and transparently.123   The OEP must prepare a strategy that, among other specifications, includes how it intends to exercise its functions,124 how it intends to further its principal objective, and how it will act objectively and impartially.125 The OEP must arrange for its strategy to be laid before Parliament and published.126   D.  Water  Part 5 of the Environment Act 2021 relates to water and establishes new duties for individuals such as the secretary of State and sewerage undertakers. This report focuses on the key features of the Environment Act’s storm overflows and water quality provisions.   1.  Storm Overflows  The Environment Act 2021 amends part 4 of the Water Industry Act 1991 on sewerage services by inserting a new chapter, chapter 4, on storm overflows.127   a.  Storm Overflow Discharge Reduction Plan   Section 141A of chapter 4 stipulates that the secretary of State must prepare a storm overflow discharge reduction plan (SODRP).128 The SODRP must focus on reducing discharges from storm overflows of sewerage undertakers whose area is wholly or mainly in England.129 “Reducing discharges” refers to reducing the frequency, duration, and volume of discharges.130 In addition, the SODRP must focus on the reduction of the discharge’s adverse impact.131 “Adverse impact” refers to reducing the negative impact of storm overflow discharges upon the environment and                                                  122 Id. § 23(1). 123 Id. § 23(2). 124 Id. § 23(3). 125 Id. § 23(4). 126 Id. § 24(1). 127 Environment Act 2021, c. 30, § 80 (inserting ch. 4, § 141A into pt.

Progress Reports on Storm Overflow Discharge Reduction Plan  Section 141B of chapter 4 specifies that the secretary of State must publish progress reports relating to the SODRP.136 Each progress report must contain the secretary’s assessment of progress made in implementing proposals during the report’s time frame and the effect that progress had on the SODRP’s focuses.137 The first progress report must relate to the three years following Section 141A’s publication,138 and it must be laid before Parliament once published.139  c.  Environment Agency Reports and Annual Reports on Discharges from Storm Overflows   Sections 141C and 141D of chapter 4 provide that the Environment Agency as well as the sewerage undertaker whose area is wholly or mainly England must publish annual reports in relation to the undertaker’s storm overflows.140  The Environment Agency report must specify the location of storm overflows, the watercourse, body of water or underground strata into which the storm discharges as well as the frequency and duration of discharges from the storm overflow to which the period of the report relates.141 The report must also specify, when the information is available, the volume of discharge during the report’s set time period.142 This report must be published before April 1 in the year after the calendar year to which it relates or in such a manner as the Environmental Agency sees fit.143   The specifications in sewerage undertakers’ reports are the same as those in Environmental Agency reports. However, they have an additional specification to include information on any                                                  132 Id. § 141A(3). 133 Id. § 141A(4). 134 Id. § 141A(5). 135 Id. § 141A(6). 136 Id. § 141B(1). 137 Id. § 141B(2). 138 Id. § 141B(3). 139 Id. § 141B(6). 140 Id. §§ 141C-D. 141 Id. § 141D(2). 142 Id.  143 Id. § 141B(4). \fUnited States and United Kingdom: Comparative Recent Developments in Environmental Law The Law Library of Congress 17 investigations that have taken place or improvement works undertaken to improve storm overflow during the report period.144 The storm overflow annual report must relate to successive calendar years, starting in 2021, and be published by the sewerage undertaker before April 1 in the year after the calendar year to which it relates.145 In addition, the Environment Act 2021 specifically requires that the annual storm overflow report conducted by the sewerage undertaker be in a form accessible and understandable to the public.146  d. Report on Elimination of Discharges from Storm Overflow   The secretary of State must prepare a report on actions needed to eliminate discharges from the storm overflows of sewerage undertakers whose area is mainly England along with the cost and benefit of those actions.147 The secretary must publish this report before September 1, 2022, and lay the report before Parliament once published.148   2.  Water Quality: Powers of the Secretary of State   Part 5, section 89 of the Environment Act 2021 states that the secretary of State may, by regulations, amend or modify legislation to make provisions about substances to be considered in assessing the chemical status of surface water or groundwater.149 The secretary of State may also amend regulations to specify standards in relation to those substances or in relation to the chemical status of surface water or groundwater.150  Legislation for the purpose of this section includes:  • The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017.151 • The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (Northumbria River Basin District) Regulations 2003.152                                                  144 Id. § 141C(2). 145 Id. § 141C(4). 146 Id. § 141C(5) 147 Environment Act 2021, c. 30, § 84(1).  148 Id. § 84(2-3). 149 Id. § 89(1). 150 Id. 151 Water Environment (Water Directive) (England and Wales) Regulations 2017, S.I. 2017/407, https://perma.cc/9AMX-MQEU. 152 Water Environment (Water Directive) (Northumbria River Basin District) 2003, S.I. 2003/3245, https://perma.cc/72TK-SFZF. \fUnited States and United Kingdom: Comparative Recent Developments in Environmental Law The Law Library of Congress 18 • The Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (Solway Tweed River Basin District) Regulations 2004.153  Before making regulations, the secretary of State must consult authorities depending on the individuals affected by the regulation. For instance, if the regulation applies to England, the Environment Agency must be consulted.154   Welsh ministers and the Northern Ireland department receive powers identical to those of the secretary of State.155 The only difference concerns with whom they must consult before making regulations. For instance, Welsh ministers must consult the natural resources body for Wales, among other authorities.156   E.  Air Quality  Part 4 of the Environment Act 2021 concerns Air Quality and the powers of the secretary of State. This report discusses the key features of the environmental recall of motor vehicles and other developments within this legal area.   1.  Environmental Recall of Motor Vehicles   Section 74 of the Environment Act 2021 stipulates that the secretary of State may, by regulation, make provisions for, about, or connected to the recall of “relevant products” that do not meet “relevant environmental standards.”157  “Relevant product” refers to a product specified by the regulations.158 Only the following types of vehicles may be specified or described in regulations:  (a) a mechanically propelled vehicle; (b) a part of a mechanically propelled vehicle; (c) an engine that is, or forms part of, machinery that is transportable (including by way of self-propulsion); (d) a part of such an engine, or any other part of such machinery that is connected with the operation of the engine.159                                                   153 Water Environment (Water Framework Directive) (Solway Tweed River Basin District) 2004, S.I. 2004/99, https://perma.cc/4DM3-HQLJ.
