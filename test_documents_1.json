We frame it as an inference problem ona graph. Mentions of entities are nodes of thisgraph while edges encode relations betweendifferent mentions (e.g., within- and cross-document coreference). Graph convolutionalnetworks (GCNs) are applied to these graphsand trained to perform multi-step reasoning.Our Entity-GCN method is scalable and com-pact, and it achieves state-of-the-art results ona multi-document question answering dataset,WIKIHOP (Welbl et al., 2018).1IntroductionThe long-standing goal of natural language under-standing is the development of systems which canacquire knowledge from text collections. Fresh in-terest in reading comprehension tasks was sparkedby the availability of large-scale datasets, such asSQuAD (Rajpurkar et al., 2016) and CNN/DailyMail (Hermann et al., 2015), enabling end-to-endtraining of neural models (Seo et al., 2016; Xionget al., 2016; Shen et al., 2017). These systems,given a text and a question, need to answer thequery relying on the given document. Recently,it has been observed that most questions in thesedatasets do not require reasoning across the doc-ument, but they can be answered relying on in-formation contained in a single sentence (Weis-senborn et al., 2017).The last generation oflarge-scale reading comprehension datasets, suchas a NarrativeQA (Kocisky et al., 2018), Trivi-aQA (Joshi et al., 2017), and RACE (Lai et al.,2017), have been created in such a way as to ad-dress this shortcoming and to ensure that systemsquery: country Thorildsplan candidates: {Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Italy, ...} answer: Sweden Thorildsplan is a small park in Kristineberg in  Stockholm, named in 1925 after the writer [..]Stockholm is the capital of Sweden  and the most populous city in [..]Figure 1: A sample from WIKIHOP where multi-stepreasoning and information combination from differentdocuments is necessary to infer the correct answer.relying only on local information cannot achievecompetitive performance.Even though these new datasets are challeng-ing and require reasoning within documents, manyquestion answering and search applications re-quire aggregation of information across multipledocuments. The WIKIHOP dataset (Welbl et al.,2018) was explicitly created to facilitate the devel-opment of systems dealing with these scenarios.Each example in WIKIHOP consists of a collec-tion of documents, a query and a set of candidateanswers (Figure 1). Though there is no guaran-tee that a question cannot be answered by relyingjust on a single sentence, the authors ensure that itis answerable using a chain of reasoning crossingdocument boundaries.Though an important practical problem, themulti-hop setting has so far received little at-tention.The methods reported by Welbl et al.(2018) approach the task by merely concatenat-ing all documents into a single long text and train-ing a standard RNN-based reading comprehen-sion model, namely, BiDAF (Seo et al., 2016)and FastQA (Weissenborn et al., 2017).Docu-ment concatenation in this setting is also used inWeaver (Raison et al., 2018) and MHPGM (Baueret al., 2018).The only published paper which\f2307goes beyond concatenation is due to Dhingraet al. (2018), where they augment RNNs withjump-links corresponding to co-reference edges.Though these edges provide a structural bias, theRNN states are still tasked with passing the infor-mation across the document and performing multi-hop reasoning.Instead, we frame question answering as aninference problem on a graph representing thedocument collection. Nodes in this graph corre-spond to named entities in a document whereasedges encode relations between them (e.g., cross-and within-document coreference links or simplyco-occurrence in a document). We assume thatreasoning chains can be captured by propagat-ing local contextual information along edges inthis graph using a graph convolutional network(GCN) (Kipf and Welling, 2017).The multi-document setting imposes scalabil-ity challenges.In realistic scenarios, a systemneeds to learn to answer a query for a given col-lection (e.g., Wikipedia or a domain-speciﬁc setof documents). In such scenarios one cannot af-ford to run expensive document encoders (e.g.,RNN or transformer-like self-attention (Vaswaniet al., 2017)), unless the computation can be pre-processed both at train and test time.Even if(similarly to WIKIHOP creators) one considers acoarse-to-ﬁne approach, where a set of potentiallyrelevant documents is provided, re-encoding themin a query-speciﬁc way remains the bottleneck. Incontrast to other proposed methods (e.g., (Dhingraet al., 2018; Raison et al., 2018; Seo et al., 2016)),we avoid training expensive document encoders.In our approach, only a small query encoder,the GCN layers and a simple feed-forward an-swer selection component are learned.Insteadof training RNN encoders, we use contextualizedembeddings (ELMo) to obtain initial (local) rep-resentations of nodes.This implies that only alightweight computation has to be performed on-line, both at train and test time, whereas the restis preprocessed. Even in the somewhat contrivedWIKIHOP setting, where fairly small sets of can-didates are provided, the model is at least 5 timesfaster to train than BiDAF.1 Interestingly, whenwe substitute ELMo with simple pre-trained wordembeddings, Entity-GCN still performs on par1When compared to the ‘small’ and hence fast BiDAFmodel reported in Welbl et al. (2018), which is 25% less ac-curate than our Entity-GCN. Larger RNN models are prob-lematic also because of GPU memory constraints.with many techniques that use expensive question-aware recurrent document encoders.Despite not using recurrent document encoders,the full Entity-GCN model achieves over 2% im-provement over the best previously-published re-sults. As our model is efﬁcient, we also reportedresults of an ensemble which brings further 3.6%of improvement and only 3% below the humanperformance reported by Welbl et al. (2018). Ourcontributions can be summarized as follows:• we present a novel approach for multi-hopQA that relies on a (pre-trained) documentencoder and information propagation acrossmultiple documents using graph neural net-works;• we provide an efﬁcient training techniquewhich relies on a slower ofﬂine and a fasteron-line computation that does not require ex-pensive document processing;• we empirically show that our algorithm is ef-fective, presenting an improvement over pre-vious results.2MethodIn this section we explain our method. We ﬁrstintroduce the dataset we focus on, WIKIHOPby Welbl et al. (2018), as well as the task ab-straction. We then present the building blocks thatmake up our Entity-GCN model, namely, an en-tity graph used to relate mentions to entities withinand across documents, a document encoder usedto obtain representations of mentions in context,and a relational graph convolutional network thatpropagates information through the entity graph.2.1Dataset and Task AbstractionDataThe WIKIHOP dataset comprises of tuples⟨q, Sq, Cq, a⋆⟩where: q is a query/question, Sq isa set of supporting documents, Cq is a set of candi-date answers (all of which are entities mentionedin Sq), and a⋆∈Cq is the entity that correctlyanswers the question. WIKIHOP is assembled as-suming that there exists a corpus and a knowledgebase (KB) related to each other. The KB containstriples ⟨s, r, o⟩where s is a subject entity, o an ob-ject entity, and r a unidirectional relation betweenthem. Welbl et al. (2018) used WIKIPEDIA as cor-pus and WIKIDATA (Vrandeˇci´c, 2012) as KB. TheKB is only used for constructing WIKIHOP: Welbl\f2308et al. (2018) retrieved the supporting documentsSq from the corpus looking at mentions of subjectand object entities in the text. Note that the set Sq(not the KB) is provided to the QA system, and notall of the supporting documents are relevant for thequery but some of them act as distractors. Queries,on the other hand, are not expressed in natural lan-guage, but instead consist of tuples ⟨s, r, ?⟩wherethe object entity is unknown and it has to be in-ferred by reading the support documents. There-fore, answering a query corresponds to ﬁnding theentity a⋆that is the object of a tuple in the KB withsubject s and relation r among the provided set ofcandidate answers Cq.TaskThe goal is to learn a model that can iden-tify the correct answer a⋆from the set of support-ing documents Sq.To that end, we exploit theavailable supervision to train a neural network thatcomputes scores for candidates in Cq. We estimatethe parameters of the architecture by maximizingthe likelihood of observations. For prediction, wethen output the candidate that achieves the high-est probability. In the following, we present ourmodel discussing the design decisions that enablemulti-step reasoning and an efﬁcient computation.2.2Reasoning on an Entity GraphEntity graphIn an ofﬂine step, we organize thecontent of each training instance in a graph con-necting mentions of candidate answers within andacross supporting documents. For a given queryq = ⟨s, r, ?⟩, we identify mentions in Sq of the en-tities in Cq ∪{s} and create one node per mention.This process is based on the following heuristic:1. we consider mentions spans in Sq exactlymatching an element of Cq ∪{s}. Admit-tedly, this is a rather simple strategy whichmay suffer from low recall.2. we use predictions from a coreference reso-lution system to add mentions of elements inCq ∪{s} beyond exact matching (includingboth noun phrases and anaphoric pronouns).In particular, we use the end-to-end corefer-ence resolution by Lee et al. (2017).3. we discard mentions which are ambiguouslyresolved to multiple coreference chains; thismay sacriﬁce recall, but avoids propagatingambiguity.Figure 2: Supporting documents (dashed ellipses) or-ganized as a graph where nodes are mentions of ei-ther candidate entities or query entities. Nodes with thesame color indicates they refer to the same entity (ex-act match, coreference or both). Nodes are connectedby three simple relations: one indicating co-occurrencein the same document (solid edges), another connect-ing mentions that exactly match (dashed edges), and athird one indicating a coreference (bold-red line).To each node vi, we associate a continuous an-notation xi ∈RD which represents an entity inthe context where it was mentioned (details in Sec-tion 2.3). We then proceed to connect these men-tions i) if they co-occur within the same document(we will refer to this as DOC-BASED edges), ii)if the pair of named entity mentions is identical(MATCH edges—these may connect nodes acrossand within documents), or iii) if they are in thesame coreference chain, as predicted by the exter-nal coreference system (COREF edges). Note thatMATCH edges when connecting mentions in thesame document are mostly included in the set ofedges predicted by the coreference system. Hav-ing the two types of edges lets us distinguish be-tween less reliable edges provided by the coref-erence system and more reliable (but also moresparse) edges given by the exact-match heuristic.We treat these three types of connections as threedifferent types of relations. See Figure 2 for anillustration. In addition to that, and to prevent hav-ing disconnected graphs, we add a fourth type ofrelation (COMPLEMENT edge) between any twonodes that are not connected with any of the otherrelations. We can think of these edges as thosein the complement set of the entity graph with re-spect to a fully connected graph.Multi-stepreasoningOurmodelthenap-proaches multi-step reasoning by transformingnode representations (Section 2.3 for details)with a differentiable message passing algorithmthat propagates information through the entity\f2309graph.The algorithm is parameterized bya graph convolutional network (GCN) (Kipfand Welling, 2017), in particular, we employrelational-GCNs (Schlichtkrull et al., 2018), an ex-tended version that accommodates edges of differ-ent types. In Section 2.4 we describe the propaga-tion rule.Each step of the algorithm (also referred to asa hop) updates all node representations in parallel.In particular, a node is updated as a function ofmessages from its direct neighbours, and a mes-sage is possibly speciﬁc to a certain relation. Atthe end of the ﬁrst step, every node is aware of ev-ery other node it connects directly to. Besides, theneighbourhood of a node may include mentionsof the same entity as well as others (e.g., same-document relation), and these mentions may haveoccurred in different documents. Taking this idearecursively, each further step of the algorithm al-lows a node to indirectly interact with nodes al-ready known to their neighbours. After L layers ofR-GCN, information has been propagated throughpaths connecting up to L + 1 nodes.We start with node representations {h(0)i }Ni=1,and transform them by applying L layers of R-GCN obtaining {h(L)i}Ni=1. Together with a rep-resentation q of the query, we deﬁne a distributionover candidate answers and we train maximizingthe likelihood of observations. The probability ofselecting a candidate c ∈Cq as an answer is thenP(c|q, Cq, Sq) ∝exp\u0012maxi∈Mc fo([q, h(L)i])\u0013,(1)where fo is a parameterized afﬁne transforma-tion, and Mc is the set of node indices such thati ∈Mc only if node vi is a mention of c. Themax operator in Equation 1 is necessary to selectthe node with highest predicted probability since acandidate answer is realized in multiple locationsvia different nodes.2.3Node AnnotationsKeeping in mind we want an efﬁcient model, weencode words in supporting documents and in thequery using only a pre-trained model for contex-tualized word representations rather than trainingour own encoder. Speciﬁcally, we use ELMo2 (Pe-ters et al., 2018), a pre-trained bi-directional lan-2The use of ELMo is an implementation choice, and, inprinciple, any other contextual pre-trained model could beused (Radford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018).guage model that relies on character-based inputrepresentation. ELMo representations, differentlyfrom other pre-trained word-based models (e.g.,word2vec (Mikolov et al., 2013) or GloVe (Pen-nington et al., 2014)), are contextualized sinceeach token representation depends on the entiretext excerpt (i.e., the whole sentence).We choose not to ﬁne tune nor propagate gradi-ents through the ELMo architecture, as it wouldhave deﬁed the goal of not having specializedRNN encoders. In the experiments, we will alsoablate the use of ELMo showing how our modelbehaves using non-contextualized word represen-tations (we use GloVe).Documents pre-processingELMo encodingsare used to produce a set of representations{xi}Ni=1, where xi ∈RD denotes the ith candidatemention in context. Note that these representa-tions do not depend on the query yet and no train-able model was used to process the documents sofar, that is, we use ELMo as a ﬁxed pre-trained en-coder. Therefore, we can pre-compute representa-tion of mentions once and store them for later use.Query-dependent mention encodingsELMoencodings are used to produce a query represen-tation q ∈RK as well. Here, q is a concatena-tion of the ﬁnal outputs from a bidirectional RNNlayer trained to re-encode ELMo representationsof words in the query. The vector q is used to com-pute a query-dependent representation of mentions{ˆxi}Ni=1 as well as to compute a probability distri-bution over candidates (as in Equation 1). Query-dependent mention encodings ˆxi = fx(q, xi) aregenerated by a trainable function fx which is pa-rameterized by a feed-forward neural network.2.4Entity Relational Graph ConvolutionalNetworkOur model uses a gated version of the originalR-GCN propagation rule.At the ﬁrst layer, allhidden node representation are initialized with thequery-aware encodings h(0)i= ˆxi. Then, at eachlayer 0 ≤ℓ≤L, the update message u(ℓ)ito theith node is a sum of a transformation fs of the cur-rent node representation h(ℓ)iand transformationsof its neighbours:u(ℓ)i= fs(h(ℓ)i ) +1|Ni|Xj∈NiXr∈Rijfr(h(ℓ)j ) , (2)\f2310where Ni is the set of indices of nodes neighbour-ing the ith node, Rij is the set of edge annotationsbetween i and j, and fr is a parametrized func-tion speciﬁc to an edge type r ∈R. Recall theavailable relations from Section 2.2, namely, R ={DOC-BASED, MATCH, COREF, COMPLEMENT}.A gating mechanism regulates how much of theupdate message propagates to the next step. Thisprovides the model a way to prevent completelyoverwriting past information. Indeed, if all neces-sary information to answer a question is present ata layer which is not the last, then the model shouldlearn to stop using neighbouring information forthe next steps. Gate levels are computed asa(ℓ)i= σ\u0010fa\u0010[u(ℓ)i , h(ℓ)i ]\u0011\u0011,(3)where σ(·) is the sigmoid function and fa aparametrized transformation. Ultimately, the up-dated representation is a gated combination of theprevious representation and a non-linear transfor-mation of the update message:h(ℓ+1)i= φ(u(ℓ)i ) ⊙a(ℓ)i+ h(ℓ)i⊙(1 −a(ℓ)i ) , (4)where φ(·) is any nonlinear function (we usedtanh) and ⊙stands for element-wise multiplica-tion. All transformations f∗are afﬁne and they arenot layer-dependent (since we would like to useas few parameters as possible to decrease modelcomplexity promoting efﬁciency and scalability).3ExperimentsIn this section, we compare our method against re-cent work as well as preforming an ablation studyusing the WIKIHOP dataset (Welbl et al., 2018).See Appendix A in the supplementary material fora description of the hyper-parameters of our modeland training details.WIKIHOPWe use WIKIHOP for training, val-idation/development and test. The test set is notpublicly available and therefore we measure per-formance on the validation set in almost all ex-periments.WIKIHOP has 43,738/ 5,129/ 2,451query-documents samples in the training, valida-tion and test sets respectively for a total of 51,318samples. Authors constructed the dataset as de-scribed in Section 2.1 selecting samples with agraph traversal up to a maximum chain length of3 documents (see Table 1 for additional datasetstatistics).WIKIHOP comes in two versions, aMinMaxAvg.Median# candidates27919.814# documents36313.711# tokens/doc.42,046100.491Table 1: WIKIHOP dataset statistics from Welbl et al.(2018): number of candidates and documents per sam-ple and document length.standard (unmasked) one and a masked one. Themasked version was created by the authors to testwhether methods are able to learn lexical abstrac-tion. In this version, all candidates and all men-tions of them in the support documents are re-placed by random but consistent placeholder to-kens. Thus, in the masked version, mentions arealways referred to via unambiguous surface forms.We do not use coreference systems in the maskedversion as they rely crucially on lexical realizationof mentions and cannot operate on masked tokens.3.1ComparisonIn this experiment, we compare our Enitity-GCN against recent prior work on the sametask.We present test and development re-sults (when present) for both versions of thedataset in Table 2.From Welbl et al. (2018),we list an oracle based on human performanceas well as two standard reading comprehensionmodels, namely BiDAF (Seo et al., 2016) andFastQA (Weissenborn et al., 2017). We also com-pare against Coref-GRU (Dhingra et al., 2018),MHPGM (Bauer et al., 2018), and Weaver (Rai-son et al., 2018). Additionally, we include resultsof MHQA-GRN (Song et al., 2018), from a recentarXiv preprint describing concurrent work. Theyjointly train graph neural networks and recurrentencoders. We report single runs of our two bestsingle models and an ensemble one on the un-masked test set (recall that the test set is not pub-licly available and the task organizers only reportunmasked results) as well as both versions of thevalidation set.Entity-GCN (best single model without coref-erence edges) outperforms all previous work byover 2% points. We additionally re-ran BiDAFbaseline to compare training time: when using asingle Titan X GPU, BiDAF and Entity-GCN pro-cess 12.5 and 57.8 document sets per second, re-spectively. Note that Welbl et al.

All models are trained onthe same dataset splits with different weight ini-tializations. The ensemble prediction is obtainedas arg maxc5Qi=1Pi(c|q, Cq, Sq) from each model.3.2Ablation StudyTo help determine the sources of improvements,we perform an ablation study using the publiclyavailable validation set (see Table 3).We per-form two groups of ablation, one on the embed-ding layer, to study the effect of ELMo, and oneon the edges, to study how different relations af-fect the overall model performance.Embedding ablationWe argue that ELMo iscrucial, since we do not rely on any other contextencoder. However, it is interesting to explore howour R-GCN performs without it. Therefore, in thisexperiment, we replace the deep contextualizedembeddings of both the query and the nodes withGloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) vectors (insensi-tive to context). Since we do not have any compo-nent in our model that processes the documents,we expect a drop in performance. In other words,in this ablation our model tries to answer questions3Besides, we could not run any other method we com-pare with combined with ELMo without reducing the dimen-sionality further or having to implement a distributed version.without reading the context at all. For example, inFigure 1, our model would be aware that “Stock-holm” and “Sweden” appear in the same documentbut any context words, including the ones encod-ing relations (e.g., “is the capital of”) will be hid-den. Besides, in the masked case all mentions be-come ‘unknown’ tokens with GloVe and thereforethe predictions are equivalent to a random guess.Once the strong pre-trained encoder is out of theway, we also ablate the use of our R-GCN com-ponent, thus completely depriving the model frominductive biases that aim at multi-hop reasoning.The ﬁrst important observation is that replacingELMo by GloVe (GloVe with R-GCN in Table 3)still yields a competitive system that ranks farabove baselines from (Welbl et al., 2018) and evenabove the Coref-GRU of Dhingra et al. (2018), interms of accuracy on (unmasked) validation set.The second important observation is that if wethen remove R-GCN (GloVe w/o R-GCN in Ta-ble 3), we lose 8.0 points. That is, the R-GCNcomponent pushes the model to perform aboveCoref-GRU still without accessing context, butrather by updating mention representations basedon their relation to other ones. These results high-light the impact of our R-GCN component.Graph edges ablationIn this experiment we in-vestigate the effect of the different relations avail-able in the entity graph and processed by the R-GCN module. We start off by testing our strongerencoder (i.e., ELMo) in absence of edges connect-ing mentions in the supporting documents (i.e., us-\f2312Modelunmaskedmaskedfull (ensemble)68.571.6full (single)65.1 ± 0.1170.4 ± 0.12GloVe with R-GCN59.211.1GloVe w/o R-GCN51.211.6No R-GCN62.463.2No relation types62.763.9No DOC-BASED62.965.8No MATCH64.367.4No COREF64.8–No COMPLEMENT64.170.3Induced edges61.556.4Table 3: Ablation study on WIKIHOP validation set.The full model is our Entity-GCN with all of its com-ponents and other rows indicate models trained withouta component of interest. We also report baselines usingGloVe instead of ELMo with and without R-GCN. Forthe full model we report mean ±1 std over 5 runs.ing only self-loops – No R-GCN in Table 3). Theresults suggest that WIKIPHOP genuinely requiresmultihop inference, as our best model is 6.1% and8.4% more accurate than this local model, in un-masked and masked settings, respectively.4 How-ever, it also shows that ELMo representations cap-ture predictive context features, without being ex-plicitly trained for the task. It conﬁrms that ourgoal of getting away with training expensive doc-ument encoders is a realistic one.We then inspect our model’s effectiveness inmaking use of the structure encoded in the graph.We start naively by fully-connecting all nodeswithin and across documents without distinguish-ing edges by type (No relation types in Table 3).We observe only marginal improvements with re-spect to ELMo alone (No R-GCN in Table 3) inboth the unmasked and masked setting suggest-ing that a GCN operating over a naive entity graphwould not add much to this task and a more infor-mative graph construction and/or a more sophisti-cated parameterization is indeed needed.Next, we ablate each type of relations inde-pendently, that is, we either remove connectionsof mentions that co-occur in the same docu-ment (DOC-BASED), connections between men-tions matching exactly (MATCH), or edges pre-dicted by the coreference system (COREF). The4Recall that all models in the ensemble use the same lo-cal representations, ELMo.ﬁrst thing to note is that the model makes betteruse of DOC-BASED connections than MATCH orCOREF connections. This is mostly because i) themajority of the connections are indeed betweenmentions in the same document, and ii) withoutconnecting mentions within the same documentwe remove important information since the modelis unaware they appear closely in the document.Secondly, we notice that coreference links andcomplement edges seem to play a more marginalrole. Though it may be surprising for coreferenceedges, recall that the MATCH heuristic already cap-tures the easiest coreference cases, and for the restthe out-of-domain coreference system may not bereliable. Still, modelling all these different rela-tions together gives our Entity-GCN a clear advan-tage. This is our best system evaluating on the de-velopment. Since Entity-GCN seems to gain littleadvantage using the coreference system, we reporttest results both with and without using it. Surpris-ingly, with coreference, we observe performancedegradation on the test set. It is likely that the testdocuments are harder for the coreference system.5We do perform one last ablation, namely, we re-place our heuristic for assigning edges and theirlabels by a model component that predicts them.The last row of Table 3 (Induced edges) showsmodel performance when edges are not predeter-mined but predicted. For this experiment, we use abilinear function fe(ˆxi, ˆxj) = σ\u0000ˆx⊤i Weˆxj\u0001thatpredicts the importance of a single edge connect-ing two nodes i, j using the query-dependent rep-resentation of mentions (see Section 2.3).Theperformance drops below ‘No R-GCN’ suggestingthat it cannot learn these dependencies on its own.Most results are stronger for the masked set-tings even though we do not apply the coreferenceresolution system in this setting due to masking.It is not surprising as coreferred mentions are la-beled with the same identiﬁer in the masked ver-sion, even if their original surface forms did notmatch (Welbl et al. (2018) used WIKIPEDIA linksfor masking). Indeed, in the masked version, anentity is always referred to via the same uniquesurface form (e.g., MASK1) within and across doc-uments.In the unmasked setting, on the otherhand, mentions to an entity may differ (e.g., “US”vs “United States”) and they might not be retrievedby the coreference system we are employing, mak-5Since the test set is hidden from us, we cannot analyzethis difference further.\f2313RelationAccuracyP@2P@5Avg. |Cq|Supportsoverall (ensemble)68.581.094.120.4 ± 16.65129overall (single model)65.379.792.920.4 ± 16.651293 bestmember of political party85.595.798.65.4 ± 2.470record label83.093.699.312.4 ± 6.1283publisher81.596.3100.09.6 ± 5.1543 worstplace of birth51.067.286.827.2 ± 14.5309place of death50.067.389.125.1 ± 14.3159inception29.953.283.121.9 ± 11.077Table 4: Accuracy and precision at K (P@K in the table) analysis overall and per query type.

First of all, welook at which type of questions our model per-forms well or poorly. There are more than 150query types in the validation set but we ﬁlteredthe three with the best and with the worst accu-racy that have at least 50 supporting documentsand at least 5 candidates. We show results in Ta-ble 4. We observe that questions regarding places(birth and death) are considered harder for Entity-GCN. We then inspect samples where our modelfails while assigning highest likelihood and no-ticed two principal sources of failure i) a mismatchbetween what is written in WIKIPEDIA and what isannotated in WIKIDATA, and ii) a different degreeof granularity (e.g., born in “London” vs “UK”could be considered both correct by a human butnot when measuring accuracy). See Table 6 in thesupplement material for some reported samples.Secondly, we study how the model performancedegrades when the input graph is large. In particu-lar, we observe a negative Pearson’s correlation (-0.687) between accuracy and the number of candi-date answers. However, the performance does notdecrease steeply. The distribution of the number ofcandidates in the dataset peaks at 5 and has an av-erage of approximately 20. Therefore, the model6Though other systems do not explicitly link matchingmentions, they similarly beneﬁt from masking (e.g., masksessentially single out spans that contain candidate answers).does not see many samples where there are a largenumber of candidate entities during training. Dif-ferently, we notice that as the number of nodes inthe graph increases, the model performance dropsbut more gently (negative but closer to zero Pear-son’s correlation). This is important as documentsets can be large in practical applications. See Fig-ure 3 in the supplemental material for plots.5Related WorkIn previous work, BiDAF (Seo et al., 2016),FastQA(Weissenbornetal.,2017),Coref-GRU (Dhingra et al., 2018), MHPGM (Baueret al., 2018), and Weaver / Jenga (Raison et al.,2018) have been applied to multi-document ques-tion answering. The ﬁrst two mainly focus on sin-gle document QA and Welbl et al. (2018) adaptedboth of them to work with WIKIHOP. They pro-cess each instance of the dataset by concatenat-ing all d ∈Sq in a random order adding doc-ument separator tokens. They trained using theﬁrst answer mention in the concatenated documentand evaluating exact match at test time. Coref-GRU, similarly to us, encodes relations betweenentity mentions in the document. Instead of us-ing graph neural network layers, as we do, theyaugment RNNs with jump links corresponding topairs of corefereed mentions.MHPGM uses amulti-attention mechanism in combination withexternal commonsense relations to perform mul-tiple hops of reasoning.Weaver is a deep co-encoding model that uses several alternating bi-LSTMs to process the concatenated documentsand the query.Graph neural networks have been shown suc-cessful on a number of NLP tasks (Marcheggianiand Titov, 2017; Bastings et al., 2017; Zhang et al.,\f23142018a), including those involving document levelmodeling (Peng et al., 2017). They have also beenapplied in the context of asking questions aboutknowledge contained in a knowledge base (Zhanget al., 2018b). In Schlichtkrull et al. (2018), GCNsare used to capture reasoning chains in a knowl-edge base. Our work and unpublished concurrentwork by Song et al. (2018) are the ﬁrst to studygraph neural networks in the context of multi-document QA. Besides differences in the architec-ture, Song et al. (2018) propose to train a combi-nation of a graph recurrent network and an RNNencoder. We do not train any RNN document en-coders in this work.6ConclusionWe designed a graph neural network that oper-ates over a compact graph representation of a setof documents where nodes are mentions to en-tities and edges signal relations such as withinand cross-document coreference.The modellearns to answer questions by gathering evidencefrom different documents via a differentiable mes-sage passing algorithm that updates node repre-sentations based on their neighbourhood.Ourmodel outperforms published results where abla-tions show substantial evidence in favour of multi-step reasoning. Moreover, we make the model fastby using pre-trained (contextual) embeddings.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Johannes Welbl for help-ing to test our system on WIKIHOP.Thisproject is supported by SAP Innovation CenterNetwork, ERC Starting Grant BroadSem (678254)and the Dutch Organization for Scientiﬁc Re-search (NWO) VIDI 639.022.518.

Here the computational steps1. ELMo embeddings are a concatenation ofthree 1024-dimensional vectors resulting in3072-dimensional input vectors {xi}Ni=1.2. For the query representation q, we apply 2bi-LSTM layers of 256 and 128 hidden unitsto its ELMo vectors. The concatenation ofthe forward and backward states results in a256-dimensional question representation.3. ELMo embeddings of candidates are pro-jected to 256-dimensional vectors, concate-nated to the q, and further transformed witha two layers MLP of 1024 and 512 hiddenunits in 512-dimensional query aware entityrepresentations {ˆxi}Ni=1 ∈R512.4. All transformations f∗in R-GCN-layers areafﬁne and they do maintain the input and out-put dimensionality of node representationsthe same (512-dimensional).5. Eventually, a 2-layers MLP with [256, 128]hidden units takes the concatenation between{h(L)i}Ni=1 and q to predict the probabilitythat a candidate node vi may be the answerto the query q (see Equation 1).During preliminary trials, we experimentedwith different numbers of R-GCN-layers (in therange 1-7). We observed that with WIKIHOP, forL ≥3 models reach essentially the same perfor-mance, but more layers increase the time requiredto train them. Besides, we observed that the gatingmechanism learns to keep more and more informa-tion from the past at each layer making unneces-sary to have more layers than required.A.2Training DetailsWe train our models with a batch size of 32for at most 20 epochs using the Adam opti-mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2015) with β1 = 0.9,β2 = 0.999 and a learning rate of 10−4. To helpagainst overﬁtting, we employ dropout (drop rate∈0, 0.1, 0.15, 0.2, 0.25) (Srivastava et al., 2014)and early-stopping on validation accuracy. We re-port the best results of each experiment based onaccuracy on validation set.BError AnalysisIn Table 6, we report three samples from WIKI-HOP development set where out Entity-GCN fails.In particular, we show two instances where ourmodel presents high conﬁdence on the answer,and one where is not. We commented these sam-ples explaining why our model might fail in thesecases.CAblation StudyIn Figure 3, we show how the model performancegoes when the input graph is large.

Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions Staff of the Global Legal Research Directorate   I.  Introduction  This report, prepared by the research staff of the Law Library of Congress, surveys 39 jurisdictions regarding whether, and if so how, they restrict ownership of land by foreigners.1 The jurisdictions surveyed were among those with the highest gross domestic product according to 2021 World Bank data, selected to ensure broadly representative coverage.2  We identified 10 countries that do not restrict land ownership by foreigners: Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, Japan, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Sweden, and the United Kingdom.   We found that the following countries do not permit foreign ownership of land, although exceptions may apply in some cases or other rights to land may be acquired: China, Indonesia, Nigeria, Philippines, and Thailand.   Among the other jurisdictions surveyed, some have restrictions that apply to different types of land, including agricultural, residential, and commercial land. Other types of restriction are based on the location of the land, such as near the border or military establishments. Some jurisdictions restrict particular categories of foreigners from land ownership. Some require special permission or approval for foreigners before they can acquire land.   Ownership of agricultural land by foreigners is restricted by some provinces of Canada, and by Egypt, India (restricted for diplomatic personnel, nonresidents of Indian origin and nonresident citizens without registration), Iran, Poland (permit required), and Russia. Argentina, Brazil, and Turkey restrict ownership of rural or local land to a percentage of the total land of the local jurisdiction.   Article XVII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) obligates members to provide national treatment to other members, i.e., “treatment no less favourable than that it accords to its own.”3 If land ownership restrictions result in less favorable treatment of foreigners, GATS  1 The surveyed jurisdictions are Argentina, Australia, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, China, Egypt, Finland, Germany, Greece, India, Indonesia, Iran, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Nigeria, Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Russia, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, United Arab Emirates, and the United Kingdom. 2 World Bank Databank, Gross Domestic Product 2021 (Jan. 15, 2023), https://perma.cc/GP7Y-Z8K8.  3 General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS), Apr. 15, 1994, Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization, Annex 1B, art.

Several other jurisdictions that also restrict ownership for national security purposes have entered restrictions on their GATS schedules. Such jurisdictions include Argentina and Mexico (border area), Iran (sensitive areas), South Korea (military bases and installation protection zones), Taiwan (lands within fortified and military areas and adjacent to the national frontiers), and Turkey (designated military zones).   There are other various restrictions on foreigners’ land ownership. Figure 1 below shows in simplified format the surveyed jurisdictions that impose particular categories of restrictions. On page 4, a color-coded map sets forth which jurisdictions permit foreign acquisition, prohibit it, or impose restrictions. A Comparative Summary Table beginning on page 5 presents the essential findings of our study for each jurisdiction. Lastly, the textual surveys for each jurisdiction provide further detail.     4 Id. art.

Jurisdictional Surveys   Argentina  The general rule is that natural and legal foreign nationals have the same rights as Argentine citizens to obtain property rights in the country, with exceptions established in Law No. 26.737 of 2011.8 This law prohibits foreign ownership of property that contains or borders large and permanent bodies of water and land located in border security zones.9   Before acquiring rural land, a foreign person must ask the National Rural Land Registry to issue the corresponding enabling certificate.10 The agency will issue that certificate depending on the following restrictions:  • The total percentage of foreign ownership of rural lands in the national, provincial, or departmental territory must not exceed 15%.11 • Foreigners of the same nationality must not exceed 30% of the total limit on foreigners owning or possessing land.12 • A foreign owner may not possess more than a certain number of hectares that varies according to where the rural lands are located, under a system of equivalences defined by the authorities.13  The following individuals—not legal persons—of foreign nationality are exempt from these restrictions:  • Those who have 10 years of continuous, permanent, and proven residence in the country.14 • Those who have Argentine children and demonstrate a permanent, continuous, and proven residence in the country for five years.15 • Those married to an Argentine citizen within five years before the constitution or transmission of the pertinent rights who demonstrate continuous, permanent, and proven  8 Ley No. 26.737, Régimen de Protección al Dominio Nacional sobre la Propiedad, Posesión o Tenencia de las Tierras Rurales, Dec. 28, 2011, https://perma.cc/AAX2-P5P5.  9 Id. art. 10. 10 Id. art. 14. 11 Id. art. 8. 12 Id. art. 9. 13 Id. art. 10. 14 Id. art. 4. 15 Id. \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 13 residence in Argentina for the same term.16 Individuals in civil unions and individuals in marriages are treated equally under the exemption.17  Australia  The acquisition of land in Australia by foreign persons,18 including residential, commercial, and agricultural land, is subject to the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) (FATA)19 and the Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulation 2015 (Cth) (Regulations). 20  The Australian Parliamentary Library, in a guide on foreign acquisition of residential land, explains that FATA regulates the following actions:  • a significant action being an action taken by a foreign person to acquire interests in securities, assets or Australian land (which includes residential land) provided that the threshold test is met [section 43]. Importantly, the threshold value for residential land has been set at $0. An action is a significant action if it results in a change in control involving a foreign person [section 39] • a notifiable action being an action to acquire an interest in Australian land provided that the threshold test is met. Unlike significant actions, notifiable actions do not require a change in control [section 47] and • a notifiable national security action being an action that is taken, or proposed to be taken, by a foreign person such as acquiring an interest in Australian land that, at the time of acquisition, is national security land (defined in section 5 of the Regulations) [section 55B].21  Under the legislation, foreign persons generally require investment approval from the Treasurer  • “before acquiring an interest in residential land, regardless of its value” • “before acquiring an interest in agricultural land, where the cumulative value of their agricultural land holdings exceeds (or would exceed with the proposed investment) [AU]$15 million [about US$10 million]” • “before acquiring an interest in commercial land, where the value of that investment is above a certain monetary threshold”  16 Id. 17 Decreto 274/2012, Reglamentación de la Ley No. 26.737 que estableció el Régimen de Protección al Dominio Nacional sobre la Propiedad, Posesión o Tenencia de las Tierras Rurales, Feb. 29, 2012, art. 4, https://perma.cc/QF7E-HNWY.  18 For information on what constitutes a “foreign person,” see Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), Key Concepts 3–7 (Guidance 2, last updated July 29, 2022), https://perma.cc/Y54L-4LCU. 19 Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Act 1975 (Cth) (FATA), https://perma.cc/435A-APBL.  20 Foreign Acquisitions and Takeovers Regulation 2015 (Cth) (Regulations), https://perma.cc/93LU-F3LL.  21 Paula Pyburne, Foreign Acquisition of Residential Land: A Quick Guide, Australian Parliamentary Library (Feb. 24, 2023), https://perma.cc/39S3-TSB4.

Foreign persons must also separately notify the Government once they have acquired an interest in agricultural land that was the subject of a foreign investment approval.”27 • “Foreign persons must also register certain interests they acquire in water entitlements and water rights on the Register of Foreign Ownership of Water Entitlements.”28   In March 2023, the Australian Taxation Office, which administers the above-referenced foreign investment registers, announced that a new Register of Foreign Ownership of Australian Assets will commence in mid-2023 and will “replace existing foreign investment registers we manage (relating to agricultural and residential land, and water interests),” as well as “expand on assets to be registered.”29 This follows amendments made to FATA by the Foreign Investment Reform (Protecting Australia’s National Security) Act 2020 (Cth).30   22 Land Investments, FIRB, https://perma.cc/GX6M-9KHZ.

No restrictions apply to citizens from European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries.34 In addition, Austria has concluded bilateral agreements that exempt certain third-country citizens from the prior authorization requirement.35  The Austrian Federal Constitutional Act (Bundes-Verfassungsgesetz, B-VG) provides that the Austrian federal states are competent to legislate in all matters not expressly assigned to the Federation.36 Regulations for real property transactions of foreigners are explicitly exempt from the competency of the Federation, meaning the nine states have enacted different acts for the acquisition of real property by foreigners and requirements may vary.37 Some states have enacted specific acts for the acquisition of real property by foreign nationals, such as Vienna,38 whereas others have integrated provisions on foreign nationals into the general real property acquisition act, such as Tyrol.39 Some provinces, such as Styria, do not require an authorization for foreign nationals depending on the location of the property, for example no authorization is required in Graz, the capital of Styria.40   In general, an authorization for the acquisition of real property by foreign nationals is granted if there is a “cultural, social or economic interest in concluding the legal transaction” and provided  31 See Allens Linklaters, Overview of Australia’s Foreign Investment Approval (FIRB) Regime (Jan. 1, 2023), https://perma.cc/5BCE-46WT.  32 Guidance Notes, FIRB, https://perma.cc/T5WV-63UC.  33 FATA s 83, referring to part 5 of the act. 34 The EEA consists of the EU Member States and the three European Free Trade Association (EFTA) states Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway.

Brazil  In Brazil, Law No. 5,709 of October 7, 2021, regulates the acquisition of rural property by an alien resident in the country or by a pessoa jurídica estrangeira (foreign company) authorized to operate there.42 Decree No. 74,965 of November 26, 1974, regulates Law No. 5,709,43 and states further that Brazilian companies in which foreign persons or companies hold the majority of its share capital and reside or have their headquarters abroad are also subject to the regime established by Decree No. 74,965.44  The acquisition of rural property by an alien individual may not exceed 50 modules for indefinite exploration (Módulo de Exploração Indefinida, MEI), in a continuous or discontinuous area.45 In the case of a property with an area not exceeding three modules, the acquisition will be free, regardless of any authorization or license, subject to the general requirements determined by law.46 Article 3 § 2 states that the executive branch will issue rules for the acquisition of an area between three and 50 MEI.47   Law No. 8,629 of February 25, 1993, provides for the regulation of constitutional provisions related to agrarian reform, as set forth in Chapter III, Title VII, of the Federal Constitution of 1988.48 According to article 23, foreigners residing in the country and legal entities authorized to operate in Brazil may only lease rural property pursuant to Law No. 5709, of October 7, 1971.49 All limits, restrictions, and conditions applicable to the acquisition of rural properties by aliens  41 Authorisation Procedure for Nationals of Third Countries, supra note 35.  42 Lei No. 5.709, de 7 de Outubro de 1971, art. 1, https://perma.cc/VEL6-VM52.  43 Decreto No. 74.965, de 26 de Novembro de 1974, art. 1, https://perma.cc/Y4TH-SBRT.  44 Id. art. 1 § 1. 45 Lei No. 5.709, de 7 de Outubro de 1971, art. 3.

However, some exceptions in Chilean law restrict foreigners’ acquisition of real estate.  Decree Law No. 1.939,60 which lays down rules on the acquisition, administration, and disposal of public property, establishes the following main limitations:  • Public lands located up to 10 kilometers from the border may only be owned or leased by Chilean natural or legal persons.61 • Public lands located up to 5 kilometers from the coast may only be owned or leased by Chilean natural or legal persons, except that foreigners domiciled in Chile may do so subject to a favorable report from the Undersecretariat of the Navy.62 • Nationals of bordering countries, that is, Argentines, Bolivians, and Peruvians, may not acquire the domain and other property rights or possess tenancy of real estate located totally or partially in areas of the currently declared border, unless a presidential decree expressly exempts nationals of neighboring countries.63  • The prohibition described above also extends to companies or legal persons with their principal place of business in a neighboring country (Argentina, Bolivia, or Peru), or whose capital is 40% or more owned or whose effective control is in the hands of nationals of those countries.64 The president of the republic may expressly exempt nationals of neighboring countries from this prohibition.65 China  Individuals cannot privately own land in the People’s Republic of China (PRC or China). According to the PRC Constitution, land in urban areas is owned by the state, whereas land in rural and suburban areas is owned by rural collectives, except where ownership belongs to the state according to law.66 The Land Management Law proclaims that the land of the PRC is subject  60 Decreto Ley No. 1.939, que fija normas sobre adquisición, administración y disposición de bienes del Estado, Noviembre 10, 1977, https://perma.cc/5PLT-CTN7.  61 Id. art. 6. 62 Id. art. 6. 63 Id. art. 7. 64 Id. art. 7. 65 Id. art. 7. 66 PRC Constitution (adopted by the National People’s Congress (NPC) on Dec. 4, 1982, as amended Mar. 11, 2018) art. 10, https://perma.cc/QF3J-FVU8 (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/VEW7-PMVK (English translation).  \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 20 to socialist public ownership, “namely, ownership by the whole people or collective ownership of the working masses.”67  In urban areas, the state grants (churang in Chinese, also translated as “assigns”) land use rights to land users for a certain number of years, where land users pay the state granting fees.68 Land use rights may also be allocated (huabo in Chinese), which is limited to such purposes as government or military use, urban infrastructure, or public utilities. For allocated land-use rights, land users pay no fee or only compensation or resettlement expenses.69 Foreign individuals and enterprises may obtain urban land use rights and engage in land development, unless otherwise provided by law, according to the Urban Land Assignment Regulations.70  Individuals can privately own residential houses and apartments, although not the land on which the buildings and structures are situated.71 Foreign individuals who work or study in China as well as the branches and representative offices established by foreign entities in China may purchase residential houses or offices in China for their own use, according to a circular jointly issued by several central government authorities in 2015.72 In those cities that implement policies restricting house purchases, such policies also apply to foreign individuals.73   Foreign individuals may also incorporate foreign-invested enterprises in accordance with the Foreign Investment Law to invest in real estate in China. 74 Anyone engaging in real estate development or other related activities in China, domestic or foreign, must obtain a qualification certification for real estate development enterprises from the government.75  In rural areas, China has implemented a “contractual management system” regarding agricultural land.76 Agricultural land includes cultivated land, forestland, grassland, and other  67 Land Management Law (adopted by the NPC Standing Committee (NPCSC) on June 25, 1986, as amended Aug. 26, 2019) art. 2, https://perma.cc/CDC5-HNPF (in Chinese).  68 Law on the Administration of Urban Real Estate (adopted by the NPCSC on July 5, 1994, as amended Aug. 26, 2019) art. 8, https://perma.cc/W47T-LMWY (in Chinese). 69 Id. art. 23.  70 Urban Land Assignment Regulations (promulgated by the State Council on May 19, 1990, as revised Nov. 29, 2020) art. 3, https://perma.cc/7MGZ-B64H (in Chinese).  71 Civil Code (adopted by the NPC on May 28, 2020, effective Jan. 1, 2021) art. 266, https://perma.cc/5XQ3-NVWF (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/JC6H-NZUW (English translation). 72 Ministry of Hous. & Urban-Rural Dev., Ministry of Com.

The country is building a system of “circulating the land management right” regarding agricultural land. The system would allow the holder of the contractual management right, while still retaining that right, to transfer (“circulate”) the “land management right” to others by means permitted by law, such as a lease (subcontract).81 In January 2021, China’s Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Affairs (MARA) issued the Administrative Measures for the Circulation of Rural Land Management Right. The measures require the transferees of land management rights to be “organizations and individuals with agricultural management capabilities or qualifications,” and “under the same conditions, members of the collective economic organization enjoy priority.”82 While MARA’s measures do not specifically exclude foreign-invested enterprises or overseas investors as transferees, they would be subject to conditions provided by other laws and regulations.83  Egypt   Law No. 230 of 1996 regulates the ownership of a foreign national to real properties and lands in Egypt for residential purposes. The Law sets a number of conditions governing the ownership of land or a residential property by a foreign national.84 Those conditions include the following:  • A foreign national must not own more than two pieces of land or two real estate properties for residential purposes.85   77 Law on Land Contracting in Rural Areas (adopted by the NPCSC on Aug. 29, 2002, as amended Dec. 29, 2018) art. 2, https://perma.cc/4CVN-MP8R (in Chinese).  78 Id. arts. 3, 13. 79 Id. art. 4.  80 Id. art. 16. 81 Id. art. 36. 82 MARA, Administrative Measures for the Circulation of Rural Land Management Right (Jan. 26, 2021) art. 9, https://perma.cc/U22G-U3LS (in Chinese). 83 Gen.

Ownership of desert lands by foreigners must be a joint ownership with an Egyptian party. The Law limits the right to ownership of desert lands by foreign entities and foreign nationals to 49% and 51% by the Egyptian party.93   Law No. 15 of 1963 prohibits the ownership of agriculture lands by foreign nationals.94 Moreover, Prime Minister Resolution No. 215 of 2017, on the ownership of land by foreigners in the Sinai Peninsula, prohibits the ownership of any properties and lands in Sinai by foreign nationals.

Pursuant to Law No. 72 of 2017, a foreign investor has the right to own, manage, use, and dispose of the investment projects located in the aforementioned zones.97   Finland    Finland does not restrict the purchase or sale of property to or from foreign legal persons or entities in general.98 However, the Act on Monitoring of Foreigner’s Corporate Acquisitions specifies that a foreigner’s purchase of certain businesses with vital interests for Finland must receive prior approval from the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Employment before the purchase is completed.99 This could include land. Businesses with vital interests for Finland include defense industry corporations, businesses that produce or supply critical products or services to Finnish government agencies, or a business or organization that is critical to securing vital functions of society.100 The Ministry must approve any sale in which a vital interest is at stake; further, it cannot deny applications where vital interests are not at risk.101   However, the autonomous region of Åland (the Åland Islands), which is part of Finland but enjoys autonomy, restricts land ownership to Ålandic citizens (persons with Åländsk hembygdsrätt).102 In order to own land on Åland, a person must prove that he or she is a Finnish citizen, has lived on Åland for a minimum of five years, and speaks Swedish.103 A person without hembygdsrätt, including foreigners, can only acquire real property with the prior approval from the Government of Åland (Ålands landskapsregering).104  Finland has made no reservation on land ownership under GATS XVII.105  96 Law No. 72 of 2017, art. 1, Al-Jaridah Al-Rasmiyah, vol. 21 (duplicate), 31 May 2017, https://perma.cc/MUN2-YFGQ (in Arabic).  97 Id. arts. 6, 57.  98 Maakaari (Land Code) (1995/540), https://perma.cc/2G68-LUAX (in Finnish), Jordabalk (FFS 1995/540), https://perma.cc/5ZSW-DFR2 (in Swedish). 99 3-5 §§ Laki ulkomaalaisten yritysostojen seurannasta [Act on Monitoring of Foreigner’s Corporate Acquisitions] (2012/172), https://perma.cc/L5QP-3JHA (in Finnish), Lag om tillsyn över utlänningars företagsköp (FFS 2012/172), https://perma.cc/97AG-LN6C (in Swedish).  100 Id. § 2(2). 101 Id. §§ 4(2), 5(2). 102 2 § Jordförvärvslag för Åland (Ålandic Land Acquisition Act) (ÅLS 1975:7) (1991/72), https://perma.cc/2GU9-CPHB (in Swedish). 103 7 § Självstyrelselag(ÅLS 1991:71), https://perma.cc/Z7Y7-FNG3; Landskapslag om åländsk hembygdsrätt (ÅLS 2015:99), https://perma.cc/RXU5-KSUJ.  104 2 § Ålandic Land Acquisition Act.  105 General Agreement on Trade in Services GATS/EL/33 (April 15, 1994) (94-1116), Finland,  https://perma.cc/57T3-27ZH.  \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 24  France    A search of relevant French law did not reveal any regulation limiting foreigners’ rights to own land.  Germany    Currently, Germany does not impose any restrictions on foreigners buying property in Germany. The Introductory Act to the Civil Code (Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche, EBGBG) provides that starting July 30, 1998, provisions that restrict the acquisition of property rights by foreigners or foreign legal persons or that make them dependent on obtaining prior authorization will no longer apply.106 However, the federal government, with the consent of the German Bundesrat, is authorized to enact ordinances imposing such restrictions on or requiring prior authorization from foreigners if the country in question imposes restrictions on Germans or German legal persons with regard to acquiring rights and foreign policy reasons, in particular the right to retorsion, require it.107 Such restrictions cannot be imposed on foreigners and foreign legal persons from the European Union.108 No such ordinance has been enacted.  Articles 86 and 88 of the Introductory Act to the Civil Code used to provide that various state level laws that were enacted before the German Basic Law, the country’s constitution, entered into force in 1949 and imposed restrictions on foreigners buying property would remain in force.109 As a reason for amending the law, the German Bundestag (parliament) stated in 1998 that such restrictions “impede the relocation of foreign embassies [from Bonn] to Berlin and complicate negotiations with other countries to remove barriers for German companies to acquire property abroad.”110  Greece  There appears to be no general prohibition on foreign persons’ acquisition of real property in Greece. The only legal restriction on acquisition of real property based on the owner’s nationality is provided in Law 1892/1990.111 This law designates certain localities and islands as “border areas” and prohibits the acquisition of real estate in these areas by non-Greek natural and legal  106 Einführungsgesetz zum Bürgerlichen Gesetzbuche [EGBGB], Sept. 21, 1994, Bundesgesetzblatt [BGBl.] I at 2494; 1997 BGBl.

Below are some restrictions placed on foreigners and non-resident Indians.  Section 4 of the 2018 Regulations stipulates that “No person being a citizen of Pakistan, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka, Afghanistan, China, Iran, Nepal or Bhutan shall acquire or transfer immovable property in India, other than lease, not exceeding five years without prior permission of Reserve Bank.”119 However, certain minorities from these countries who have a long term visa appear to make an exception, as follows:  112 Law 1892/1990 lists the prohibited localities and islands as “the Prefectures of Dodecanese, Evros, Thesprotia, Kastoria, Kilkis, Lesvos, Xanthi, Preveza, Rhodope, Samos, Florina, Chios, Thera and Skyros, the former provinces of Nefrokopio in the former Prefecture of Drama, Pogoni and Konitsa in the former Prefecture of Ioannina, Almopia and Edessa in the former Prefecture of Pella and Sintiki in the former Prefecture of Serres, as well as the former municipalities of Othona, Mathraki and Erekoussi.” Law 1892/1990, art. 24(1).

Foreign Nationals of non Indian origin who have acquired immovable property in India by way of inheritance with the specific approval of RBI can not transfer such property without prior permission of RBI.121  This rule appears to be derived by Section 6(5) of the Act, which allows a person residing outside of India to hold immovable property in India if it was acquired when the person was resident in India  (5) A person resident outside India may hold, own, transfer or invest in Indian currency, security or any immovable property situated in India if such currency, security or property was acquired, held or owned by such person when he was resident in India or inherited from a person who was resident in India.122  Diplomatic personal associated with a foreign embassy or consulate in India are allowed to purchase and sell immovable property in India other than agricultural land, plantation property, and farm house, provided that  120 Id. § 7. 121 Ministry of External Affairs, Acquisition And Transfer Of Immovable Property In India, at 3, https://perma.cc/A3J8-VH74.  122 Foreign Exchange Management Act (FEMA), § 6(5). \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 27  (i) clearance from Government of India, Ministry of External Affairs is obtained for such purchase/sale, and  (ii) the consideration for acquisition of immovable property in India is paid out of funds remitted from abroad through banking channel.123  According to the Ministry of External Affairs, a person resident outside India who is a person of Indian Origin (PIO) can acquire any immovable property in India other than agricultural land, farm house, and plantation property  i.

A PIO may transfer agricultural land / Plantation property / farm house in India by way of sale or gift to person resident in India who is a citizen of India.124  An Indian citizen residing outside India is designated as a Non-resident Indian (NRI). Overseas Citizen of India (OCI), on the other hand, refers to an Indian citizen residing outside India who is registered as an Overseas Citizen of India Cardholder under India’s Citizenship law. The OCI cardholder has certain rights and benefits including lifelong visa to visit India, “exemption from reporting to Police authorities for any length of stay in India” and certain financial, economic and educational benefits.125 Section 3 of the 2018 Regulations apply to NRIs and OCIs.126 According to the Ministry of External Affairs  [a] person resident outside India who is a citizen of India (NRI) can acquire by way of purchase, any immovable property in India other than agricultural land/plantation property/farm house.

However, foreigners will only be able to own apartments located in special economic zones, free trade zones, industrial estates, and other economic zones. Further, the property must be worth more than the minimum threshold – which differs depending on the province where the property is located.140  The briefing further explains that  [t]here are two types of right to use (HP) titles:  • Right to use within a certain period; and • Right to use for land used for specific purposes.  This land title usually refers to the right to use/harvest land directly owned by the state or private land. This land could also be used for a building site in addition to agricultural purposes.  The right to use the title for a certain period can be granted to foreign legal entities that have a representative office, foreign citizens, as well as local entities and citizens. This encompasses state land, freehold title land, and the right to manage land.  If granted for state land and the right to manage land, the title is for a maximum term of 30 years and extendable for another 20. Once the time period expires, the title can be extended for another 30 years (total 80 years). Previously, an HP title could only be granted for 25 years, and extended for another 20 years, before another renewal of 25 years (total 70 years).  The right to build (HGB) is a title that is granted over state or freehold land to Indonesian citizens and foreign companies (PT PMA) for the purpose of erecting or using a building on the land. The maximum term for an HGB title is 30 years and is extendable for another 20 years. Once this expires, it can be renewed again for another 30 years (80 years in total).  The right to cultivate (HGU) is normally granted to state land for the development of plantations and can be granted to foreign companies. The maximum term for this land title is 35 years and is extendable for another 25 years. Upon expiry, this can then be extended by another 35 years.  GR 18/2021 requires that HGU, HGB, and HP title holders must commence activities on the land, whether building construction, cultivation, or other use of land, within two years of the title being granted.141  “PT PMA” refers to foreign investment companies (Penanaman Modal Asing). Such companies are domiciled and established under the laws of Indonesia and have one or more foreign  140 Situmorang & Putri, supra note 5. 141 Id. \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 30 shareholders.142 Therefore, although a foreign individual cannot own land, “any foreign investor can “purchase” land leases through their PMA company thereafter such PMA company will be the party in the sale-and-purchase agreement.”143 As noted above, under the 2021 regulation, an HM holder can grant HGB over the land to such companies for up to a total of 80 years.144   A Baker McKenzie real estate guide provides additional information on the ability for foreign residents to obtain HP with respect to residential property:  [u]nder the new HP related regulations, if a house or apartment currently under HM or HGB title is purchased by a resident foreigner, then the conversion of the title to become HP will automatically happen, and if the house or apartment is then transferred to an Indonesian, the title can be re-converted to a HM and HGB title.  If a resident foreigner buys a residential property (built on land with HGB title), the title of the residential property will be deemed to be converted into HP upon the signing of the sale and purchase document before a PPAT [land deed official, Pejabat Pembuat Akta Tanah]. The PPAT will then register the transaction at the relevant Land Office so that the Land Office can manually update the title certificate to reflect the change of the residential property from HGB to HP.  For strata title apartments or HMSRS, the title of the underlying land will remain HGB title. So upon a purchase by a resident foreigner, only that particular unit will be converted into a HP strata title (Hak Pakai Atas Satuan Rumah Susun). Only if all apartment units are owned by resident foreigners can the underlying land be converted to HP title.  The government stipulates minimum prices for houses or apartments that can be purchased by resident foreigners depending on the location of the house or apartment. For example, in Jakarta the price of a house must be IDR 10 billion or more while for an apartment it must be IDR 3 billion or more. For the Banten and Bali provinces, the price of a house must be IDR 5 billion or more while for an apartment IDR 2 billion or more.  Resident foreigners (except for foreign country representatives or international agency representatives) can only have one plot of land per person/family and the maximum land area is 2,000 square meters (which can be increased subject to approval from the Minister of Agrarian Affairs and Spatial Planning/Head of Land Office).145  Iran  Iranian laws provide for restriction of foreigners’ ownership rights, usually depending on reciprocity and bilateral agreements with foreign countries. Ownership of agricultural lands, investment properties, and land in sensitive areas, including free trade-industrial zones, is prohibited.146 However, foreign-owned companies registered in Iran as resident legal entities are  142 Situmorang & Putri, supra note 5. 143 Id. 144 GR 18/2021 art. 52(3). 145 Widyatmoko, supra note 12.

It appears that there is no differentiation between the ownership rights of foreign nationals generally and those of citizens of particular countries. As a general principle, the Iranian Constitution prohibits any agreements that could result in domination and control of the country’s economic, cultural, natural, military, and other resources by foreign nationals or governments.147 Stricter measures are imposed against Iranian nationals who obtain dual citizenship without the Iranian government’s permission. They lose all their rights to real estate properties in Iran. These properties will be sold under the supervision of the local public prosecutor, and the proceeds will be paid to the dual citizens after deduction of the expenses of the sale.148   The Civil Code does not directly establish foreign nationals’ ownership rights pertaining to immovable properties; however, it implies that such rights are possible with some limitations, which should be explicitly provided by national laws. According to the Foreign Nationals Ownership Regulations of 1949, foreign nationals legally resident in Iran can petition the General Bureau for Registration of Deeds and Landed Properties for permission to purchase real estate for residential or business purposes. Foreign legal persons that are registered in Iran can submit similar applications for purchasing real estate. 149 Foreign citizens who change their resident status in Iran and move out of the country should transfer their real estate rights to an Iranian citizen within six months of moving. Otherwise, the government will hold a real estate auction and provide the remittances to the foreign national owners or their heirs. The sale option is not required if the foreign national is from a country that liberally allows property ownership rights to Iranian nationals.150  Inherited property can be transferred to non-Iranian heirs of foreign nationals, if the application is filed within two years of the passing of the original foreign national owner. Otherwise, the property will be auctioned, and the remittances will be given to the heirs after deduction of the costs.151  Nonresident foreigners (visitors) who have regularly and continually traveled to Iran for recreational purposes throughout the years can apply for permission to purchase real estate suitable for their living needs in Iran without obtaining a resident permit. The property cannot be an investment property, and its purchase is subject to approval from the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, and Intelligence and the Council of Ministers.152    Farsi); Law on the Administration of Free Trade-Industrial Zones of the Islamic Republic of Iran 1993 (1372 Solar Year) art. 24, amend. 1, https://perma.cc/9BFL-J6PH (in Farsi). 147 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran 1979, as amended, arts. 43 (pt. 8), 153, https://perma.cc/WMB8-B542 (unofficial English translation). 148 Id. art 989.  149 Foreign Nationals Ownership Regulations 1949 (1328 Solar Year) art. 2. 150 Id. art. 1 (§ H, amend. 2).  151 Regulations for Ownership of Immovable Properties by Nonresident Foreign Nationals in the Islamic Republic of Iran 1995 (1374 Solar Year) arts. 5, 6, https://perma.cc/357N-DEAV (in Farsi). 152 Foreign Nationals Ownership Act 1963 (1342 Solar Year) art. 1, https://perma.cc/4N83-CHEM (in Farsi). \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 32 The Law on Foreign Nationals Immovable Properties of 1931 (1310 Solar Year) forbade ownership of any agricultural immovable properties by foreign nationals, which include agricultural irrigation canals and spring waters.

According to the Law on Protection of Schemes for Improvement/Renovation of the Muslim Holy Sites of 2006, the government can approve the sale of up to 4% of real estate properties in these areas, and only to Muslim foreign nationals for residential developmental projects.153  Ireland   There appear to be no prohibitions on the foreign ownership of property across the Republic of Ireland and a search of GATTS XVII reveals no reservations on land ownership in the country.154 There is a distinction in the payment of taxes between nonresident and resident landlords.  Tenants of nonresident owners are required to hold 20% of the annual rent and pay this withholding tax directly to Revenue, 155 unless a resident person acts as a collection agent. Collection agents may deduct the withholding tax from the rent paid and remit this, and other information, to Revenue.156  Israel  The Basic Law: Israel Lands prohibits the transfer of “Israel’s lands” by sale or by any other way, except with regard to “categories of real estate and categories of transactions prescribed on this matter by law.”157 “Israel’s lands” consist of “the real estate belonging to the State, [to] the Development Authority, or [to] the Jewish National Fund.”158  The Israel Lands Authority manages Israeli lands based on policies issued by the Israel Lands Council (ILC), which is appointed by the government.159 The grant or transfer of rights in Israeli lands to a foreigner requires approval by the ILC in accordance with procedures issued by the  153 Foreign Nationals Immovable Properties Law 1931 (1310 Solar Year), https://perma.cc/QY8J-94S5 (in Farsi); Law on Protection of Schemes for Improvement/Renovation of the [Named] Muslim Holy Sites 2006 (1384 Solar Year) single art., art. 1, https://perma.cc/G6SH-24PX (in Farsi). 154 Schedules of Specific Commitments and Lists of Article II Exemptions, World Trade Organization, https://perma.cc/MM44-TAQQ.  155 Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, No. 39, §§ 238 & 1041, https://perma.cc/MH2G-3FS9.  156 Id.

Approval may similarly be granted to a foreigner that has received “a grant under the Encouragement of Capital Investments Law, for the purpose of implementing the program for which the grant was approved . . . .”166  Until 2009, “almost all of Israel's residents lived in homes built on land owned by the State of Israel, which was leased to them for many years.” 167 Amendment No. 7 to the Israel Land Administration Law was adopted on August 10, 2009.

The notice prevents the transfer of private ownership to foreigners without the approval of the ILC.170  Italy    Concerning the acquisition of land by non-Italian citizens, Italian law distinguishes between foreigners in general, EU and EEA citizens, as well as stateless persons and refugees under certain conditions.  The prologue of the Civil Code contains a general principle (so-called preleggi; that is, applicable to all legislation) concerning the treatment of foreigners in Italy, in the following terms:   [t]he foreigner is allowed to enjoy the civil rights attributed to the [Italian] citizen on condition of reciprocity and without prejudice to the provisions contained in special laws.  This provision also applies to foreign legal entities.171   Only foreigners holding certain residence permits may acquire land in Italy on the same terms provided to Italian citizens, even in the absence of the reciprocity condition. According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,172 the following persons are deemed as legally equal to Italian citizens and, therefore, are exempt from the condition of reciprocity for the acquisition of land in Italy173:   168 Israel Land Administration (Amendment No. 7) Law, 5769-2009, Nevo, https://perma.cc/7A62-SJ96 (in Hebrew, by subscription).  169 Ori Chudy & Shay Pauzner, supra note 11. 170 Israel Law Administration Law, 5720-1960, § 4S, as amended under Amendment No. 7 Law, Nevo, https://perma.cc/EE7K-RLK2 (in Hebrew, by subscription). 171 Regio Decreto 16 marzo 1942, n. 262 Approvazione del Testo del Codice Civile, art. 16, https://perma.cc/S7DM-2C47. 172 Diritti e Reciprocità, Lo Straniero e la Condizione di Reciprocità, Ministero degli Affari Esteri e della Cooperazione Internazionale, https://perma.cc/4UU7-ATPN. 173 Decreto Legislativo 25 luglio 1998, n. 286, Testo unico delle Disposizioni concernenti la Disciplina dell’Immigrazione e Norme sulla Condizione dello Straniero (D.L.

However, this only applies in the situations contemplated in Presidential Decree No. 394 of 1999 and in international agreements that include the reciprocity condition.177  Foreigners lawfully residing in Italy but who do not hold one of the residence permits indicated above are unable to acquire real estate in Italy, unless the reciprocity condition between Italy and the foreigner’s country is fulfilled; that is, if the law of the foreigner’s country of origin allows Italian citizens, on equal terms, to purchase real estate in the foreigner’s national territory.  Japan   There appear to be no prohibitions on the foreign ownership of property in Japan. Though there is the Act on Foreign Nationals’ Rights in Relation to Land, which states that the government can prohibit the acquisition of land-related rights by foreigners or foreign corporations by a cabinet order,178 no such order has been enacted yet. In 2021, a law to restrict certain uses of lands around facilities and remote islands that are important for national security was enacted.179 The Diet and  174 The European Economic Area (EEA) is composed by the EU Member States and three of the EFTA States (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway).

However, a civil law notary must perform and register the transfer of the property in question.184 The deed is generally executed in the Dutch language.185 If one of the parties does not have sufficient command of Dutch, the law requires an interpreter to be present during the signing to translate.

Since May 1, 2016, due to Poland’s joining the EU, the permit requirement has been lifted for legal entities registered in the countries of the European Economic Area and Switzerland and citizens of these states. However, the exemption does not cover acquisition of real estate located in the border areas or agricultural land if the area of purchased land exceeds one hectare (approximately 2.47 acres.)209 Such land acquisitions require prior government authorization. The Ministry of Interior and Administration issues its approval of the land transaction in the form of an administrative decision, if there is no objection by the minister of National Defense regarding the sale of land in the border zone and by the minister of Rural Development in the case of agricultural real estate.210  European Economic Area and Swiss citizens are exempt from the requirement to obtain a permit for land acquisition if, prior to the purchase, they were leasing this land, legally resided in Poland,  203 Id. art.

In such cases, the price can be established by government authorities without considering the market value of the property in question.223   Concerning agricultural land, foreign nationals, foreign companies, and Russian companies with foreign capital exceeding 50% of charter capital can possess agricultural land plots under leasehold conditions only. The length of the lease cannot be longer than 49 years.224 However, the prohibition on possession of agricultural land does not apply to garden plots and other small land areas used for personal needs.225  Private possession of forests is not allowed in Russia; however, non-Russian individuals and companies are not included in the list of those who might be involved in legal relations regarding forests.226  In February 2022, restrictive measures against citizens and companies from so-called “unfriendly nations” were introduced by the Russian Government as an attempt to counter sanctions imposed  219 Federal Law No. 101 of July 24, 2002, on Circulation of Lands of Agricultural Designation arts. 2, 3, https://perma.cc/N83C-3MHT (in Russian). 220 Land Code art. 15. 221 Id.  222 Government Regulation No. 508 of July 5, 2001, on Approval of the List of Closed Administrative Territorial Units, Garant.ru, https://perma.cc/DT4A-ZH4T (in Russian).  223 Land Code art. 39_4(4).  224 Federal Law on Circulation of Lands of Agricultural Designation art. 9.  225 Stanislav Lipsky, Agricultural Land Owned by Foreign Citizens, in 2 Legal Issues of Real Estate: Trends in Changing Legislative Approaches to Land Regulations (2019), ConsultantPlus.ru, https://perma.cc/R4PT-6L3U (in Russian).  226 Forestry Code of the Russian Federation art. 4, adopted Dec. 4, 2006, by Federal Law No. 200-FZ, https://perma.cc/M9FN-7FGT (in Russian).  \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 42 on Russia after it attacked Ukraine.227 The list of unfriendly states includes Australia, Canada, Japan, the United Kingdom, the United States, the states of the European Union, and a number of other countries.228 A decree by Russia’s president established a new procedure for real estate transactions with the participation of individuals and companies from these countries. Under the new rules, all transactions related to land and immovable property, including purchase, gifting, exchange, testing, etc., as well as purchase of any type of securities in Russia, require approval from the Government Commission for Foreign Investments Supervision upon submission of a special application. The decree grants the commission the authority to impose special conditions and requirements for such transactions.229   Saudi Arabia   The Law on Real Estate Ownership and Investment by Non-Saudis is one of the main legal instruments regulating the right of foreign nationals to own land and real estate property in Saudi Arabia.230   The Law allows a non-Saudi investor (whether an entity or a person) to own real estate property or a piece of land necessary to establish an investment activity or for residential purposes. The purchased land or property for investment purposes must not be less than 30 million Saudi Riyals (approx. US$7.9 million). The foreign national must complete all constructions and developments of the investment property within five years from the purchase date.231   It is not permissible for a non-Saudi by any means other than inheritance to acquire the right of ownership or the right of easement or usufruct over a property or land located within the borders of the cities of Mecca and Al-Madinah Al-Munawwarah.232  Royal Decree No. 22 of 2011, promulgating Cabinet Decree No. 91 of 2011, regulates real estate ownership in Saudi Arabia by citizens of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries, including Oman, Kuwait, Bahrain, United Arab Emirates and Qatar. 233  A citizen of one of the  227 Decree of the President of the Russian Federation No. 79 of Feb. 28, 2022, on Special Economic Measures in Relation to Unfriendly Actions of the United States of America and Allied Foreign States and International Organizations, https://perma.cc/E4T5-HQDR (in Russian).  228 Government of the Russian Federation, Regulation No. 430 of Mar. 5, 2022, on the List of Foreign States and Territories Committing Unfriendly Actions Against the Russian Federation, Russian Legal Entities and Individuals, https://perma.cc/8YMA-V53X (in Russian). 229 Decree of the Russian Federation President No. 81 of Mar. 1, 2022, on Additional Temporary Economic Measures to Ensure the Financial Stability of the Russian Federation, ConsultantPlus.ru, https://perma.cc/FD7G-26FB (in Russian). 230 Law on Real Estate Ownership and Investment by Non-Saudis, issued on 1421/01/01 Hijri corresponding to April 6, 2000 posted on the official website of the Cabinet,  https://perma.cc/L785-9BJY (in Arabic).  231 Id. art. 1.  232 Id. art. 5. 233 Royal Decree 22 of 2011, promulgating Cabinet decree no. 91 of 2011, on Real Estate Ownership by Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Nationals for Residential and Investment Purposes, issued on 1432/04/03 Hijri \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 43 aforementioned GCC countries (whether an entity or person) is allowed to rent and own built real estate and lands for the purpose of housing or investment in Saudi Arabia.234   If a GCC citizen purchases land, its construction or exploitation must be completed within four years from the date it was registered in his or her name.235 A GCC citizen who owns a real estate property (building) may dispose of this property at any time. However, if he or she owns land, the GCC citizen has the right to dispose of it after finishing its construction. If a GCC citizen has not conducted any constructions on the purchased land, he or she may dispose of it after four years from the date he or she registers the land under his or her name.236   South Africa   South Africa permits foreigners to own land.237 The only restriction placed on land ownership by foreigners is the prohibition under the Immigration Act on “letting or selling or in any manner making available any immoveable property in the Republic” to “illegal foreigners.”238  In 2017, the South African government proposed a bill, among others, aimed at barring acquisition of agricultural land by certain foreign persons.239 The restrictions as written would not extend to “Africans, Coloureds and Indians.”240 The restrictions would also not be applicable to permanent residents or juristic persons over which South African citizens or permanent residents have controlling interests.241 This bill has not been enacted.242  South Korea  Under the Act on Report on Real Estate Transaction, a sales contract involving real estate must be reported to a competent local government within 30 days from the date of the contract.243 This applies to Korean nationals and foreigners.

If it would disrupt the attainment, the foreigner cannot own the land.246 The principle of reciprocity also applies to land acquisition by foreigners.247   In the case of farmland, a person, including a foreigner, can obtain farmland for one’s own farming248 upon obtaining a qualification certificate from the local government,249 except for acquisition by inheritance and auction of mortgaged farmland, among others. 250   Under the Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, non-residents who intend to acquire real estate in South Korea must file a report with the Minister of Economy and Finance.251    Spain   The general rule is that natural and legal foreign nationals have the same rights as Spanish citizens to acquire property rights over land in the country, with the exceptions provided by Law 8/1975 over Zones of National Defense Interest.252  Under article 1 of the law, acquisition by foreigners of the following three types of land is restricted:  • zones of interest to the national defense,  • zones of security for military installations or civilian installations declared of military interest, and  • zones of restricted access by foreigners to the property.253    244 Id. art. 8. 245 Id. art. 9, para. 1. 246 Id. art. 9, para. 2. 247 Id. art. 7. 248 Farmland Act, Act No. 8352, Apr. 11, 2007, amended by Act No. 18021, Apr. 13, 2021, art 6, para. 1, https://perma.cc/56ZJ-MNAQ. 249 Id. art. 8. 250 Id. art. 6, para. 2, art. 8, para. 2.   251 Foreign Exchange Transactions Act, Act No. 5550, Sep. 16, 1998, as amended by Act No. 18244, June 15, 2021, art. 3, para. 1, subpara. 19(d), art. 18, para. 1. 252 Ley 8/1975, de Zonas e Instalaciones de Interés Para la Defensa Nacional, Mar. 12, 1975, https://perma.cc/P23X-Z988.  253 Id. art. 1. \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 45 Foreigners are banned from acquiring the first two types of property.

The same is true when foreign partners from states that are not in the European Union have a situation of dominance or prevalence in the company, as ascertained from any circumstance that allows verifying the existence of their decisive influence in the management of the company.255  Sweden   Sweden does not restrict the ownership of land based on nationality or citizenship. Specifically, the Code of Land Law does not restrict transfer of land based on citizenship.256 Moreover, the Property Development Act does not restrict property realignment, resizing, or transfer based on citizenship.257  However, there is currently a proposal pending before the Swedish parliament that would restrict foreign ownership in certain companies that operate in Sweden.258 It would require the prior notification of foreign ownership in businesses that pursue “activities worthy of protection.”259 Specifically, section 3 of the proposed act states that the following activities would be worthy of protection:  3 § In this Act, activities worthy of protection refer to 1. socially important activity, 2. security-sensitive activities according to the Security Protection Act (2018:585), 3. exploration, extraction, enrichment or sale of critical raw materials or metals or minerals that are otherwise strategically important for Sweden’s livelihood, 4. large-scale processing of sensitive personal data or location data in or through a good or service, 5. manufacturing or development of, research into or provision of dual-use products or provision of technical assistance for such products; 6. manufacturing or development of, research into or provision of military equipment according to the Act (1992:1300) on military equipment or providing maintenance of technical support regarding such military equipment, or  254 Id. art. 18. 255 Id. art. 19. 256 Chapter 4 e contrario Jordabalken (SFS 1970:994), https://perma.cc/WZR7-2SQN.  257 Fastighetsbildningslag (SFS 1970:988), https://perma.cc/QBC2-D9A6. 258 Justitiedepartementet, Lagrådsremiss Ett granskningssystem för utländska direktinvesteringar till skydd för svenska säkerhetsintressen, https://perma.cc/MJ5T-PM9Y. 259 Id.

Today, [Sweden] lacks a regulatory framework that provides sufficient conditions to prevent foreign investors’ strategic acquisition of companies whose operations, information or technology has significance for Sweden’s security or for public order or public safety in Sweden.261  The Swedish Law Council, which reviews proposed legislation, has recommended that the law be adopted but recommended that the law be clarified.262 If adopted, the law is scheduled to enter into force on December 1, 2023.263 The legislation comes following EU Regulation (EU) 2019/452 establishing a framework for the screening of foreign direct investments into the Union.264  Sweden has made no reservation with regard to land ownership under GATS XVII.265  Switzerland  Switzerland places restrictions on the acquisition of real property by foreigners to prevent the “foreign infiltration of native lands.”266 The Federal Act on the Acquisition of Real Estate by Persons Abroad (Bundesgesetz über den Erwerb von Grundstücken durch Personen im Ausland, BewG) and its related ordinance (Verordnung über den Erwerb von Grundstücken durch Personen im Ausland, BewV) provide that foreigners must obtain prior authorization from the competent cantonal authority to acquire real property. 267 Purchasing shares in a legal entity whose real purpose is the acquisition of real estate also qualifies as acquisition of real estate,  260 Id.

In addition, the following conditions must be satisfied:  • the types of businesses to be invested in must benefit the nation economically and socially or be businesses eligible for investment promotion under the law on investment promotion;  • the period for maintenance of the investment must be at least three years; • the area of land permitted to be acquired by aliens must be located within an area designated as a residential area under the law on town planning.286  Other laws also allow foreign ownership of land if conditions are met. A foreign company is eligible to obtain a certificate of promotion from the Board of Investment if the conditions under the Investment Promotion Act are met.287 A company that obtains the certificate is permitted to own the land required for the promoted business.288  In addition, under the Financial Institution Business Act, “commercial bank” includes a subsidiary of a foreign commercial bank and a branch of a foreign commercial bank that is licensed to carry on commercial banking business in Thailand.289 A commercial bank can own immovable properties if the properties are for reasonable use as business premises or as places of residence or welfare for its officers and employees, are acquired by the bank as a result of debt settlement (limited term for five years), or are purchased or held by a finance company engaging in the housing finance business.290   283 Land Code B.E. 2497 (1954), as amended by Land Code Amendment Act (No. 13) B.E. 2556 (2013), sec. 86, https://perma.cc/4F5L-53AE.  284 Robert M.

Pursuant to article 3 of the law, the right to own real estate is limited to citizens of the United Arab Emirates. 303   The same law restricts the right of ownership by a foreign national to buildings only and not to the lands where those buildings are constructed. Also, the right of a foreign national to own a property is limited to investment zones only.304 Foreigners have the right to usufruct of their residential units for 99 years.305 A foreign national has no right to dispose of the unit or the building before 10 years from the initial exercise of the right to usufruct or ownership.306   In contrast to Law No. 19 of 2005, which allows foreigners to own only the property (building) and not the land on which the property was built, Law No. 13 of 2019, amending Law No. 19 of 2015, permits foreign nationals and entities to own and acquire all rights over properties in the investment zones of Abu Dhabi.307 Article 3(2) of Law No. 13 of 2019 stipulates that a foreign national (whether a person or an entity) has the right to own and acquire all original and in-kind rights in real estate properties located within investment zones.   Additionally, Law No. 7 of 2006, on the registration of the ownership of a real estate property in the Emirate of Dubai, restricts the ownership by foreign nationals of lands and real estate properties, except in designated locations where the foreign nationals are allowed to own land or a real estate property.308   Law No. 7 of 2006 stipulates that the right to own a real property in Dubai shall be restricted to emeriti citizens and citizens of the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, including Oman, Kuwait, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain. Foreign nationals may be granted free right of ownership in certain locations, as determined by the Ruler of the Emirate.309   United Kingdom  There appear to be no prohibitions on the foreign ownership of property across the UK and a search of GATTS XVII reveals no reservations on land ownership.310 The only restriction on the foreign ownership of property in the UK is that “overseas entities that own land or property in  303Law No. 19 of 2005 on real estate in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, issued on Aug. 10, 2005, https://perma.cc/R8K6-PPH4 (in Arabic). 304 Id. art. 4 305 Id.  306 Id. art. 4, para 2.  307 Law No. 13 of 2019 amending Law No. 19 of 2005, Al-Jaridah Al-Rasmiyah [official gazette], vol.4, year 48, 30 Apr. 2019, https://perma.cc/5N4S-6H2D (in Arabic). 308 Law No. 7 of 2006, issued on March 13, 2006, posted on the government of the emirate of Dubai, Land Department official website, Real Estate Legislation book, pp-176-185, https://perma.cc/8XAT-QEP3. 309 Id. art. 4.  310 Schedules of Specific Commitments and Lists of Article II Exemptions, World Trade Organization, https://perma.cc/MM44-TAQQ.  \fRestrictions on Land Ownership by Foreigners in Selected Jurisdictions The Law Library of Congress 53 the UK [must] declare their beneficial owners and/or managing officers”311 on the Register of Overseas Entities.312 Without such registration, which is kept on a publicly available register held by the Companies House, an overseas entity will not be able to buy, sell, lease, or create a charge against land in the UK.313 The register brings the regime for beneficial owners of overseas entities into line with the regime for UK entities, which has a register for the beneficial owners of entities known as the “people with significant control” register.314   311 The New Register of Overseas Entities is Live, Gov.uk (Aug. 1, 2022), https://perma.cc/KC5Y-ERT2.  312 Economic Crime (Transparency and Enforcement) Act 2022, c. 10, https://perma.cc/YM2T-SHCD.  313 Id. 314 Summary Guide for Companies – Register of People with Significant Control, Gov.uk, https://perma.cc/WX2G-C9AL.

As of June 4, 2020, a total of 6.4 million confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported worldwide, with the most cases being reported in the United States (1.8 million), Brazil (555,383), and the Russian Federation (432,277).1 Of those cases, 383,872 people have died.2 COVID-19 is caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus and spreads from person to person through droplet and contact transmission. Currently, there is no known cure or vaccine. Countries therefore have to find other ways to control and mitigate the spread of this infectious disease in order to break the chain of human-to-human transmission, such as case identification, isolation, testing, contact tracing, quarantine, and location tracking.   Many governments have turned to electronic measures to provide information to individuals about the COVID-19 pandemic, check symptoms, trace contacts and alert persons who have been in proximity to an infected person, identify “hot spots,” and track compliance with confinement measures and stay-at-home orders. Dedicated coronavirus apps that are downloaded to an individual’s mobile phone, the use of anonymized mobility data, and creating electronic databases are the most common measures. However, it is unclear whether such digital solutions by themselves are sufficient to contain the spread of the virus. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends using digital proximity tracking only as a supplement to other measures such as increased testing and manual contact tracing.3   Most of the surveyed jurisdictions have developed one or several dedicated coronavirus apps with different functionalities, such as general information and advice about COVID-19, symptom checkers, and contact tracing and warning. In order to be effective and provide accurate information, the applications need enough data, meaning enough people need to download the app. Some countries had low download rates, or, as in the case of Norway, only initial high enthusiasm. Other problems observed were technical glitches in computer systems that led to false information being reported, which happened in Russia, where people were erroneously fined or fined several times. In the UK, there were reports that the app was unable to work properly if another app was being actively used.                                                  1 WHO Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Dashboard, World Health Organization [WHO], https://perma.cc/567D-J854.  2 Id. 3 WHO, Ethical Considerations to Guide the Use of Digital Proximity Tracking Technologies for COVID-19 Contact Tracing 1 (May 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/5NRA-XUFA.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 2  In the majority of the surveyed jurisdictions, the download of a COVID-19 app is voluntary. The EU in non-binding guidance to Member States recommended the use of voluntary apps because of the “high degree of intrusiveness” of mandatory apps. However, some exceptions were observed. In the UK, a body established to consider the ethics of the app noted that it would be possible to require the app for individuals returning to work or using public transportation. In Argentina, installing the contact tracing app is generally voluntary; however, people who enter the country from abroad and people who return to work are obligated to install it. India’s contact tracing app’s use was considered voluntary when launched in early April but became mandatory for public- and private-sector employees in early May. This requirement was eased in late May after criticism from privacy and digital rights organizations. In China, even though the health code apps that assign different color codes to people depending on their infection status appear not to have been made compulsory, they are de facto compulsory in many cities as citizens without the code are not able to enter most public places. In Turkey, travelers whose HES codes on their app indicate that they were diagnosed as positive or have been in contact with a person diagnosed as such are not allowed to use public transportation or airplanes. In Russia, all people identified as having been in contact with an infected individual must install the “Social Monitoring app” or face a fine. Individuals with no cell phone receive special devices with a preinstalled Social Monitoring app. And, as noted below, in some countries persons required to quarantine must install an app to allow the authorities to monitor their movement.   Some of the surveyed jurisdictions have also established databases in which the health information of infected persons is logged. South Africa established an interim database in which health care professionals who test a person for COVID-19 must enter the person’s identification and contact information, including cellphone number, for inclusion in the database. The French government has developed two electronic databases, one where all COVID-19 test results are recorded and one to facilitate contact tracing. The data in both systems may only be accessed by medical professionals who are subject to medical confidentiality. In China, the health code apps reportedly rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user, COVID-19 databases set up by government authorities, and data held by other sources, including the public transportation, telecommunications, and banking sectors.  Technology is also used to measure compliance with quarantine measures or stay-at-home orders. South Korea has developed an electronic wristband that monitors people’s compliance with self-quarantine; however, it is not mandatory and violators must consent to wearing it. Spain used mobile phone location data to track people’s movements and verify how closely the nationwide lockdown was being observed. Norway used telecommunication data to determine whether people complied with travel restrictions during the month of March 2020; however, no individuals were targeted by that approach. In Russia, QR codes that serve as digital passes were required to use public transportation for the self-isolated population. Taiwan’s “digital fence” monitors the location of those required to undergo home quarantine via their own cellphones or government-issued cellphones, with the goal of preventing their movement. In the United Arab Emirates, people who are ordered to quarantine must install an app, which sends alerts to them to stay within the range of movement allowed during the quarantine and provides health authorities with the precise location of these individuals.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 3 Furthermore, a few selected surveyed countries have used other electronic means to fight the spread of COVID-19. The Italian Civil Aviation Authority has approved the use of drones by local police to monitor social distancing. Israel has utilized the surveillance technologies of the Israel Security Agency (ISA) to trace patients and those with whom they came into contact during the period from mid-March 2020 to early June 2020. In response to a ruling by the Israeli Supreme Court requiring the ISA activities to be defined in legislation and public criticism over privacy concerns, the government announced on June 8, 2020, that it would no longer utilize ISA surveillance for tracing COVID-19 patients or promote relevant legislation in this regard unless a new outbreak takes place.  However, these electronic measures also raise privacy and data protection concerns, in particular as they relate to sensitive health data. Appropriate safeguards have to be put in place to ensure that the electronic measures are necessary and proportionate, such as consent, data minimization, privacy by design, transparency, nondiscrimination, security of data, deletion or anonymization of data once it is no longer necessary, and oversight mechanisms, among others. South Korea, for example, has been criticized for releasing a detailed log of movements of COVID-19 patients, including the time and names of places they visited, through the media and related websites. The European Data Protection Board has voiced concerns with regard to apps that use location tracking as they violate the principle of data minimization. In Australia, critics voiced concerns that United States law enforcement entities could gain access to the app data, because the data is being hosted in Australia by Amazon Web Services, a US company subject to the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act). Iceland’s app, on the other hand, has received international recognition as one of the least invasive apps from a privacy perspective.   Some countries conducted rights impact assessments before the measures were deployed to ensure that individual rights would not be violated and to promote public acceptance, or had data protection agencies conduct an assessment after deployment. The French government sought advice from the independent National Commission on Information Technology and Freedoms (CNIL) twice before the introduction of the app. The Turkish Data Protection Authority released two guidance documents discussing privacy and data protection concerns with regard to electronic measures to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. In Australia, the Department of Health engaged a law firm to prepare a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to advise the Department on how it needed to address and mitigate any identified privacy risks with regard to the COVIDSafe app. The PIA was published online. The Norwegian supervisory authority for the collection and use of personal data started an investigation after the introduction of the app to ensure that it complies with the Norwegian regulation on tracing and epidemic contagion related to COVID-19.

The law on data privacy governs the management of health information under the health emergency. The Ministry of Health has launched the CuidAR COVID-19 free application for mobile phones, for self-diagnosis and health care guidance. It is also used to process the Unique Circulation Enabling Certificate, which allows certain people to circulate amid the lockdown. It is also used to track the spread of the virus through geo-localization. Its use is not mandatory, except for travelers entering the country and those exempted from the lockdown and returning to work.    I.  Introduction   Argentina declared a state of health emergency due to the COVID-19 epidemic for one year through the Decree of Necessity and Urgency [DECNU] 260/2020 starting on March 12, 2020.1 It further mandated a lockdown through DECNU 297/2020, until March 31, 2020, which was extended until May 24, 2020.2 The lockdown was to remain in place in Buenos Aires through at least June 7.3  There were 9,931 Covid-19 cases in Argentina as of May 22, 2020, and 419 deaths, according to the report from the government, which is updated daily.4 This information is available in a New COVID-19 dedicated section in the Ministry of Health website, where all information, recommendations, FAQs, etc., are available.5  Of a population of almost 45 million,6 there are approximately 40 million mobile phone users in Argentina, and 1.3 million users have already downloaded and used the government app CuidAR COVID-19, which is managed by the Ministry of Health and aimed at the protection and                                                  1 Decreto de Necesidad y Urgencia (DECNU) 260/2020, art. 1, Mar. 12, 2020,  Boletín Oficial [B.O.] 34327, https://perma.cc/2VEH-G6SF. 2 DECNU 297/2020 Aislamiento Social Preventivo y Obligatorio, Mar. 19, 2020, B.O. 34334, https://perma.cc/9QFN-CJ68, and DECNU 459/2020 Extensión, May 11, 2020, B.O. 34377, https://perma.cc/8KB6-GNLA. 3 DECNU 493/2020 Aislamiento Social Preventivo y Obligatorio Extensión, B.O.

Privacy and Data ProtectionThe Agency for Access to Public Information (AAIP) has issued an statement on the treatment of health-related private information under the current health emergency, which must be carried out in compliance with data privacy rules under Ley 25326 de Protección de Datos Personales (LPDP).8 The fundamental principles of the LPDP applicable to personal health data are as follows: •Health data are considered sensitive and therefore warrant more rigorous protection.9•The disclosure of the identity of a Covid-19 patient requires his or her consent.10•Health care facilities and professionals can process and transfer patient data to each otheronly under professional confidentiality standards.11•Professional confidentiality will remain effective even after the relationship with the patienthas ended.12•To use patient information for purposes other than his or her medical treatment, the patientmust give a full, free and informed consent.13•The National and Provincial Ministries of Health have the authority to request, collect, andtransfer to each other or, in any other way, process health information without the patient’sconsent, in accordance with their explicit and implicit competences assigned by law.147 Cómo Funciona CuidAR, la Nueva App de Coronavirus Argentina, Ambito (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/H3UJ-4VNP. 8 Ley 25326 de Protección de Datos Personales, Nov. 2, 2000, B.O. 29517, https://perma.cc/NE2W-72LH, and Tratamiento de Datos Personales ante el Coronavirus, AAIP (Mar. 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/SB6R-DQZ5. 9 Ley 25326 arts. 2 & 7. 10 Id. art. 5. 11 Id. art. 8. 12 Id. art. 10. 13 Id. arts. 4.3 and 5. 14 Id. arts. 5.2 and 11.3.b. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Argentina The Law Library of Congress 7 • Any person who considers that his or her privacy or personal data is being affected has the right to file a complaint with the AAIP.15  B. Location Tracking  Under DECNU 260/2020, the Ministry of Health is empowered to adopt all recommendations and measures necessary to mitigate the health impact of the COVID-19 epidemic.16 It further provides that the Ministry of Health is required to provide information to the public about the epidemic , regarding the spread, containment, and mitigation of the virus, while always keeping affected people’s identity confidential and complying with professional secrecy standards.17   The public health measures taken within the authority granted under DECNU 260/2020 have to be the least restrictive of rights as possible and should be based on acceptable scientific criteria.18 People affected by these measures will be guaranteed their rights, especially the right to be informed about their health status, the right to nondiscrimination in access to health care, and the right to dignified treatment.19  Violations of measures adopted under the health emergency are subject to applicable administrative sanctions or to criminal penalties provided under the Penal Code, such as imprisonment for six months to two years.20  III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  The Ministry of Health has launched the CuidAR COVID-19 free app, available on iOS and Android systems.21 On its first day of operation, it had more than 100,000 users, and 500,000 auto tests were carried out.22  This app allows people to diagnose themselves through a platform and then receive recommendations on the steps to follow if they have symptoms that coincide with the coronavirus and information on care and prevention.23 The new app enables a user to check                                                  15 Id. 16 DNU 260/2020 art. 2, paras 1 & 16; art. 20. 17 Id. art. 3. 18 Id. art. 21. 19 Id.  20 Id. art. 22 and Código Penal art. 205, Nov. 3, 1921, B.O. 8300, https://perma.cc/J3BJ-PPAJ. 21 COVID-19, Ministerio de Salud, https://perma.cc/34XX-C5FS. 22 Martín Torino, Coronavirus: La App para Detectar Síntomas Sumó 500,000 Autotests en su Primer Día, Cronista (Mar. 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/EJV5-P4SE. 23 Cómo Funciona CuidAr la Nueva App de Coronavirus Argentina, Ambito (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/FM2A-CNYL. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Argentina The Law Library of Congress 8 symptoms related to the disease without the need to leave home, avoiding the need to go to a medical center and potentially spread the virus, thus easing the strain on the health care system.24  The CuidAr-COVID-19 app requires the user to enter his or her personal data and mobile number and share their geo-location. In addition, the address, locality and province where the person is undergoing quarantine must be declared, to enable the health emergency protocol to be activated if necessary.25  To perform the self-diagnosis, the user must answer questions about his or her body temperature, other symptoms, and preexisting diseases.26  The app also provides access to the Unique Circulation Enabling Certificate, which allows its holder to circulate when meeting the requirements for the exceptions to the circulation restrictions issued by the government during the health emergency.27    The app includes a special section on the use of personal data in its terms and conditions, where the user has the option to give consent to the release of personal health data. The information provided is protected by law and is for the exclusive use of the health authorities.28     For people who enter the country from abroad, the use of the app is mandatory for a period of 14 days, according to Disposición 1771/2020 of the Dirección Nacional de Migraciones [DNM].29 In the case of minors or people with disabilities, the father, mother or legal representative will have to complete the required data on their behalf.30   The DNM has the authority to require travelers prior to entering the country and travelers who return from abroad to comply by downloading the app or entering the information requested on the app website, which informs its users about the terms and conditions for its use.31  Once downloaded, Decisión Administrativa 432/2020 requires the traveler to keep it installed and active for a minimum period of 14 calendar days from its activation.32 This allows the DNM                                                  24 Id. 25 Id. 26 Id. 27 Id. 28 Id. 29 Disposición 1771/2020, Aplicación COVID-19—Ministerio de Salud.

A new law, which will enter into force in August 2020, has been enacted for the purpose of protecting personal data.   In an effort to help track the spread of COVID-19, the government enacted a Provisional Measure for data sharing by telecommunications companies to support the generation of official statistics. However, the Brazilian Federal Supreme Court later issued an injunction suspending the Provisional Measure as a preliminary response to several Direct Unconstitutionality Actions that were filed by different entities. The federal government has also issued a law specifying measures that may be adopted by the authorities within the scope of their competences to address the public health emergency resulting from the COVID-19 outbreak. I. IntroductionOn May 22, 2020, Brazil’s Ministry of Health registered 310,987 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 20,047 deaths in the country.1 According to the National Agency of Telecommunications (Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações, ANATEL), in February 2020 Brazilians had 227.1 million active cell phones.2   II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionOn August 14, 2018, Brazil enacted Law No. 13,709, the General Data Protection Law (Lei Geral de Proteção de Dados), which provides for the processing of personal data, including digital media, by either a natural person or a public or private legal entity in a manner that protects a person’s fundamental rights of freedom, privacy, and free development of personality.3 The new law will enter into force in August 2020. 4 1 Coronavírus Brasil, Ministério da Saúde, https://covid.saude.gov.br/. 2 Agência Nacional de Telecomunicações, https://www.anatel.gov.br/paineis/acessos/telefonia-movel.For comparison purposes, on July 1, 2019, the Brazilian population was estimated to be approximately 210.15 million persons.

Data Retention and Location Tracking  1.  Provisional Measure No. 954 of April 20, 2020  On April 17, 2020, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro enacted Provisional Measure11 No. 954, which provides for data sharing between telecommunications companies that offer Fixed Switched Telephone Services (Serviço Telefônico Fixo Comutado, STFC) and Personal Mobile Services (Serviço Móvel Pessoal, SMP) and the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics Foundation (Fundação Instituto Brasileiro de Geografia e Estatística, IBGE), for the purpose of supporting the generation of official statistics during the COVID-19 public health emergency,12 which Law No. 13,979, of February 6, 2020, deals with.13  Telecommunication companies providing STFC and SMP must make available to the IBGE, in electronic form, a list of names, telephone numbers, and addresses of their consumers, whether individual persons or companies.14 The data will be used directly and exclusively by the IBGE for                                                              5 Id. art. 2. 6 Id. art. 3. 7 Id. art. 4. 8 Id. art. 6. 9 Id. art. 7(I), (II), (VIII). 10 Id. art. 11. 11 Article 62 of the Brazilian Constitution determines that in relevant and urgent cases, the President of the Republic may adopt provisional measures that have the force of law.  Such measures must be submitted immediately to the National Congress.

Database and Tracking Systems  On April 12, 2020, a Brazilian newspaper reported that a group of telephone companies were planning to make a large database available to the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications based on information from their transmission towers, which could identify the movement of people.20 A similar project has also been implemented in the State of São Paulo.21 In addition to large corporations like Google and Facebook who are also developing similar tracking projects, the Brazilian startup InLoco has created a map of social isolation in the country22 divided by states, the newspaper reported.23    According to the website of the startup, the social isolation index was developed to combat the COVID-19 pandemic. The map shows the percentage of the population that is respecting the isolation recommendation. The purpose of the map is to assist authorities in directing the application of public security, communication, and health resources to the appropriate areas.24                                                                15 Id. art. 2(§ 1). 16 Id. art. 3. 17 Id. art. 3(§ 1). 18 Id. art. 3(§ 2). 19 Id. art. 4. 20 Uso de Dados de Localização no Combate à COVID-19 Pode Ameaçar Privacidade, Estadão, Link (Apr. 12, 2020), https://perma.cc/87Y2-TNKQ.  21 Id. 22 Id. 23 Mapa Brasileiro da COVID-19, InLoco, https://perma.cc/J6RZ-6M9P (click “See the Screenshot View”).  24 Id. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 14 Furthermore, the newspaper stated that the telephone companies will use the data in an aggregate manner, which means that governments would not have access to individualized information, but only compiled data to indicate major trends.25 At the end of the pandemic emergency the database will cease to be used, but during the emergency the information will be stored on a publicly owned server. The government will decide what will be done with the data and with what institutions to share it with.  III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread   A.  Dedicated Coronavirus App to Stop Spread of the Virus  On March 2, 2020, the Ministry of Health launched the Coronavirus–SUS app for the purpose of making the population aware of COVID-19. The app provides information on various topics such as symptoms, how to prevent infection, what to do in the case of suspected or actual infection, and other relevant information. It also provides a map indicating the location of nearby health units.26  B.  Compatibility of Measures with Privacy Rights/Data Protection Principles  1.  Federal Supreme Court Injunction  On April 24, 2020, Justice Rosa Weber of the Federal Supreme Court (Supremo Tribunal Federal, STF) granted an injunction (medida cautelar) suspending Provisional Measure No. 954, as requested in five Direct Unconstitutionality Actions (Ação Direta de Inconstitucionalidade, ADI) proposed by the Federal Council of the Brazilian Bar Association (ADI 6387) and four different political parties (ADIs 6388, 6389, 6390, and 6393).27 In the preliminary analysis of the actions, Justice Weber pointed out that   the information under [Provisional Measure No.] 954 is within the scope of constitutional protection (article 5 of the Constitution), which supports the right to personal intimacy, private life, honor and reputation of people. . . . [T]he MP does not foresee any requirement of mechanisms and procedures to ensure the confidentiality and anonymity of the shared data, which does not meet the requirements established in the Constitution for the effective protection of fundamental rights of Brazilians.28    Justice Weber also highlighted that there is no legitimate public interest in sharing the personal data of users of telephone services and that the standard does not provide conditions for assessing their suitability and need, as it does not define the form or purpose of the use of the data collected, in apparent violation of the law. She further added that the seriousness and urgency resulting from the current health crisis cannot be underestimated, nor the need to formulate public policies that demand                                                              25 Id. 26 Coronavirus – SUS, Governo do Brasil, https://perma.cc/A9SM-JDFS.   27 Ministra suspende MP que prevê compartilhamento de dados com o IBGE por empresas de telecomunicações durante pandemia, Notícias STF (Apr. 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/R5LU-KQU3.  28 Id.

However, she stated that the fight against the pandemic cannot legitimize “the trampling of fundamental guarantees enshrined in the Constitution.”29  Under these arguments, Justice Weber granted the injunction “in order to prevent irreparable damage to the intimacy and confidentiality of the privacy of more than one hundred million users of fixed and mobile telephone services,” and determined that the IBGE must refrain from requesting the data provided for in Provisional Measure No. 954. If the information has already been requested, the request must be suspended, with immediate communication to the telephone companies, she said.   Justice Weber’s decision will be submitted to the plenary of the STF for analysis and confirmation.30  2.  Use of Geolocation Halted  Under the justification that privacy risks need to be better evaluated, President Jair Bolsonaro determined that the Ministry of Science, Technology, Innovations and Communications should halt negotiations with telephone companies concerning the use by the federal government of aggregated and anonymous geolocation information from several citizens. The information had been sought as a means to monitor what percentage of people in a given region are following the government’s guidance to stay at home as much as possible.31  C.   Consequences for People Who Have Been in Close Contact with Infected Persons  Law No. 13,979 provides that the authorities may adopt, within the scope of their competences, the following measures to address the COVID-19 outbreak:  I - isolation; II - quarantine; III - determination of compulsory: a) medical examinations; b) laboratory tests; c) collection of clinical samples; d) vaccination and other prophylactic measures; or e) specific medical treatments.32  For the purposes of Law No. 13, 979, “isolation” is defined as the separation from others of sick or contaminated persons, or of luggage, means of transportation, goods, or affected postal parcels, in order to avoid contamination or the spread of the coronavirus. “Quarantine” is defined                                                              29 Id. 30 Id. 31 Mariana Schreiber, Coronavírus: uso de dados de geolocalização contra a pandemia põe em risco sua privacidade?, BBC News Brasil (Apr. 21, 2020), https://perma.cc/KAB9-7QNU.  32 Lei No. 13.979 of February 6, 2020, art. 3, https://perma.cc/HT6U-7RSA (translation by author). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Brazil The Law Library of Congress 16 as the restriction of activities or separation of persons suspected of contamination from persons who are not sick, or the separation of luggage, containers, animals, means of transportation, or goods suspected of being contaminated, in order to avoid possible contamination or the spread of the coronavirus.33   People must comply with these measures and a failure to comply will result in liability, as provided by law.34                                                              33 Id. art. 2. 34 Id. art. 3(§ 4). \fThe Law Library of Congress 17 Mexico  Gustavo Guerra Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY As of May 22, 2020, mandatory electronic measures to combat COVID-19, such as location tracking of, and contact tracing through, mobile devices, had not been ordered by Mexico’s federal government. The government has released a voluntary mobile coronavirus application, “Covid-19MX,” aimed at assisting users to locate pertinent information on a number of matters related to the virus, including access to epidemiological health care telephone numbers and a self-diagnosis tool. Certain issues have been reported concerning the privacy policy of this app.    I. Introduction  According to data provided by the Mexican government, there were 62,527 confirmed cases of individuals who contracted COVID-19 and 6,989 deaths from the virus as of May 22, 2020.1 However, Mexican officials have reportedly acknowledged that the number of cases is perhaps several times higher due to Mexico’s low rate of testing.2 Mexico, which has a population of over 125 million, has conducted approximately 230,000 tests to date, one of the lowest rates in the Western Hemisphere.3  In 2019 there were approximately 86.5 millions of users of cellphones in the country, 90% of whom had a smartphone, according to a government survey.4 The survey indicates that 48.3 million cell phone users installed apps on their devices in 2019.5 Most of these apps were for social media, instant messaging, and traffic information.6 The surveyed individuals did not report having downloaded applications for health purposes.7                                                     1 Comunicado Técnico Diario COVID-19, Gobierno de México, Secretaría de Salud (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/PWQ2-WQNR.  2 Mexico Hit New Virus Record of over 500 Deaths Per Day, Associated Press (May 26, 2020), https://perma.cc/64NB-B9WP?type=image.  3 Id. 4 Press Release, Instituto Nacional de Estadística y Geografía et al., En México hay 80.6 millones de usuarios de internet y 86.5 millones de usuarios de teléfonos celulares: ENDUTIH 2019 (Feb. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/NNY9-35YH.  5 Id. 6 Id. 7 Id. \fThe Law Library of Congress 18 Regulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Mexico II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data Protection “Personal data” are defined as any information pertaining to an identified or identifiable individual.8 An individual is deemed to be identifiable when his or her identity may be directly or indirectly determined from any information.9  “Sensitive personal data” are those that refer to the individual’s most private information and those whose misuse may lead to discrimination against, or involve a serious risk to, the data’s owner, including his or her health status.10 The processing of personal data must adhere to the principles of consent, lawfulness, purpose, proportionality, and responsibility.11 As a general rule, sensitive data may be processed provided that express consent is granted for such purpose.12 There are a number of exceptions to this rule, however, including cases where personal data are needed to provide preventive treatment or diagnosis when providing health care, and when the data have been subject to a prior disaggregation procedure.13 Through such procedure, personal data cannot be associated with the owner.14 In the absence of these exceptions, consent must be specifically granted and based on the privacy policy provided by the recipient of the data.15 The privacy policy must inform individuals, in clear terms, of the existence and main characteristics of the processing to which their personal data will be subjected so that they can make informed decisions.16 B. Data Retention and Location Tracking1. Health LawMexico’s health authorities have broad powers to prevent and control communicable diseases, including observation of human and animal contacts, to the extent required.17 In places where a communicable disease acquires serious epidemic characteristics as determined by the 8 Ley General de Protección de Datos Personales en Posesión de Sujetos Obligados art. 3-IX, Diario Oficial de la Federacion [DOF], Jan. 26, 2017, as originally enacted, https://perma.cc/R9EX-757C.  9 Id. 10 Id. art. 3-X. 11 Id. art. 16. 12 Id. art. 7. 13 Id. art. 22(VII), (IX). 14 Id. art. 3(XIII), (XXXI). 15 Id. art. 20. 16 Id. art. 26. 17 Ley General de Salud arts. 134-XIV, 139-III, DOF, Feb. 7, 1984, as amended, https://perma.cc/A744-J9NZ. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Mexico The Law Library of Congress 19 Department of Health, as well as in adjoining places, private citizens and civil and military authorities must cooperate with health authorities in combatting such disease.18     2.  Telecommunications Law  In addition, telecommunications companies must cooperate with law enforcement authorities in locating, in real time, mobile communications devices.19 Furthermore, these companies must keep records of communications that are made from any type of line that allows for the accurate identification of pertinent data, including the following:  • Subscriber’s name or corporate name and address • Type of communication (voice, voicemail, conferencing, data) • Multimedia or messaging services employed (including short message services, multimedia, and advanced services) • Information needed to trace and identify the source and destination of the mobile telephone, including the destination number • Date, time, and duration of communications, as well as the messaging or multimedia services involved • Digital location of the geographic positioning of telephone lines20  The data retention obligation begins on the date on which the communication took place.21 For the first 12 months telecommunications companies must store these data on systems that allow their delivery in real time to law enforcement authorities through electronic means.22 Once this period is over, data must be retained in electronic storage systems for an additional 12 months, during which information must be delivered to the competent authorities within 48 hours from the time a pertinent request for such data is made.23  Telecommunications companies must take the necessary technical measures concerning the data being kept to guarantee their conservation, care, protection, and nonmanipulation, and must prevent unlawful access, destruction, alteration, or cancellation.24                                                     18 Id. arts. 140, 141, 147.  19 Ley Federal de Telecomunicaciones y Radiodifusión art. 190-I, DOF, July 14, 2014, as amended, https://perma.cc/SAY4-JHC8.   20 Id. art. 190-II. 21 Id. 22 Id. 23 Id. 24 Id. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Mexico The Law Library of Congress 20 III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  As of May 22, 2020, mandatory electronic measures to combat COVID-19, such as location tracking of, and contact tracing through, mobile devices, had not been ordered by Mexico’s federal government.25 A high-ranking official with the National Institute for Access to Information (Instituto Nacional de Transparencia, Acceso a la Información y Protección de Datos Personales, INAI), Mexico’s main authority on privacy matters, recently indicated that if the government decides to conduct geolocation tracking measures through electronic means, it should do so in consultation with INAI to ensure that private data are treated in accordance with applicable privacy requirements.26  The Mexican government has released a voluntary mobile coronavirus app, called “Covid-19MX,” aimed at assisting users in locating the following information related to the virus:  • Direct access to epidemiological health care telephone numbers. • Self-diagnosis: In case of suspicion that the user or a family member have contracted the virus, the app offers a questionnaire to obtain pertinent recommendations, depending on the data provided. • Locations of healthcare providers close to the user’s location, provided that geolocation permission is activated. • Relevant information to understand how COVID-19 is transmitted, the most vulnerable groups and prevention measures. • News: Access to official information, including press conferences and statements from Mexico’s Ministry of Health.27  Socialtic, a nonprofit organization specialized in technology matters, reviewed this app in April 2020 and criticized its privacy policy, as it contains the following information:  • It indicates that personal data may be provided to third parties, but does not specify with whom and for what purposes. • It omits the data that the app collects from the phone and other programs to which permissions are granted.                                                  25 Se Declara como Emergencia Sanitaria la Epidemia Generada por Covid-19, Gobierno de México, https://perma.cc/7VPP-B748.  26 Press Release, INAI, Ante pandemia, la salud pública es bien prioritario, pero no se puede descuidar la privacidad de las personas: Acuña Llamas (Apr. 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/CXE2-JNX5. 27 Descarga la app Covid-19, Gobierno de México, https://perma.cc/NRJ7-RMYM; see also Covid-19, Google Play, https://perma.cc/BVJ7-C9YD.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Mexico The Law Library of Congress 21 • It reserves the right to make any update to the privacy notice without prior notice. • It indicates that the Ministry of Health is not responsible for the use or misuse of the content of the application.28                                                     28 Análisis de la App COVID-19MX – Resumen, Socialtic (Apr. 6, 2020), https://perma.cc/XGC9-JNVV.  \f East Asia, South Asia and Pacific  \fThe Law Library of Congress 22 Australia Kelly Buchanan Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY The Australian government launched the COVIDSafe mobile phone application on April 26, 2020. The app uses Bluetooth signals to record a user’s contacts with other users and saves the encrypted information on their phone; it does not record location information. The contact data of a user who tests positive for COVID-19 can be uploaded to a central storage system and accessed by state and territory authorities as part of their contact tracing processes. The app is voluntary to download and users must grant permission for their data to be uploaded. The most recent figures available show that around 23% of Australians have downloaded the app.    The collection, use, and disclosure of personal information by various entities in Australia is primarily governed by the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth). This Act applies to federal government agencies and to entities with annual revenues over a certain threshold. In addition, most states and territories have privacy and health information laws that apply to state and territory government agencies and public-sector health service providers. The use and disclosure of telecommunications and related data by mobile phone carriers, including for purposes of law enforcement and national security, is governed by specific legislation. The laws include requirements to retain certain data about telecommunications and to provide assistance to relevant government entities, including in relation to encrypted information.   At the time of its launch, use of the COVIDSafe app and the data collected were subject to a privacy policy and a determination that set out various privacy protections and prohibited people or organizations from coercing others to download or use the app. On May 15, 2020, a bill that replicated and extended those rules and protections was enacted. The bill inserted a new part into the Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) that, for example, defines the data that is collected by the app; contains rules and offenses regarding access to and use of that data; provides for oversight, complaint processes, and reporting requirements related to the app; and sets out a process for determining the end of the data period, at which point data stored in the central system will be deleted.   The COVIDSafe legislation excludes the application of other Australian laws that might allow data to be accessed, including the telecommunications laws referred to above, meaning that the data collected by the app cannot be accessed by law enforcement or national security agencies. However, some commentators remain concerned that agencies in the United States may be able to gain access to the data pursuant to the CLOUD Act because the central storage system is hosted in Australia by Amazon Web Services, a US company. They argue that the reciprocal agreement currently being negotiated between Australia and the US should specifically exclude COVIDSafe app data.     \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 23 I.  Introduction  The Commonwealth of Australia is a federation of six states. In addition, two mainland territories have been granted a limited right of self-government and are often treated in a similar way to states: the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory.1 Under the country’s constitutional structure and relevant laws, plans, and arrangements,2 the states and territories have primary responsibility for a range of public health measures related to responding to the COVID-19 pandemic, including testing and contact tracing, physical distancing requirements, and travel restrictions between jurisdictions.3 National coordination mechanisms involve the federal Department of Health and the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee (AHPPC), while federal government responsibilities include national border measures, acquisition and distribution of certain supplies, and the country’s economic response to the pandemic.4   As of May 22, 2020, a total of 7,095 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Australia, including 101 deaths.5 The country’s response to the pandemic has been recognized internationally for its ability to restrict the outbreak and resulting deaths,6 with an infection rate of around 280 per million people and a fatality rate of four per million people.7  On April 26, 2020, the federal government launched a mobile phone application, COVIDSafe, that records contacts between individual users through the use of Bluetooth wireless signals.8 The app is available nationwide for voluntary download on both iOS and Android operating systems and the data can be accessed by state and territory authorities to supplement existing contact tracing                                                              1 State and Territory Government, Australia.gov.au, https://perma.cc/W6ZX-KPJJ.  2 See, e.g., Department of Health, Australian Health Sector Emergency Response Plan for Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) (last updated Feb. 7, 2020), https://perma.cc/PNA9-UAWW; Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, CDPLAN: Emergency Response Plan for Communicable Disease Incidents of National Significance (Sept. 2016), https://perma.cc/286R-VBG2.   3 See Australian Government Solicitor, Australian Jurisdictions Responses to COVID-19 (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/HK4C-732Y.  4 Id.; Government Response to the COVID-19 Outbreak, Department of Health, https://perma.cc/H4YZ-ADR2; Karen Elphick, Australian COVID-19 Response Management Arrangements: A Quick Guide (Parliamentary Library, Apr. 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/LXV8-8XS7; Karen Elphick, Australian Pandemic Response Planning: A Quick Guide (Parliamentary Library, Apr. 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/3FWW-WULH; Karen Elphick, National Emergency and Disaster Response Arrangements in Australia: A Quick Guide (Parliamentary Library, Apr. 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/KB2X-9E94.    5 Coronavirus (COVID-19) at a Glance, Department of Health, https://perma.cc/F6QN-PKZG.  6 See, e.g., Nectar Gan, How Did Australia Flatten Its Coronavirus Curve?

The more people who download this important public health app, the safer they and their family will be, the safer their community will be and the sooner we can safely lift restrictions and get back to business and do the things we love.”11  Within just over 24 hours after the app was launched, two million Australians, or around 8% of the population, had downloaded the app.12 On May 20, 2020, the Minister for Health stated that there had been 5.9 million downloads of the app,13 which equates to around 23% of the total population.  According to a national survey conducted by consulting company Deloitte in 2019, 91% of Australians have a smartphone device.14 At the time the app was first launched, the Minister for Health issued a determination containing certain rules and restrictions regarding the use of the collected data and prohibiting anyone from coercing others to download or use the app. Subsequently, on May 4, 2020, the government published draft legislation to replace and extend the rules in the determination.15 The final bill was introduced in the federal Parliament on May 12, 2020. It was passed on May 14, 2020, and received assent on May 15, 2020.16  II. Legal FrameworkA.

Exceptions include, for example, where the secondary use or disclosure is authorized by or under an Australian law or court order,19 where a “permitted general situation” exists (including where the use or disclosure is necessary to lessen or prevent a serious threat to life, health, or safety of any individual, or to public health and safety),20 and where a “permitted health situation” exists (including where the use or disclosure is necessary for research relevant to public health or public safety, or for the compilation or analysis of statistics relevant to public health or safety).21 The Act also contains additional specific provisions related to health information that apply to all private-sector health service providers in Australia.22   The government may declare a national emergency or disaster under the Privacy Act.23 When such a declaration is in effect, an entity may collect, use, or disclose personal information relating to an individual involved in the emergency or disaster, where such dealing with the information is for a permitted purpose in relation to the emergency or disaster.24 These provisions were most recently applied in early 2020 in the context of the Australian bushfires; no declaration has been made with respect to the COVID-19 pandemic.25   The Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC) is responsible for various privacy functions, including receiving complaints and investigating possible breaches of the Privacy Act.26 Several other federal laws also relate to privacy, including the telecommunications laws discussed below.27 In addition, most states and territories have privacy and health information laws that apply to state and territory government agencies and public-sector health service                                                              18 Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) sch 1; Australian Privacy Principles, OAIC, https://perma.cc/38SF-FNGM.  19 Privacy Act 1988 (Cth) sch 1 APP 6.2(b). 20 APP 6.2(c) & s 16A(1) item 1. 21 APP 6.2(d) & s 16B(3).

Data Retention and Location Tracking  1.  Use and Disclosure of Information under the Telecommunications Act 1997   The Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) contains provisions related to the use and disclosure of personal information by “carriers” (entities holding a carrier license for the provision of the infrastructure on which carriage and content services are provided to the public) and “carriage service providers” (providers of phone and/or internet services to the public).31 This specifically includes “location information” with respect to mobile phones and other mobile communications devices.32   Under the Act, the disclosure or use of protected information is allowed in limited circumstances, including where it is required or authorized under a warrant or by or under law,33 where there are reasonable grounds for believing that disclosure or use of the information “is reasonably necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of a person,”34  and disclosure to an emergency management person “for a purpose connected with persons being alerted to an emergency or likely emergency.”35 Disclosures in these circumstances are deemed to be authorized by the Privacy Act.36   The Act also requires that carriers and carriage service providers give authorities “such help as is reasonably necessary” for the purposes of enforcing the criminal law and laws imposing pecuniary penalties, protecting the public revenue, and safeguarding national security.37                                                                28 See Privacy in Your State, OAIC, https://perma.cc/QGW7-AN69.  29 Coronavirus (COVID-19): Understanding Your Privacy Obligations to Your Staff, OAIC (Mar. 18, 2020), https://perma.cc/C8DB-R4S4.  30 COVID-19, OAIC (May 5, 2020), https://perma.cc/FBC5-E4GP; COVID-19 Response from Australian Privacy Regulators, OAIC (Mar. 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/QZX7-6D9G.  31 Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) ss 5, 7 (definition of “carrier” and “carriage service”) 56, 87  & pt 13, https://perma.cc/8FTF-N723.  32 Id. s 275A. 33 Id. s 280. 34 Id. ss 287 & 300. 35 Id. s 285A & pt 13 div 3B. 36 Id. s 303B. 37 Id. ss 311 & 313(3) & (4). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 27 2.  Access to Telecommunications for National Security or Law Enforcement Purposes  The Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) (TIA Act) sets out the rules and procedures that enable government agencies to lawfully intercept or access telecommunications and related data for national security or law enforcement purposes.38 It includes provisions on, for example, warrants authorizing the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO)  to intercept communications;39 emergency requests authorizing officers of a carrier to intercept communications where a person is dying or seriously injured;40 warrants authorizing law enforcement agencies (including at the state level) to intercept communications;41 dealing with intercepted information;42 the preservation of stored communications held by a carrier; access to stored communications pursuant to warrants issued to ASIO and criminal law enforcement agencies; and permitted dealings with accessed information.43   3.  Data Retention Requirements   The TIA Act includes data retention provisions under which telecommunications companies are required to “retain a particular set of telecommunications data for at least 2 years.”44 The required data involves information about communications, such as when an email was sent and the relevant email addresses, rather than the content or substance of communications.45 The Act specifically requires the retention of information regarding “[t]he location of equipment, or a line, used in connection with a communication.”46 Service providers are required to protect the confidentiality of such information by encrypting it and protecting it from unauthorized interference or access.47   Enforcement agencies, including state and territory police, may access telecommunications data for criminal law enforcement purposes and for the enforcement of laws imposing a pecuniary                                                              38 Telecommunications (Interception and Access) Act 1979 (Cth) (TIA Act), https://perma.cc/A6DP-PLQM; Lawful Access to Telecommunications: Telecommunications Interception and Surveillance, Department of Home Affairs, https://perma.cc/AT3F-SQJ8.  39 TIA Act pt 2-2. 40 Id. pt 2-3. 41 Id. pt 2-5. 42 Id. pt 2-6. 43 Id. ch 3. 44 Lawful Access to Telecommunications: Data Retention Obligations, Department of Home Affairs, https://perma.cc/J29H-27BD; TIA Act pt 5-1A. 45 TIA Act s 187AA; Lawful Access to Telecommunications: Data Retention, Department of Home Affairs, https://perma.cc/TT7X-FZM9.  46 TIA Act s 187AA(1) item 6. 47 Id. s 187BA. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 28 penalty.48 Service providers may also voluntarily disclose such data when reasonably necessary for the enforcement of criminal law.49  The OAIC “has a range of powers and obligations in regards to the administration” of both the Telecommunications Act and the TIA Act, including monitoring compliance with the record-keeping requirements related to disclosures of personal information and oversight of the handling of data collected under the data retention provisions.50  4.  Access to Encrypted Information  Following amendments passed in 2018,51 the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and the TIA Act contain provisions that seek to address “law enforcement and intelligence agencies’ challenges with the evolution of the communications environment, including the growth of encrypted communication.”52 These include provisions aimed at enhancing industry cooperation with the relevant agencies and enhancing agency computer access powers to “improve the ability of agencies to operate around encryption without undermining it.”53 This includes provisions related to “technical assistance requests,” “technical assistance notices,” and “technical capability notices.”54  5.  Other Federal and State/Territory Surveillance Laws  Other federal laws relevant to the ability of government agencies to access information held by mobile carriers include the Surveillance Devices Act 2004 (Cth),55 Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth),56 and Crimes Act 1914 (Cth).57 There are also laws at the state and territory level related to the use of surveillance and listening devices, including “tracking” devices. According to one law firm, writing about the possible use of location data or apps in the context of the context of the COVID-19 pandemic,                                                                 48 Id. pt 4-1 div 4 & s 110A. 49 Id. s 177. 50 Telecommunications, OAIC, https://perma.cc/9M4W-ADNS.  51 Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Act 2018 (Cth), https://perma.cc/5QES-5F98.  52 Lawful Access to Telecommunications: Assistance and Access: Overview, Department of Home Affairs, https://perma.cc/G49R-UCX4.  53 Lawful Access to Telecommunications: The Assistance and Access Act 2018, Department of Home Affairs, https://perma.cc/SBN5-HJWR; Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) pt 15. 54 See Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) s 317A. 55 Surveillance Devices Act 2004 (Cth), https://perma.cc/6KPX-C3XD.  56 Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979 (Cth) pt III div 2, https://perma.cc/5YUL-UEBX.  57 Crimes Act 1914 (Cth) pt IAA div 2,  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 29 [i]n general terms, surveillance legislation in NSW, NT, SA and WA prohibits the installation, use or maintenance of a tracking device to determine the geographical location of a person or thing without the express or implied consent of the person. The prohibitions are targeted at individuals and corporations and carry criminal penalties.   Mobile location data, which is collected by mobile carriers, operating systems and apps, would likely not fall within the scope of these prohibitions given the prohibitions are targeted at the installation, use or maintenance of a tracking device without a person’s consent. Mobile phone users would likely have either expressly consented or be considered to have impliedly consented to the use of mobile location services, through use of specific location-based services (in apps or IoT devices) or through use of a mobile network.  Further still, the prohibitions in the relevant instruments are subject to a number of exceptions which vary from state to state and include the installation, use or maintenance in accordance with a law of the Commonwealth. There is scope in a number of Commonwealth Acts for the exercise of various powers to permit the disclosure of mobile location data, including under the Telecommunications Act 1997 (Cth) and the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth). . . .58  6.  Public Health and Disaster Legislation  Legislation related to public health responses to epidemics or pandemics, including the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth),59 the National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth),60 and state and territory public health laws61 and disaster or emergency laws,62 do not appear to contain specific provisions on the use of mobile phone traffic and location data for the purposes of contact tracing or otherwise responding to a pandemic. However, the Biosecurity Act allows the federal health minister to make a determination requiring that various measures be taken by specified classes of persons in order to prevent a listed human disease from entering, emerging, establishing itself, or spreading within Australia.63 Such measures include “requiring a behaviour or practice” and “requiring a specified person to provide a specified report or keep specified records.”64 In addition, the Act provides that “an individual may be required by a human biosecurity control order to wear either or both specified clothing and equipment that is designed to prevent a                                                              58 Michael Caplan et al., Location, Location, Location! – Data, Privacy and Coronavirus, Gilbert + Tobin (Apr. 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/H6EL-C86J.  59 Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth), https://perma.cc/VGT3-NXFW.  60 National Health Security Act 2007 (Cth), https://perma.cc/VB2U-K639.  61 See Links to State and Territory Public Health Legislation, the Biosecurity Act, and the National Health Security Act 2007, Department of Health, https://perma.cc/J2FJ-GHV2.  62 See Helen Portillo-Castro, Emergency Management and Disaster Resilience: A Quick Guide, Australian Parliamentary Library (July 16, 2019), https://perma.cc/G28V-ATTE; Emergency Management, Department of Home Affairs, https://perma.cc/586E-R4YG.  63 Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth) s 51(1).  64 Id. s 51(2). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 30 disease from emerging, establishing itself or spreading.”65 It does not appear that these provisions have been utilized in implementing electronic measures in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.  A “human biosecurity emergency” declaration regarding “human coronavirus with pandemic potential” was made by the government on March 18, 2020.66 The declaration “gives the Minister for Health expansive powers to issue directions and set requirements in order to combat the outbreak” and “is the first time these powers under the Biosecurity Act have been used.”67  Under the National Health Security Act, “the Australian government is authorised to exchange public health surveillance information (including personal information) between the states and territories and the World Health Organisation (WHO). State and territory governments are also responsible for collecting surveillance data to contribute to the national picture and to inform the jurisdictional public health response.”68  III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A.  Use of Anonymized Location Data   According to news reports from early April 2020, Vodafone Australia had provided, on request, “the mobile phone location data of several million Australians in an anonymised and aggregated form to the federal and NSW [New South Wales] governments to monitor whether people are following social distancing restrictions amid the coronavirus pandemic.”69 In addition, “governments, medical experts and the media have used location data from transport apps such as CityMapper, which shows how people move throughout cities like Sydney and Melbourne using public transport, in an attempt to determine whether people’s movement has reduced.”70  One law firm notes that, if sufficiently anonymized, “data about people movements may not qualify as personal information within the meaning of the Privacy Act.”71 However, it further states that “overseas experience shows how readily geo-location data can be reverse processed to re-identify individuals.”72                                                               65 Id. s 88.

Use of Mobile Data in Contact Tracing  According to the news reports, South Australia’s health department had “used an Apple iPhone’s inbuilt location services in a bid to trace the historical movements of a couple diagnosed with coronavirus” in February.74 A spokesperson for the department said that this involved unique circumstances, and that the couple had volunteered their phones to police who worked with the chief public health officer to analyze the data.75  Apart from this instance, it has been reported that no jurisdictions are using an individual’s mobile phone data for contact tracing purposes, with health departments relying mainly on questionnaires in their efforts to locate individuals with whom a person who tested positive for COVID-19 had interacted in the previous 14 days.76   In late March, it was reported that Victoria’s health department was to start using a cloud-based messaging platform, Whispir, to “regularly interact with those who have come into close contact with someone who has contracted COVID-19” and that the platform would “also be used to enforce self-isolation for Victorians who have confirmed cases of the virus.”77 According to Whispir, “[r]ecipients will be required to respond to the communications issued by the DHHS ‘contact tracing’ team by answering a series of questions, including recent activities, health and quarantine status.”78  C.  Australian Government’s Coronavirus Information App   At the end of March 2020, the Australian government released the “Coronavirus Australia” app to provide users with “official information and advice” about the COVID-19 pandemic in Australia.79 It includes a “symptom checker” feature that asks for a person’s gender, age, and confirmation of symptoms. There is also an “isolation registration” option through which a person provides their location, name, phone number, age, gender, number of people in their household, and date their isolation commenced.80 The app reportedly includes a privacy policy                                                              73 Grubb, supra note 69. 74 Id.  75 Id.; Emily Olle, Coronavirus Couple’s Movements to be Tracked by Phone: SA Health, 7News (Feb. 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/UVG3-PNCF.  76 Jessie Davies, Why Australia Isn’t Using Mobile Data to Track People Potentially Infected with Coronavirus, ABC News (Apr. 7, 2020), https://perma.cc/8QVD-9FFU.  77 Justin Hendry, Victoria Ramps Up COVID-19 Contact Tracing Using Whispir, ITNews (Mar. 26, 2020), https://perma.cc/EL83-NMZF.  78 Id.  79 Coronavirus Australia App, Department of Health, https://perma.cc/42GE-SSFD.  80 Katharine Kemp, Opinion: Privacy and Health: COVID-19 Tracking Apps, UNSW Newsroom (Apr. 15, 2020), https://perma.cc/SU7F-AFH2.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 32 related to the isolation registration option, which states that “[t]he Commonwealth Department of Health will share the information with other Commonwealth agencies and the state and territory government agencies as appropriate.”81 Other general Department of Health privacy policies also potentially apply to the app.82  D.  COVIDSafe App  1.  How It Works  a.  Overview  The Department of Health explains that, upon downloading the COVIDSafe app, users provide their name, mobile number, and postcode, and select their age range. The user is sent a confirmation SMS text message to complete the installation of the app. The system “then creates a unique encrypted identifier” for the user.83 The app uses Bluetooth to record a user’s contacts with others who have also installed the app:  COVIDSafe recognises other devices with the COVIDSafe app installed and Bluetooth enabled. When the app recognises another user, it notes the date, time, distance and duration of the contact and the other user’s reference code. The COVIDSafe app does not collect [the user’s] location.84  The information collected by the app is encrypted and “that encrypted identifier is stored securely” on the user’s phoneeven the user cannot access it.85 The information stored on the phone “is deleted on a 21-day rolling cycle.”86  A “frequently asked questions” document further explains that “[w]hen two (or more) app users come into close proximity their phones exchange Bluetooth signals and make a series of ‘digital handshakes’,” and that “[t]he proximity for a close contact is approximately 1.5 metres, for a period of 15 minutes or more.”87 It appears that health officials are able to discern close contacts through technical processes that apply in the storage system: “A filtering process on the highly secure information storage system separates information that meets the close contact requirements and makes it available to the relevant state and territory health officials.”88  When an app user tests positive for COVID-19, state and territory health officials ask them about who they have been in contact with. If the user provides permission, “the encrypted contact                                                              81 Id.  82 Id.  83 COVIDSafe App, Department of Health, https://perma.cc/ZMZ5-WVQJ.  84 Id. 85 Id. 86 Id. 87 Department of Health, Coronavirus Contact App FAQs 3 (Apr. 2020), https://perma.cc/M99X-PRUJ.   88 Id. at 6. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 33 information from the app will be uploaded to a highly secure information storage system.”89 The officials will then  • use the contacts captured by the app to support their usual contact tracing • call people to let them or their parent/guardian know they may have been exposed • offer advice on next steps, including: o what to look out for o when, how and where to get tested o what to do to protect friends and family from exposure  Health officials will not name the person who was infected.90  Users will be prompted to delete the app at the end of the pandemic in Australia, thereby deleting all app information from their phones. In addition, “information contained in the information storage system will also be destroyed at the end of the pandemic.”91  The FAQs document states that “[t]he app cannot be used to enforce quarantine or isolation restrictions or any other laws” and “Commonwealth and state/territory law enforcement agencies will not be allowed to access any information from the app, unless investigating misuse of that information itself.”92   b.  Privacy Policy  The privacy policy for the app, which has been published online, explains what personal information is collected, why it is being collected, how it is collected, how it will be stored, and how it will be used and disclosed, as well as the process for deleting personal information and for a person to access or correct their information; the contact data that the app will record (being “(1) the encrypted user ID, (2) date and time of contact and (3) Bluetooth signal strength of other COVIDSafe users with which you come into contact”); the generation of encrypted user IDs every two hours and the logging of these IDs in the National COVIDSafe data store; the fact that no location data will be collected at any time; access to and automatic deletion of contact data from a user’s phone; and the process if the user tests positive for COVID-19.93  The policy states that, when a user tests positive for COVID-19,  [a] health official will contact you and ask for consent to enter your mobile number into the data store to generate a PIN to be sent to you by SMS.  If you enter the PIN, you will give your consent to upload contact data on your device into the data store to share with health officials to enable contact tracing.                                                               89 COVIDSafe App, supra note 83. 90 Id. 91 Id. 92 Coronavirus Contact App FAQs, supra note 87, at 4. 93 Privacy Policy for COVIDSafe App, Department of Health, https://perma.cc/S836-HYVF.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 34 If another user tests positive to COVID-19, they may upload their contact data, which may include details of their contact with you.94  The policy also states that “[n]o user should feel pressured to install or continue to use COVIDSafe, or to agree to upload contact data to the data store,” and explains that complaints can be made to the Department of Health, OAIC, or the Australian Human Right Commission if a person feels pressured to do these things.95  Registration information, encrypted user IDs, and contact data is stored in a cloud-based facility, “using infrastructure located in Australia.”96 A user can submit a request form for the deletion of personal information held in the data store.  The privacy policy for the app indicates that the Department of Health’s general privacy policy also applies, and that this policy contains information about how a person may complain about a breach of the APPs or an applicable APP code.97 The FAQs document also states that, “[i]n accessing and using the uploaded data, health officials will be required to comply with the Australian Privacy Principles and all applicable data protection and information security obligations. It will only be able to be used for alerting individuals if they have come into contact with a person who has contracted coronavirus.”98  The OAIC “will have independent oversight of personal information handling by the app and the National COVIDSafe Data Store,” and can audit the system and investigate complaints.99   2.  Privacy Impact Assessment  During the development of the app, the Department of Health engaged a law firm to prepare a Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to advise the Department on how it needed to address and mitigate any identified privacy risks.100 Such PIA are required under the Australian Government Agencies Privacy Code for projects “involving new ways of handling personal information.”101 The PIA identifies the potential impacts of the app on individuals’ privacy and sets out 19 recommendations for how these can be managed, minimized, or eliminated. The PIA, along with the Department’s response to the recommendations, were published online at the time the app was released.102                                                               94 Id. 95 Id.  96 Id. 97 Id.

The PIA makes a range of recommendations to ensure privacy issues continue to be addressed as the App is rolled out and App information is collected and used.”103 The PIA recommended, for example, that the Department of Health  • “consider making the source code for the App publicly available”; •  “continue to consider and investigate the legislative options in relation to the collection, use, disclosure, and deletion, of personal information in connection with the App”; • “ensure that the App seeks consent from Users at two different pointsan initial notice which is provided to individuals before they agree to their Registration Information being uploaded to the National COVIDSafe Data Store, and a further notice which is provided before they agree to upload the Digital Handshake information on their device to the National COVIDSafe Data Store”; • “consider developing training and/or scripts for Public Health Officials and Contact Tracers in connection with the App”; • “has contractual or other administrative arrangements in place with the State and Territory public health authorities responsible for contact tracing”; • “seek independent assurance from security experts (including as appropriate, the Australian Signals Directorate and the Australian Cybersecurity Centre), to provide additional testing and assurance that the security arrangements for the App and the National COVIDSafe Data Store, and the use of information in it, are appropriate”; and • “further consider the processes in the App if a User is a Child User.”104  The Department’s response to the PIA agreed with all of the recommendations and set out the actions being taken to address them.105 The OAIC stated that it would monitor the implementation of the recommendations and closely review the relevant legislation.106 The Australian Human Rights Commission also stated it would assess whether additional human rights safeguards should be included in the legislation.107                                                                 103 Maddocks, Department of Health: The COVIDSafe Application – Privacy Impact Assessment ¶ 1.5 (Apr. 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/YXP9-Q8JG.  104 Id. at 5-13. 105 Department of Health, The COVIDSafe Application: Privacy Impact Assessment – Agency Response (2020), https://perma.cc/8H5N-UAZH.  106 Privacy Protections in COVIDSafe Contact Tracing App, supra note 99.  107 Commission Welcomes COVIDSafe App, Australian Human Rights Commission (Apr. 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/6ADV-QGGK.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 36 3.  Interim Determination  Upon launching the COVIDSafe app in late April, the federal Minister for Health made a determination under the Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth)108 that set out rules about the collection and disclosure of data collected via the app and prohibited the coercion of individuals to download or use the app.109 The government explained that this was an interim measure and that legislation was being developed that would govern the app and resulting data. The Attorney-General’s Department explained that the provisions in the determination  • ensure that data from COVIDSafe is only used to support state and territory health authorities’ contact tracing efforts, and only to the extent required to do so • outline limited additional circumstances when data from COVIDSafe can be used, including to investigate a breach of the determination and allow the administrator of the National COVIDSafe Data Store to produce de-identified statistics about COVIDSafe registrations • require that users must consent before data from their device can be uploaded to the National COVIDSafe Data Store • prevent data from COVIDSafe being retained outside of Australia, and protect against unauthorised disclosure outside of Australia • require all COVIDSafe data held in the National COVIDSafe Data Store to be deleted at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic • protect against decryption of COVIDSafe data stored on users’ devices • provide that no one can be forced to download or use COVIDSafe or upload their data to the National COVIDSafe Data Store.110  4.  Legislation  On May 4, 2020, the Australian government released a draft bill related to the COVIDSafe app:111 the Privacy Amendment (Public Health Contact Information) Bill 2020.112 The final version of the legislation was introduced in the Parliament on May 12, 2020, and passed on May 14, 2020.113 The Bill “substantially reproduces the obligations and prohibitions contained in the COVIDSafe Determination, with some amendments to strengthen potential gaps in protection.”114 The Bill                                                              108 Biosecurity Act 2015 (Cth) s 477(1). 109 Biosecurity (Human Biosecurity Emergency) (Human Coronavirus with Pandemic Potential) (Emergency Requirements—Public Health Contact Information) Determination 2020, https://perma.cc/H2TM-MHEF.  110 COVIDSafe Draft Legislation, Attorney-General’s Department, https://perma.cc/YMM6-GDG7. 111 Press Release, Attorney-General, Legislation for COVIDSafe App Privacy Protections (May 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/66AQ-TBTR.

The Attorney-General’s Department summarized the key additional protections in the Bill as follows:  • The national privacy regulator, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner (OAIC), will have oversight of COVIDSafe. They can manage complaints about mishandling of COVIDSafe data and conduct assessments relating to maintenance and handling of that data. • The Privacy Act’s Notifiable Data Breaches scheme will be extended to apply to COVIDSafe data. • The interaction between the powers and obligations of the OAIC in relation to COVIDSafe data with the powers of state and territory privacy regulators and the Australian Federal Police will be clarified. • The administrator of the National COVIDSafe Data Store will delete users’ registration data upon request. • An individual will be required to delete COVIDSafe data if they receive it in error. • No data can be collected from users who have chosen to delete COVIDSafe. • A process will be put in place for COVIDSafe data to be deleted at the end of the COVID-19 pandemic and users to be notified accordingly.115  The Bill added a new part to the Privacy Act, part VIIIA.116 A provision in the Bill “expressly cancels the effect of any Australian law which would otherwise permit or require conduct, or an omission to act, that is prohibited under” the new part.117 According to information provided by the government to the Senate committee tasked with overseeing the response to COVID-19, the legislation “overrides all other Commonwealth and state and territory laws that would provide for any form of law enforcement access.”118  The Bill contains various offenses, including collecting, using, or disclosing app data outside of the circumstances permitted by the Bill; “retaining uploaded COVID app data which has been uploaded to the COVIDSafe Data Store on a database outside Australia, or disclosing such data to another person outside Australia (other than for contact tracing purposes)”; “uploading, or causing to be uploaded, COVID app data from a communication device to the COVIDSafe Data Store without the consent of the COVIDSafe user . . .”; decrypting app data that is stored on a communication device; and coercive actions in respect of the app, including, for example, requiring a person to download or use the app or upload data from the app.119 Each offense “carries a maximum penalty of five years imprisonment and/or 300 penalty units ($63,000 [about US$40,780]). This is the same as the maximum penalty applicable under the Biosecurity Act for breaches of the COVIDSafe Determination.”120                                                                 115 COVIDSafe Draft Legislation, supra note 110. 116 Privacy Amendment (Public Health Contact Information) Act 2020 (Cth), https://perma.cc/UN3V-B5M5.  117 Petrie, supra note 114, at 4. 118 Quoted in id. at 5. 119 Id. at 7. 120 Id. at 8. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 38 Under the Notifiable Data Breaches scheme,   the data store administrator or relevant health authority is required to notify the [OAIC] where they have reasonable grounds to believe they have breached a requirement in relation to COVID app data. The [OAIC] will determine whether the administrator/health authority is required to comply with the data breach notification requirements by preparing a statement about the data breach and notifying affected individuals of (or otherwise publicising) the contents of this statement.121   The OAIC also has the power to conduct assessments of whether state and territory authorities are complying with the part, and to conduct investigations (either in response to a complaint or on its own initiative) into interferences with individuals’ privacy.122  The Bill introduced in the Parliament included reporting requirements that had not been contained in the original draft. These include a requirement that the Minister for Health “cause a report to be prepared on the operation and effectiveness of COVIDSafe and the National COVIDSafe Data Store” every six months, and to present the report to the Parliament.123 The OAIC must also prepare reports on the performance of its functions, and exercise of its powers, under the new part.124 The explanatory memorandum for the Bill states that the reporting obligations are “designed to ensure an appropriate degree of transparency and to build public confidence in the strong privacy protections that will apply under the Bill.”125  The Minister for Health must determine a particular day to be the end of the COVIDSafe data period. The Minister must first consult the Chief Medical Officer or AHPPC and must be satisfied that by that day “the use of the app is no longer required to prevent or control, or no longer likely to be effective in preventing or controlling, COVID-19 in Australia.”126 At the end of the period, no further app data may be collected and the app must not be available for download. The data store administrator must also delete all app data from the data store, inform the Minister for Health and OAIC that it has been deleted, and take all reasonable steps to inform current users of this fact. The Bill provides for the repeal of all provisions inserted into the Act at the end of 90 days after the date specified as being the end of the data period.127  5.  Concerns Raised   Privacy advocates and legal experts have raised various concerns about the privacy protections provided by the app itself, by the interim determination, and by the draft and final bill. These include, for example, potential conflicts with other apps, the possibility of Bluetooth tracking                                                              121 Id.  122 Id. at 9. 123 Id. 124 Id.  125 Attorney-General, Explanatory Memorandum: Privacy Amendment (Public Health Contact Information) Bill 2020, at 7, https://perma.cc/DMJ6-E2C5.  126 Petrie, supra note 114, at 10. 127 Id.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Australia The Law Library of Congress 39 location on other apps, vulnerabilities to data interception, failure to clearly limit data collection and decryption to information about “close contacts,” failure to include decrypted records in the definition of COVID app data in the legislation, and loopholes in the rules against coercing individuals to download and use the app.128  However, many appear to believe that the COVIDSafe Bill passed in May “does go a long way to protecting the use and disclosure of information collected by the app.”129 The opposition party in Parliament agreed, stating that “[i]n many ways the privacy protections included in this bill are to use the word of our timesunprecedented in Australian law.”130 According to the deputy chief medical officer, “all states and territories have now signed up to allow their health officials to use the data.”131 He stated that “[w]e are now absolutely certain privacy and data security issues are all taken care of in terms of states and territories agreeing to our proposals.”132  One of the remaining major concerns raised by critics is whether United States law enforcement entities could gain access to the app data.133 This is because the data is being hosted in Australia by Amazon Web Services, a US company subject to the Clarifying Lawful Overseas Use of Data Act (CLOUD Act)“a law which can force US companies to hand over data to US law enforcement regardless of where that data is held.”134 The government has argued that the Bill makes it an offense to transfer any of the data to any country outside Australia. However, critics have noted that the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (International Production Orders) Bill 2020,135 currently before Parliament, which was developed with the CLOUD Act in mind, “make[s] it possible for Australia to facilitate agreements with other nations so that Australian law enforcement agencies could access data held in those countries and vice versa.”136 For example, the Law Council raised concerns about the adequacy of safeguards in the                                                              128 See James Jin Kang & Paul Haskell-Dowland, How Safe is COVIDSafe?

We hope this continues.  The app will be an essential tool for containing any further outbreaks.  The key is to have as many people registered with the app so in the event of an outbreak, public health officials can find cases faster and rapidly contain it. This will be increasingly important as restrictions are eased around the country and people are more mobile.141                                                                 137 Id. 138 Kelly Burke, Coronavirus Testing: Australia’s COVIDSafe App Still an Untried Tool, 7News (May 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/YE6X-ANBQ.  139 Josh Taylor, NSW is Unable to Use Covidsafe App’s Data for Contact Tracing, Guardian (May 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/6BC9-QQGK.  140 Press Release, Department of Health, Operation of the COVIDSafe App (May 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/8FBY-TL78.  141 Id.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 41 China Laney Zhang Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY In China, the national legislature is considering a comprehensive personal information protection law. Currently, the Cybersecurity Law, which went into effect in 2017, sets out general data protection requirements for network operators. The nonbinding national guidelines for personal data protection provide detailed data protection rules. China’s civil and criminal laws, as well as laws and regulations relating to specific sectors, also contain provisions on privacy and data protection.     The data protection law generally requires consent from the data subjects to collect, store, process, disclose, and use their personal data. The personal data protection guidelines provide additional protection for sensitive personal data, which is defined to include location records and health records. For the purposes of prevention and control of the pandemic, however, authorized parties may collect personal data without the consent of data subjects.     The health code apps reportedly rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user, COVID-19 databases set up by government authorities, and data held by other sources, including the public transportation, telecommunication, and banking sectors. In response to data privacy concerns, the national health code guidelines, issued in April 2020, specify the requirements for the collection, processing, and use of personal health information.    The itinerary card app tracks places users have visited over the past 14 days and has the function of contact tracing using Bluetooth. This app asks for consent from the user to access travel history, but claims not to collect the national ID number, home address, or any other personal data of the user.   I. Introduction  As of May 22, 2020, the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (PRC or China) had reported 82,971 COVID-19 cases, with 82 active cases.1 China has been gradually easing COVID-19 restrictions as the cases decline, although there is still fear about the resurgence of the epidemic.2                                                    1 National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China, Updated COVID-19 Pandemic Information as of 24:00, May 21, https://perma.cc/N6FD-MJJ6 (in Chinese). 2 Coronavirus: Wuhan in First Virus Cluster since End of Lockdown, BBC (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/A8TC-S3FM.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 42 Regulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: China According to the market and consumer data provider Statista, China is the world’s largest smartphone market, with the number of smartphone users projected to reach about 780 million by 2020. As of September 2019, mobile phone subscriptions had reached about 1.6 billion.3  Leakage of personal data has become a widespread problem in the country. In a survey done by a Chinese newspaper in 2019, 95% of respondents said their personal data had been stolen and almost 80% were concerned that their facial recognition data could be leaked from apps.4 A legal framework to strength the protection of personal data is being built, although there is still no significant protection of individual’s data privacy against government intrusion, a study comparing China’s approach on data privacy law with that of the US and EU finds.5  II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionChina has not adopted comprehensive legislation focusing on the regulation of privacy and data protection. The National People’s Congress Standing Committee (NPCSC) has announced that a Personal Information Protection Law is on the national legislature’s 2020 legislative agenda.6 Currently, data protection requirements are found in a series of laws and regulations, outlined below.   1. Legislative Decision, Cybersecurity Law, and National GuidelinesThe 2012 NPCSC Decision on Strengthening Network Information Protection provides high-level national rules relating to the protection of personal data in electronic form. The decision requires internet service providers and other enterprises and public institutions to (1) clearly indicate the purposes, methods, and scope of collection and use of citizens’ personal electronic data, abiding by the principles of “legality, legitimacy, and necessity”; (2) obtain consent from the persons whose personal electronic data is collected; and (3) make public their rules for collection and use of personal electronic data.7  The PRC Cybersecurity Law, which was promulgated in 2016 and went into effect in 2017, sets out general rules of data protection requirements for network operators.

The Personal Data Protection Guidelines, however, are recommended guidelines that lack the force of law.11   2.  Civil Law, Criminal Law, and Sector-Specific Laws  The PRC General Rules of Civil Law prescribe the rights that natural persons are entitled to, including the right to privacy and the right to have their personal data legally protected.12 Any organization or individual that needs to obtain the personal data of others must obtain such information pursuant to the law and ensure information security, and may neither illegally collect, use, process, or transmit the personal data of others, nor illegally trade, provide, or disclose the personal data of others.13 The new PRC Civil Code, which is expected to be passed in this year’s NPC annual session which opened on May 22, 2020, contains a chapter on privacy and personal data protection.14   Under the PRC Criminal Law, an individual may be sentenced to imprisonment for up to seven years, if the circumstances are especially serious, for: (1) illegally selling or providing to others personal data; or (2) stealing or otherwise illegally obtaining personal data.15    Requirements to collect, analyze, store, and share personal data can also be found in various laws and regulations relating to specific sectors such as the banking, insurance, medical, credit                                                  8 PRC Cybersecurity Law (adopted by the NPCSC on Nov. 7, 2016, effective June 1, 2017) art. 76, https://perma.cc/3HAP-D6MZ (in Chinese). 9 Id. art. 28. 10 Id. art. 45.  11 State Administration for Market Regulation & Standardization Administration of China, PRC National Guidelines, Information Security Technology—Personal Information Security Specification, GB/T 35273—2020 (Mar. 6, effective Oct. 1, 2020) (Personal Data Protection Guidelines), https://perma.cc/9XQ4-72GA (in Chinese). 12 PRC General Rules on the Civil Law (adopted by the National People’s Congress on Mar. 15, 2017, effective Oct. 1, 2017) art. 110, https://perma.cc/AY65-LA2N.  13 Id. art. 111. 14 China Focus: China Moves Closer to Civil Code, Xinhuanet (May 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/4TSX-XCHQ.  15 Ninth Amendments to the PRC Criminal Law (adopted by the NPCSC on Aug. 29, 2015, effective Nov. 1, 2019) art. 253a, https://perma.cc/U4QB-YKN4 (in Chinese). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: China The Law Library of Congress 44 information, and telecommunications sectors. The new E-commerce Law passed in 2018 contains strong data protection requirements applicable to e-commerce operators.16  B. Data Retention and Location Tracking  1.  Requirements under Cybersecurity Law and National Guidelines   The data protection laws generally require consent from data subjects to collect, store, process, disclose, and use their personal data. The Cybersecurity Law provides that network operators may only collect, store, process, disclose, and use personal data if individuals are notified of the purpose, manner, and scope of such activities, and have consented to it. According to the Law, network operators must not collect personal data that are irrelevant to the services they provide and must dispose of the personal data they have stored in accordance with applicable laws, administrative regulations, and agreements with the user.17   The Cybersecurity Law does not distinguish between personal data and sensitive personal data. The definition of “sensitive personal data” and its additional protection are found in the Personal Data Protection Guidelines. The Guidelines define sensitive personal data as personal data the leakage, illegal provision, or abuse of which may endanger the safety of life and property; easily damage the personal reputation or physical and mental health of a person; or easily cause discriminatory treatment.18 Identity card numbers, personal biometric information, bank account numbers, communication records and content, property information, credit information, location records ( 行踪轨迹), accommodation information, health and physiological information, transaction information, and the personal data of children at or under the age of 14 are sensitive personal data under the Guidelines.19  The Guidelines provide additional protection for processing sensitive personal data. The explicit consent of the data subject must be obtained when collecting sensitive personal data.20 Security measures such as encryption must be implemented in transmitting and storing sensitive personal data.21   2.  Criminal Punishments  Illegally selling or providing to others location tracking data is criminally punishable under the PRC Criminal Law. The Law itself does not specify the scope of the personal data to be protected. In 2017, the Supreme People’s Court (the highest court) and the Supreme People’s Procuratorate (the prosecutor) jointly released a judicial interpretation on the infringement of personal data in                                                  16 Laney Zhang, China: E-Commerce Law Passed, Global Legal Monitor (Law Library of Congress, Nov. 21, 2018), https://perma.cc/BJ9F-UQMN.  17 PRC Cybersecurity Law art. 41. 18 Personal Data Protection Guidelines § 3.2. 19 Id. 20 Id. § 5.4. 21 Id. § 6.3. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: China The Law Library of Congress 45 criminal cases. The interpretation defines the scope of personal data: name, ID number, correspondence and telecommunications contact information, resident address, account name and password, property ownership, and whereabouts and tracking data (行踪信息).22  3.  Data Collection under Health Laws  The PRC Law of Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (Infectious Diseases Law) obliges all entities and individuals in China to “provide truthful information about diseases” to disease control agencies and medical institutions. 23 The Law further requires disease control agencies to collect, analyze, investigate, and verify information of the epidemic, and report to relevant governments.24   III. Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A.   Circular on Personal Data Protection and Big Data   China has deployed digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, big data, cloud computing, blockchain, and 5G, in fighting the COVID-19 spread, and these technologies “have effectively improved the efficiency of the country’s efforts in epidemic monitoring, virus tracking, prevention, control and treatment, and resource allocation,” according to an article authored by an official of the Cyberspace Administration of China.25   In response to public concerns about numerous data leakage incidents that happened around the country during the outbreak of COVID-19, on February 4, 2020, the Cyberspace Administration of China released a circular on protecting personal data in fighting the pandemic.26  1.  Exception to the Requirement of Consent   The Circular states that those parties authorized by the health department of the State Council pursuant to the Cybersecurity Law, Law of Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases, and Regulation on Responses to Public Health Emergencies may collect personal data for the purposes of prevention and control of the epidemic. Unless otherwise provided by relevant laws                                                  22 Supreme People’s Court & Supreme People’s Procuratorate, Judicial Interpretation on Several Issues Concerning the Application of Law in the Handling of Criminal Cases Involving Infringement of Citizens’ Personal Information (May 8, 2017, effective June 1, 2017), https://perma.cc/S9SF-44J7 (in Chinese); Laney Zhang, China: Judicial Interpretation on Infringement of Personal Information Released, Global Legal Monitor (Law Library of Congress, Sept. 1, 2017), https://perma.cc/V3Q7-TH92.  23 PRC Law of Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases (adopted by the NPCSC on Feb. 21, 1989, amended June 29, 2013) art. 12, https://perma.cc/287T-JNGP (in Chinese). 24 Id. art. 33.  25 Qi Xiaoxia, How Next-Generation Information Technologies Tackled COVID-19 in China, World Economic Forum (Apr. 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/TU48-DG2K.  26 Cyberspace Administration of China, Circular on Ensuring Effective Personal Information Protection and Utilization of Big Data to Support Joint Efforts for Epidemic Prevention and Control (Feb. 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/6WUS-ZLQV (in Chinese).   \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: China The Law Library of Congress 46 and administrative regulations, unauthorized parties may not collect data for pandemic prevention and control purposes without the consent of the data subjects.27   2.  Requirements for Data Collection  The Circular provides that the collection of personal data must refer to the Personal Data Protection Guidelines. Subjects whose personal data may be collected are limited to a key group comprised of confirmed carriers, suspected carriers, and close contacts.28 Personal data collected for preventing or treating epidemic diseases cannot be used for any other purpose and cannot be made public without the consent of the data subjects unless public disclosure is necessary for the prevention of the epidemic and the information is first redacted or anonymized.29 The Circular also requires entities that collect and possess personal data to have strict data security measures in place to prevent data breaches.30  The Circular encourages capable enterprises to utilize big data to support the control and prevention of the pandemic and monitor the movement of confirmed carriers, suspected carriers, and close contacts.31  B.  Health Code Apps  Since February 2020, Chinese provinces and municipalities have started to introduce their own color-based health code systems to control people’s movements and curb the spread of the coronavirus. There is also a national health code system. The health code systems are largely operated as mini apps embedded in the popular social media app WeChat and the payment app Alipay. The mini apps automatically generate and assign quick response codes (QR codes) to citizens as an indicator of their health status. Most systems use three colors: users with a green code can move freely, users with a yellow code have to go into government quarantine or self-quarantine for up to seven days, and users with a red code will be quarantined for 14 days. 32   The health code apps reportedly rely on a combination of self-reporting by the user, COVID-19 databases set up by government authorities, and data held by other sources including the public transportation, telecommunication, and banking sectors. Typically, the user is required to report his or her name, gender, cellphone number, national ID number, home address, and travel history; indicate whether he or she has been in contact with someone diagnosed with COVID-19; and complete a health survey. The apps also have access to data held by the public transportation systems, including the civil aviation, railroad, highway, electronic toll collection, and city bus                                                  27 Id. art. 1.  28 Id. art. 2. 29 Id. art. 3. 30 Id. art. 4.  31 Id. art. 5.  32 Where Are Health Codes Going in the Future?, The Paper (Apr. 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/68C3-XXTW (in Chinese); Nectar Gan & David Culver, China Is Fighting the Coronavirus with a Digital QR Code.

The apps may serve as a tracker for people’s movements in public areas, as users have their codes scanned as they enter public places.34  Privacy experts have warned about the leakage and abuse of personal data associated with the health code apps and have urged Chinese authorities to make sure the health code apps meet data privacy principles.35 On April 29, 2020, the State Administration for Market Regulation and Standardization Administration of China released a series of national guidelines for personal health information codes, which specify requirements for the collection, processing, and use of personal health information and aim to help the provinces acknowledge health codes from each other and facilitate travel.36   Under the guidelines, the collection, processing, and use of personal health information must comply with the Personal Data Protection Guidelines. Health codes must be encrypted and stored using an algorithm satisfying the requirements for national password management. Personal health information services and apps must obtain the express consent or authorized consent of users when collecting data, and must keep the private content confidential. The guidelines, however, are recommended guidelines that lack the force of law.37  C. Itinerary Card App  Another COVID-19 app, the “communication big data-based itinerary card,” was launched by China’s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology with the aim of helping users “easily prove your itinerary, improve the efficiency of itinerary inspection of enterprises, communities, transportation departments and other agencies, and speed up the process of work resumption.”38   The itinerary card app does not require self-reporting by users, but asks for consent from users to access their travel history. It tracks places users have visited over the past 14 days, including                                                  33 Id.  34 Gan & Culver, supra note 32. 35 Id.; Expert Warns Against Health Code Data Leakage and Abuse, Xinhuanet (Mar. 18, 2020), https://perma.cc/WAT5-NBG7 (in Chinese). 36 National Guidelines for Personal Health Information Codes Released and Implemented, China Electronics Standardization Institute (Apr. 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/GZ2J-2974 (in Chinese).  37 Frequently Asked Questions on Personal National Guidelines for Personal Health Information Codes, China Electronics Standardization Institute (May 7, 2020), https://perma.cc/7SCE-CSB3 (in Chinese).  38 How Can I Prove that I Have Not Been to Any Epidemic-Stricken Region or Country in the Past 14 Days?

A user will receive a risk alert when any other user who has been in close contact with him or her is diagnosed positive.41                                                    39 Id. 40 Id. 41 Communication Big Data Travel Card User Guide, China Academy of Information and Communications Technology, https://perma.cc/9ZYK-AWXF (in Chinese). \fThe Law Library of Congress 49 India Tariq Ahmad Foreign Law Specialist    SUMMARY The Supreme Court of India has held that the right to privacy is a fundamental right protected under article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of India’s Constitution. India currently does not have a comprehensive Privacy Bill, though one is being developed, but specific provisions to protect electronic data can be found in the Information Act, 2000, and its subsidiary privacy rules. No central law lays out data retention provisions for government agencies and departments but various agencies have adopted their own data retention policies.    Both the Union and state governments have launched numerous COVID-19-related apps over the last two months to curtail the spread of the disease in the country. The most prevalently used app is the Union government’s official COVID-19 tracking app, Aarogya Setu (“bridge to health”), which was launched in April for Android and iOS users. The app was developed by the National Informatics Centre of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology as a contact tracing app. It uses both Bluetooth and GPS location data technology and allows users to assess the risk of their catching the coronavirus infection based on their interactions with others.   I. Introduction  According to the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare website, as of May 22, 2019, India had 66,330 active cases of COVID-19, 48,533 cured/discharged COVID-19 patients, and 3,583 deaths from the disease.1  There are an estimated 450 million smartphone users and 550 million feature phone users in India.2 According to a 2019 KPMG report, the smartphone user base is forecast to be 829 million by 2022, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 15.5%.3 According to Statista, “[i]t was predicted that by 2022, 36 percent of mobile phone users in the country would use a smartphone, up from 26 percent in 2018.”4  Most surveys on users’ willingness to share personal data appear to be focused on the private sector. One recent survey by Accenture found that “[n]early six in ten consumers would be willing to share significant personal information, such as location data and lifestyle information,                                                  1 COVID-19 India, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, https://perma.cc/QVT3-7ZBQ.  2 Himanshi Lohchab, Overall India Handset Market Growth to Fall in 2020, The Economic Times (Dec. 24, 2019), https://perma.cc/9ERD-UJRD.  3 KPMG, Fintech in India – Powering Mobile Payments 6-8 (Aug. 2019), https://perma.cc/VKC2-KPG3.. 4 Share of Mobile Phone Users that Use a Smartphone in India from 2014 to 2022, Statista (Oct. 24, 2019), https://perma.cc/942Z-XUUS.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 50 with their bank and insurer in exchange for lower pricing on products and services.”5 However, “consumers believe that privacy is paramount, with three quarters (75 percent) saying they are very cautious about the privacy of their personal data. In fact, data security breaches were the second-biggest concern for consumers, behind only increasing costs, when asked what would make them leave their bank or insurer.”6 One 2018 survey by the Analytics India Magazine found that “50.6% of the respondents said they trust banks most with their personal datamore than the government, e-commerce companies, social media websites or online media companies,” and “[o]verall, 33% respondents said they trust government departments with their data. 27% are neutral and 40% of respondents admitted that they do not trust them with their data.”7  II. Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   On August 24, 2017, the Supreme Court of India, in Justice K.S. Puttaswamy (Retd.) v. Union of India,8 held that privacy is a fundamental right protected by article 21 (right to life and personal liberty) of India’s Constitution.9   Currently, the Information Technology Act, 2000,10 “contains specific provisions intended to protect electronic data (including non-electronic records or information that have been, are currently or are intended to be processed electronically).”11 India’s Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (IT) adopted the Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules (Privacy Rules),12 which took effect in 2011 and “require corporate entities collecting, processing and storing personal information, including sensitive personal information, to comply with certain procedures.”13 The rules contain “specific provisions regarding the collection of sensitive personal data or information. They apply to all body corporates in India other than those providing services related to the processing of sensitive personal data or information to any person under a contract.”14                                                   5 Six in Ten Consumers Willing to Share Significant Personal Data with Banks and Insurers in Exchange for Lower Pricing, Accenture Study Finds, Accenture (Mar. 14, 2019), https://perma.cc/AJ6D-W9FQ.  6 Id.  7 Smita Sinha, Annual Consumer Survey on Data Privacy in India 2018, Analytics India Magazine (May 25, 2018), https://perma.cc/E2K5-44HD.  8 K.S.

Data Retention and Location Tracking  1.  Data Retention  There is no central law for government agencies and departments in India that lays out data retention provisions, but various agencies have adopted their own data retention policies.   For the private sector, Rule 5(4) of the Privacy Rules states that a “[b]ody corporate or any person on its behalf holding sensitive personal data or information shall not retain that information for longer than is required for the purposes for which the information may lawfully be used or is otherwise required under any other law for the time being in force.”21 Record and document preservation provisions are also set out in various laws and mostly vary from 5-8 years or permanent preservation.22  2.  Location Tracking  The 2000 Information Technology Act allows the central government to authorize any agency of the government to monitor and collect data generated, transmitted, received, or stored in any computer source for the purpose of enhancing cyber security and for “identification, analysis and                                                  15 Personal Data Protection Bill, No. 373 of 2019, https://perma.cc/S9PF-CSSN.  16 The Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, PRS Legislative Research, https://perma.cc/Y6H5-J3T7.  17 Personal Data Protection Bill, No. 373 of 2019, § 2(A).  18 Id. § 2(B). 19 Id. § 91(2).  20 Talwar Thakore & Associates, supra note 14.  21 Information Technology (Reasonable Security Practices and Procedures and Sensitive Personal Data or Information) Rules (Privacy Rules), 2011, Rule 5(4).  22 Period of Preservation of Accounts/Records under Different Laws, Bombay Chartered Accountants Society, https://perma.cc/RCV6-STMD.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 52 prevention of intrusion or spread of computer contaminant in the country.”23 Procedures and safeguards for monitoring and collecting traffic data under this provision are regulated by the Information Technology Act and the Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguard for Monitoring and Collecting Traffic Data or Information) Rules, 2009.24 These Rules stipulate   who may issue directions for interception and monitoring; how such directions are to be executed; the duration they remain in operation; to whom data may be disclosed; the confidentiality obligations of intermediaries; periodic oversight of interception directions by a Review Committee under the Telegraph Act; the retention of records of interception by intermediaries; and the mandatory destruction of information in appropriate cases.25  III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  Both the Union and state governments have launched “a host of coronavirus-related apps over the last few weeks to curb the spread of the pandemic in the country.”26  A. Aarogya Setu Contact Tracing App  1.  How It Works  The official COVID-19 tracking app of the Union government, Aarogya Setu (“Bridge to Health”), was launched in April for Android and iOS users. The app was developed by the National Informatics Centre, which comes under the Ministry of Electronics and IT.27 The app has reportedly been installed 114 million times with 50 million installs in 13 days and 100 million in 41 days.28 There does not appear to be any particular legal framework that governs the app apart from a privacy policy and terms of service29 that have been updated a number of times.30  Some aspects of its usefor example, mandatory use in certain circumstanceshave been included in orders issued under the Disaster Management Act, 2005,31 which allows the union government                                                  23 Information Technology Act, 2000, § 69B. 24 Information Technology (Procedure and Safeguard for Monitoring and Collecting Traffic Data or Information) Rules, 2009,  The Gazette of India Extraordinary, pt.

The information that is collected from the User’s App will be securely stored on the mobile device of the other registered user and will not be accessible by such other user. In the event such other registered user tests positive for COVID-19, this information will be securely uploaded from his/her mobile device and stored on the Server. Then this information is used to further carry out the contact tracing and find out all possible persons who may have come in close contact with the person who has tested positive for COVID-19.34  The app tries to “determine if the user has been within six-feet of an infected person, by cross-referencing” the pan-India database (referred to as the “Server” in the above quote) of all COVID-19 patients.35 The app also allows the Department of Health to “inform users of the app regarding risks, best practices and relevant advisories pertaining to the containment of COVID-19.”36   2.  Data Collected  When the Aarogya Setu app is registered by a user, the following details are collected: “(i) name; (ii) phone number; (iii) age; (iv) sex; (v) profession; and (vi) countries visited in the last 30 days.”37 This information is stored on the “back-end Server and it is hashed with a unique digital id (DiD)” that is pushed to the user’s app. The DiD is used to identify the user in all subsequent app-related transactions and will be associated with any data or information uploaded from the app to the database. The user’s location details are also captured and uploaded to the database.38  The app collects location data continuously at 15-minute intervals, which is stored on the mobile device and includes a record of all the places the user has been” at those intervals. This information is uploaded to the database along with the user’s DiD,                                                    32 Vidisha Singh, India’s Aarogya Setu Contact Tracing App – Compromising Privacy in a Pandemic?, Jurist (May 18, 2020), https://perma.cc/2A4X-VKRR.  33 Press Release, Ministry of Electronics & IT, Government of India Launches ArogyaSetu App to Track Covid 19 Infection (Apr. 2, 2020), https://perma.cc/GW6E-56NK.  34 Government of Assam, Frequently Asked Questions on Aarogya Setu App, Q3, https://perma.cc/AN8L-2HBA. 35 Shubhang Gopal, Aarogya Setu: 9 Things You Must Know before Downloading the Contact Tracing App, The Indian Express (May 10, 2020), https://perma.cc/7X79-WA5T.  36 Arogya Setu – Govt. of India Initiative to Fight against Corona Virus – Bluetooth Based COVID-19 Tracker Mobile Application, District Court, https://perma.cc/DK4J-LQRU.  37 Government of Assam, supra note 34, Q2. 38 Id.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 54 (i) if the person tests positive for COVID-19; and/or  (ii) if the persons self-declared symptoms indicate that they are likely to be infected with COVID-19; and/or (iii) if the results of a self-assessment test are either yellow or orange. This information will not be uploaded to the Server if you are not unwell or if the result of your self-assessment test is green.39  Yellow or orange signifies “a high level of risk for contracting COVID-19.”40  3.  Persons Required to Download the App  When the app was launched in early April its use was considered voluntary but became mandatory for persons in certain containment zones and for public and private sector employees in May.   On May 1 the Union Home Secretary issued new guidelines41 under section 10(2)(I) of the Disaster Management Act, 2005,42 that designated districts into Red, Orange, and Green Zones based on risk. Green Zones are those that had no cases as of the date of the guidelines or within the previous 21 days; Red Zones were designated based on the “total number of active cases, doubling rate of confirmed cases, extent of testing and surveillance feedback.”43 Orange zones are those that do not fit the criteria for the Green or Red designations.   Within the Red and Orange Zones authorities may set up Containment Zones or areas for more intense surveillance, such as contact tracing, home or institutional quarantining, and house-to-house surveillance by special teams. According to the guidelines, “[t]he local authority shall ensure 100% coverage of [the] Aarogya Setu app among the residents of Containment Zones.” The guidelines also required all employees in the public and private sector to use the Aarogya Setu app, with the head of each organizations being responsible for ensuring use by all employees. However, after criticisms from privacy advocates, it appears the government is easing its position on mandatory use of the app in offices: On May 17, the Ministry of Home Affairs issued new guidelines that stated, “[w]ith a view to ensur[ing] safety in offices and work places, employers on [a] best effort basis should ensure that the application is installed by all employees having compatible mobile phones.”44 The new guidelines also stipulate that “[d]istrict authorities may advise individuals to install the Aarogya Setu application on compatible mobile phones and regularly update their health status on the app. This will facilitate timely provision of medical                                                  39 Id.

The revised guidelines issued by the Union Health ministry for home isolation of very mild/pre-symptomatic cases also call for downloading the app on the mobile and made it clear it should remain active at all times (through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi).”49 Since the new federal guidelines removing the mandatory requirement were issued some states such as Uttar Pradesh have still made the use of the app mandatory and are imposing a fine for not doing so.50  In addition, some private companies such as Zomato and Xiaomi have made it mandatory for employees to download the app.  According to guidelines for international arrivals, “[a]ll passengers shall be advised to download Arogya Setu app on their mobile devices.” Those who for “exceptional and compelling reasons such as cases of human distress, pregnancy, death in [the] family, serious illness and parent(s) accompanied by children below 10 years, as assessed by the receiving states,” cannot carry out an institutional quarantine are permitted to home quarantine for 14 days but are required to use the Aarogya Setu app.51 Union guidelines for domestic travel, including air and train, also advise passengers to download the Arogya Setu app on their mobile devices.52 On May 25 domestic flights had resumed operations and the use of the app was made mandatory. According to  a news report “[a]ll passengers, except children below 14 years, must be registered on the Aarogya                                                  45 Id.  46 Government of India, Ministry of Home Affairs, MHA Order No. 40-3/2020-DM-I(A), (May 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/2TX9-W7UL.  47 Andrew Clarance, Aarogya Setu: Why India’s Covid-19 Contact Tracing App Is Controversial, BBC News (Delhi) (May 15, 2020), https://perma.cc/K5TY-4TYZ. 48 Neerad Pandharipande, ‘Indian Govt Should Convince Public on Aarogya Setup’s Efficacy rather than Forcing It on Them’: Cybersecurity Expert Elliot Alderson Tells Firstpost, Firstpost (May 23, 2020), https://perma.cc/A6S2-MRZ9. 49 Covid-19 Contact Tracing App Aarogya Setu Has Alerted 1.4 Lakh Users: Official, LiveMint (May 12, 2020), https://perma.cc/AQ2S-QT6M.   50 Government Climbs Down on Aarogya Setu by Removing Mandatory Provision, LiveMint (May 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/F7UH-GVVZ.  51 Government of India Ministry of Health and Family Welfare Guidelines for International Arrivals (May 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/HWV6-GL8L.  52 Government of India Ministry of Health and Family WelfareGuidelines for Domestic Travel (Air/Train/Inter-state Bus Travel) (May 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/CVD9-BGNL.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 56 Setu app and it will be verified at the entry gate of the terminal building.”53 Another news report noted that “passengers ‘not showing Green’ on Aarogya Setu app will not be allowed to enter into the airports.”54 The Aarogya Setu app was also made mandatory for train passengers in the country.55  4.  Government Use   According to the government, the personal information collected upon registration will   only be used by the Government of India in anonymized, aggregated datasets for the purpose of generating reports, heat maps and other statistical visualisations for the purpose of the management of COVID-19 in the country or to provide you general notifications pertaining to COVID-19 as may be required. Your DiD will only be co-related with your personal information in order to communicate to you the probability that you have been infected with COVID-19 and/or to provide persons carrying out medical and administrative interventions necessary in relation to COVID-19, the information they might need about you in order to be able to do their job.56  In the event a person has tested positive for COVID-19, the information collected is used to map the places the person has visited over the past 14 days “in order to identify the locations that need to be sanitised and where people need to be more deeply tested and identify emerging areas where infection outbreaks are likely to occur.”57 In late May the privacy policy and terms of service were updated so that “location data for the last 30, not 14, days will now be pinged to the server if a user comes in close proximity of an infected person.”58 Other data retention requirements are as follows:  All traced personal information shared between users, risk assessment tests and location information will be retained on the mobile device for a period of 30 days from the date of collection. All personal information uploaded to the Server will, to the extent that such information relates to people who have not tested positive for COVID-19, will be purged from the Server 45 days after being uploaded. Persons who have tested positive for COVID-19 will be purged from the Server 60 days after such persons have been declared cured of COVID-19.59  There is an exception for “anonymized/ aggregated datasets” generated by the “personal data of registered users of the App or any reports, heat maps or other visualization created using such                                                  53 Text Bulletin Details: Morning News, All India Radio (May 25, 2020), https://perma.cc/LZ23-PFVE.  54 Prabhakar Thakur, Aarogya Setu App Mandatory for Airline Passengers, No Entry Without ‘Green’ Status, NDTV’s Gadgets360 (May 21, 2020), https://perma.cc/HV5M-D84K.  55 Id.  56 Government of Assam, supra note 34, Q5. 57 Id.

Privacy Concerns  As per the head of this project, Arnab Kumar, the app was built to the standards of the draft data privacy bill, which is currently in the country’s parliament, and “access to the data it collects is strictly controlled.”61 Such data “is encrypted using state-of-the-art technology and stays secure on the phone till it is needed for facilitating medical intervention.”62   However, when the app was first introduced and even now, political leaders, experts and human rights organizations have expressed several criticisms and highlighted a number of privacy concerns.  Rahul Gandhi, a prominent MP and former leader of the opposition Indian National Congress is reportedly among those who are critical of the app, arguing that it has “no institutional oversight” and raises “serious data security and privacy concerns.”63   In a blog post on Medium on May 6, French ethical hacker Robert Baptiste, who goes by the name Elliot Alderson, observed a number of security concerns and flaws with the app, including that it was “possible to modify the location of the app, which can enable one to identify how many people are unwell or infected even without being physically present in their vicinity.”64 However, he stated that in a subsequent version of the app, “this issue was ‘fixed silently’ by the developers.”65 In mid-May, a software engineer in the city of Bangalore, growing concerned that installing the app was slowly becoming mandatory in India, hacked the app so it was “collecting no data but still flashing a green badge declaring that the user was at low risk of infection.”66  Experts have noted that India is currently the only democratic nation in the world that had made the coronavirus tracking app mandatory for a significant portion of its population.67 Some observers have also criticized the app on the ground that it “stores both location data and requires constant access to the phone’s Bluetooth,” which makes it “invasive from a security and privacy viewpoint.”68 Until recently, Aarogya Setu was not open source, so the app was also criticized because it could not be “audited for security flaws by independent coders and researchers.”                                                  60 Id.  61 Aarogya Setu: Lack of Data Privacy Laws, Transparent Policies Make App Worrisome, Say MIT Researchers, First Post (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/E3S5-TUQE.  62 Id.   63 Id.   64 Pandharipande, supra note 48.  65 Id.  66 Pranav Dixit, India’s Contact Tracing App Is All But Mandatory.

Experts also noted that the app used “a static ID and is more easily amenable to de-anonymisation i.e. identifying the owner, in case someone else gets hold of the DID, because there is only a single layer of encryption.”69 On May 7, the MIT Technology Review highlighted a number of similar concerns including the absence of a national data protection law. 70 This has raised the concern that the use of the app and its data collection has an “ambiguous legal basis.”71     Though MIT researchers had given the app 2 out 5 stars in their review, they later downgraded the rating to one star, according to The Quint. “[T]he app lost more points on the parameters of ‘data minimisation’ which means the app is collecting more data than needed for the app to work,” the article said, citing a Times of India report.72 One recent report highlights certain examples of this “non- adherence to the principle of data minimization”:   • The personal information collected includes detail of the individual’s profession[,]  which has no direct relation with the effective use of the App   • Proximity data should be used (as opposed to location tracking)73  Concern has also been expressed over the lack of definition of collected “anonymised data” and conflicting reports over how long such data can be retained.74 There is also concern that health surveillance, which is “a necessity in a pandemic,” “can soon evolve into mass surveillance.”75  On May 26 the Ministry of Electronics and IT announced that the software has been made open source. “The source code for the Android version of the application is available for review and collaboration,” the Ministry said, and an “iOS version of the application will be released as open source within the next two weeks and the server code will be released subsequently. Almost 98% of Aarogya Setu Users are on Android platform.”76                                                     69 Anuj Srivas, Aarogya Setu: Six Questions for the Centre on the COVID-19 Contact Tracing App, The Wire (May 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/JDD2-QYEA.  70 O’Neill, supra note 67. 71 Tripti Dhar, supra note 59.  72 MIT Researchers Downgrade Aarogya Setu App to One Star in Review, The Quint (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/EF6B-HFCA.  73 Tripti Dhar, supra note 59. 74 Id.  75 Anand Venkatanarayanan, Op-ed, Covid-19: How the Aarogya Setu App Handles Your Data, BloombergQuint (Apr. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/Q5DN-URWE.  76 Press Release, Ministry of Electronics & IT, Aarogya Setu Is Now Open Source (May 26, 2020), https://perma.cc/CCD6-GDWZ.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 59 6.  Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol  On May 11, 2020, in response to the many privacy concerns, the Ministry of Electronics and IT published through a notification the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol.77 The Protocol was issued by the chairperson of the “empowered group on technology and data management,” “which is one of the 11 empowered groups created by the National Executive Committee of the National Disaster Management Authority”78 to “provide legal safeguards for the operation of the Aarogya Setu mobile application.”79 Some of the key highlights of the protocol include the following:  1. Data points collected from the individuals: ‘Response data’ collected from people using the Aarogya Setu app will have the following data points- 1.1 Demographic data, which includes the name, mobile number, age, gender, profession and travel history of the person; 1.2 Contact data i.e. data about another person that a given person has come in close proximity with, including the duration of the contact, the proximate distance between the individuals and the geographical location at which the contact occurred; 1.3 Self-assessment data i.e. the responses provided by the person to the self-assessment test on the Aarogya Setu app, and 1.4 Location data i.e. data about the geographical position of an individual in latitude and longitude. 2. Implementing agency: MeitY will be responsible for overall implementation of the protocol. The National Informatics Centre (“NIC”) under the MeitY will collect, process and manage ‘response data’. 3. Application of collection limitation, purpose limitation and period limitation principles: The Protocol requires that- (a) the response data to be collected and its purpose must be specified in the privacy policy of the Aarogya Setu app; (b) the data must be used in a ‘necessary and proportionate’ manner only for the purpose of framing appropriate health responses and to improve such responses; (c) the contact data, location data and self-assessment data will not be retained beyond a period of 180 days, unless extended by the EG; (d) demographic data will be stored till the Protocol is in force i.e. 180 days, unless extended by the EG; in case a person requests her data to be deleted, then it must be deleted within 30 days of her request. 4. Third party sharing of response data: 4.1 Sharing of personal response data: It can be shared with- (a) the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare; (b) Health departments of the state/union territory/local government, NDMA and state disaster management authorities (“SDMAs”), and any other department/ministry/public health institution of the central/state/local                                                  77 Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020, https://perma.cc/WPH6-S6CY.  78 Ikigai Law, A Summary of the Aarogya Setu Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/MLH8-XPLD#acceptLicense.  79 Vidhi Centre for Legal Policy, Aarogya Setu’s Data Access and Knowledge Sharing Protocol, 2020 (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/V4J7-9G5X.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 60 government, but only if the data is necessary to frame/implement an appropriate health response. 4.2 Sharing of de-identified response data: It can be shared with the ministry/department/public health institution of the central/state/union territory/local government, NDMA and SDMAs, where the data needs to be shared for framing/implementation of a critical health response. De-identified data means data which has been stripped of personally identifiable data. 4.3 Maintaining records of third parties: NIC will, to a reasonable extent, maintain a list of agencies with whom response data is shared, and record details such as the purpose of sharing, categories of data shared etc. 4.4 Application of collection limitation, purpose limitation and period limitation principles: These principles will also apply to third-party sharing of response data. The data must be permanently deleted in all circumstances after 180 days from the date on which it is accessed. Any ministry/department/public health institution with whom the data is shared must implement reasonable security practices and procedures under the Information Technology Act, 2000. 4.5 Further sharing of response data: Any ministry/department/public health institution shall further share response data only when it is strictly necessary to frame/implement appropriate health responses. It must ensure compliance of the Protocol by other such entities with whom data is further shared. Such entities can be subject to an audit and review of their usage of response data by the central government. 5. Sharing of response data for research purposes: 5.1 Availability of response data to Indian universities and research institutions: Such universities and research institutions must be registered in India. The response data provided to them must be subject to ‘hard anonymisation’ (as opposed to de-identification). The anonymisation protocols for ‘hard anonymisation’ will be developed by an expert committee appointed by the Principal Scientific Advisor of the Indian government. 5.2 Data access subject to approval of expert committee: An institution will need to submit a request to the PSA-appointed expert committee to seek access to response data. The expert committee can approve such request only if it is satisfied that the access is sought for the purposes of statistical, epidemiological, scientific or any other form of academic research. It can also specify additional terms for accessing the data. 5.3 Reverse anonymisation/re-identification banned: If the institution, irrespective of its intention, conducts reverse anonymisation or re-identification of the response data, its access rights will be terminated. It will also be subject to penalties under the applicable laws. 5.4 Further sharing of response data: Institutions can share the anonymised response data with any other institution, provided that- (a) the sharing is for the purpose approved by the expert committee; (b) there is a contract between both parties, mentioning particulars such as nature of data shared, purpose of sharing data, the duration of such sharing and other details specified by the expert committee. The institution must provide a copy of the contract to the expert committee. 6. Penalties: Any violation of the protocol will be punishable under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 and any other applicable legal provisions. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 61 7. Termination of protocol: The Protocol will be in force for 6 months i.e. till 11 November 2020. However, its enforcement period may be extended upon a review by the EG.80  The Protocol has still come under criticism by privacy groups for not being legally binding; lacking a complaint mechanism for violations of the protocol; not providing a process by which to request deletion of data; not going far enough with the privacy safeguards, particularly in regard to the anonymization of data and data sharing with third parties; and including a sunset clause for the protocol but not for the app itself.81   The privacy policy and terms of service have been updated to address some of these concerns including updates as of late May by which the government may now be held liable for “unauthorised access to your information or modification thereof” and removal of the ban on reverse engineering of the app.82  7.  Judicial Response   On May 12, the Kerala High Court “refused to pass an interim order to stay the mandatory downloading of ‘Arogya Setu’ app on employees’ phones and sought a statement from the central government on data safeguards of the app being developed by the National Informatics Centre,” the Hindustan Times reported.83  B.  State-Level Apps   According to one news report several states and municipalities in India have developed their own COVID-19 contact tracing, home quarantine, and information advisory apps over the past two months, with most of these having been developed by private companies “that have unprecedented access to sensitive patient data with little liability in case of a breach.”84 The Indian Express highlighted a number of privacy concerns for these apps:  “Most of these apps have been developed by private companies and they have access to all the data while the liability provisions in case of breach are very vaguely worded, sometimes even asking the user to completely wave the liability and accountability of the service provider in case of data breach or loss,” Salman Waris, founder & partner at TechLegis Advocates & Solicitors said.  . . .                                                    80 Ikigai Law, supra note 78. 81 Vakasha Sachdev, Does Govt’s New Data Protocol Address Concerns over Aarogya Setu?, The Quint (May 13, 2020), https://perma.cc/KM2E-R8BR.  82 Aditi Agrawal, supra note 30.  83 Kerala High Court Refuses Stay on Mandatory Use of Arogya Setu App, Hindustan Times (May 12, 2020), https://perma.cc/XBE9-2AS8.  84 Aashish Aryan, Coronavirus Tracking Apps: States on Launching Spree; Privacy Concerns over Unfettered Access Raised, The Indian Express (May 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/6VNA-U236.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: India The Law Library of Congress 62 The permissions sought by the most of these contact tracing apps and home quarantine portals is another security issue which must be paid attention to, cyber-security experts said. “Excessive permissions are required by applications that undertake tracing and surveillance through capturing information from different internal broadcasts from components of the device. In some cases, apps which are only informative and intended to issue advisories have sought permissions for location, photos, storage and camera,” a SFLC spokesperson said.  For example, Telangana’s app ‘T-Covid-19’ developed by Quantela Inc, a US-based company, aims only to “provide citizens with preventive care information and other government advisories”. “However, for an information and advisory serving app, it asks for several permissions which include monitoring components including ‘extra location provider commands’ which pertains to state of location,” legal cyber-security advisory group Software Freedom Law Centre said.  A similar COVID-19 dashboard, developed by the Madhya Pradesh Agency for Promotion of Information Technology was taken down after Robert Baptiste, a French ethical hacker who used the pseudonym Elliot Alderson on Twitter, pointed out flaws and showed that it violated the basic personal privacy laws. The quarantine and information vending apps of Punjab and Kerala, similarly seek more information than is necessary for these programs to function, experts said.  Punjab’s information vending app ‘Cova Punjab’ seeks to have full network access and even view network connections. The app even seeks to pair with Bluetooth devices in its vicinity without express approval of the device holder, which can be extremely problematic and invasive, a cyber-law expert said. “The problem is that all the state apps are using Centre’s Aarogya Setu framework and foundation as the starting point. That will not be a correct approach,” Supreme Court lawyer and cyber-law expert Pavan Duggal told The Indian Express.85  In Uttar Pradesh, the “Chikitsa Setu” app was launched to “ensure safety of COVID-19 frontline workers,” with the objective “to provide official training content, spread awareness, and ensure safety of healthcare workers, sanitation workers and police personnel who are actively involved to protect citizens, breaking the chain of COVID-19 infection.”86                                                  85 Id.  86 UP CM Yogi Adityanath Launches ‘Chikitsa Setu’ App to Ensure Safety of Frontline Workers, eHealth Network (May 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/UDJ5-9QVW.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 63 Japan Sayuri Umeda Senior Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY Privacy and private information are protected in Japan, including a person’s location information. The location of a person who communicates via a mobile device is treated as information relating to the secrecy of communication that the Constitution of Japan protects. Telecommunications carriers can collect such information only when a user has consented, when a judge has issued a warrant, or when there is a legally justifiable cause. Law enforcement cannot track a suspect by secretly attaching a GPS device to the suspect’s belongings without a warrant issued by a judge. When the government conducts an epidemiological investigation, a health center official tracks the past locations of the person. If the person refuses to cooperate with the investigation, the investigation cannot be conducted. The government, in cooperation with information technology organizations, has tried to utilize an infection route tracking application software on mobile devices. The government expects to launch the system in June 2020.  I. IntroductionAs of May 22, 2020, according to the Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW), the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 16,513 in Japan, a rate of 131 per million. The number of deaths is 796.1 It is “among the lowest death rates in the world.”2  Most people have smartphones in Japan. As of 2018, 95.7% of households owned mobile information and communication devices, according to a survey by the Ministry of Internal Affairs and Communications (MIC). Among them, the percentage of smartphones was 79.2%.3 A more recent survey by a private institution found that the percentage of smartphones among mobile phones reached 88.9% in January 2020.

According to an international study, the Japanese were the least willing overall to share information with organizations online among people in the studied countries.5 II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionThere is a no legal provision that explicitly protects the right to privacy, however, the right to privacy has been recognized by the courts.6 Courts and scholars have found the legal basis of the right to privacy in the right to the pursuit of happiness that is guaranteed under the Constitution.7 Regarding personal information and privacy, in 2003, the Supreme Court decided that even basic information about a person, such as names, addresses, and telephone numbers, can be protected as private, depending on the circumstances. In that case, a university had disclosed such information about applicants for attendance at a foreign leader’s lecture to the police, without their prior consent. The Court decided the disclosure constituted a tort.8   There are three laws regulating the handling of personal information. The Act on the Protection of Personal Information (APPI) applies to the private sector. 9 The Act on the Protection of Personal Information Held by Administrative Organs (APPIHAO) applies to government agencies. 10 The Act on the Protection of Personal Information Held by Independent Administrative Agencies, etc., (APPIHIAA) applies to independent administrative agencies.11 These laws aim to protect personal information while they set rules to properly utilize personal information for the development of relevant industries.12 These laws define personal information as follows: 5 KPMG, Crossing the Line: Staying on the Right Side of Consumer Privacy 23 (2016), https://perma.cc/5MHN-7GW2. 6 Hiromitsu Naito, モデル小説における表現の自由とプライバシーの権利[Freedom of Expression and Right to Privacy on Novels Based on Real Person], 専修法学論集 [107 Specialized Law Stud.

Data Retention and Location Tracking  1.  APPI, APPIHAO, and APPIHIAA  When the location information of a person can enable a third party to identify that person, the APPI, APPIHAO, and APPIHIAA treat it as personal information. If location information is anonymized, the information can be transferred and utilized under certain conditions.16   2.  Guidelines for Telecommunications Carriers  The Constitution states that the secrecy of any means of communication must not be violated.17 The Telecommunications Business Act also states that “[t]he secrecy of communications handled by a telecommunications carrier must not be violated.” 18  Because the telecommunications business deals with this right to protection of the secrecy of communications, the handling of personal information by telecommunications carriers requires special consideration. The MIC has issued the Guidelines for Personal Information Protection in Telecommunications Business that                                                      13 APPI art. 2, para. 1 & 2; APPIHAO art. 2, para. 2 & 3; APPIHIAA art. 2, para. 2 & 3. 14 Taro Komukai, ICT 技術と位置情報に関する制度の動向 [Development of System for ICT Technology and Location Information], 日本データ通信[Nippon Data Comm.

MIC updates the Guidelines every few years.19   The Guidelines state that telecommunications carriers may collect personal information relating to the right to secrecy of communication only when the subject person has agreed or when there is justifiable cause for noncompliance with the law. 20  The location information of mobile telecommunication device users is private information. Among other things, information about a device user’s terminal base or wifi access point is information that relates to the secrecy of communications.21 The Guidelines state that telecommunications carriers can collect the location information of mobile communication devices when it is necessary for the telecommunications carrier’s business or when there is justifiable cause for noncompliance with the regulation.22 A telecommunications carrier can provide a third party with the location information of a holder of a mobile communication device in the following cases: The customer has consented to it in advance, a judge issued a warrant for it, or there are other justifiable causes for noncompliance with the law.23  In addition, telecommunication carriers can provide a third party with the location information of a telecommunication device without customers’ consent when the life or body of the holder of the device is likely in danger.24   3.  Criminal Investigation  Law enforcement used Global Positioning System (GPS) devices to investigate suspects. The police believed tracking suspects with a GPS device during a criminal investigation could be allowed as a non-compulsory measure.25 However, the Supreme Court decided in 2017 that the police need a warrant issued by a judge to secretly track the location of a suspect’s car.26 The Court said it is a method of investigation that allows the police to encroach upon an individual’s private sphere against the person’s reasonably inferred desire, enabling an invasion of privacy.27                                                       19 電気通信事業における個人情報保護に関するガイドライン [Guidelines for Personal Information Protection in Telecommunications Business], MIC, https://perma.cc/E2D4-3MFM.  20 電気通信事業における個人情報保護に関するガイドライン [Guidelines for Personal Information Protection in Telecommunications Business], MIC Notification No. 152 (Apr. 18, 2017), amended by MIC Notification No. 297 (Sept. 14, 2017), art. 7, para. 3, https://perma.cc/Q9J5-ZZ84.  21 緊急時等における位置情報の取扱いに関する検討会, 位置情報プライバシーレポート [Report on Privacy and Location Information 6-9] MIC (July 2014)], https://perma.cc/GTR4-39JT.  22 Id. art. 35, para. 1. 23 Id. art. 35, para. 2. 24 Id. art. 35, para. 5. 25 Code of Criminal Procedure, Act No. 131 of 1948, amended by Act No. 63 of 2019 (Reiwa), art. 197, https://perma.cc/L3S7-AM76 (unofficial translation as amended by Act No. 74 of 2011). 26 2016 (A) 442, Keishu 71-3 (S.

Infectious Disease Prevention Act  Under the Infectious Disease Prevention Act, when a prefectural governor deems it necessary to prevent or monitor the outbreak of an infectious disease or investigate the cause of outbreaks, the governor may direct prefecture officials to question the patients, suspected disease carriers or asymptomatic carriers of certain diseases and to carry out necessary investigations.28 When the Minister of MHLW deems it urgently necessary for the purpose of preventing the outbreak or spread of an infectious disease, the Minister may direct relevant officials of the MHLW to do the same.29 Under these provisions, local health centers conduct an epidemiological investigation. Health centers ask patients where they visited, among other things. 30 However, there is no provision in the Act to force the patients to answer the questions. In a recent news article, it was reported that those people who refused to answer questions made the investigation of transmission routes difficult.31       III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A.  Infection Route Tracking Application Software  The government has formed the Anti-COVID-19 TECH Team (ACTT), which examines the utilization of information technology and various data to counter COVID-19 and adopt IT measures while receiving assistance from IT companies. ACTT had its first meeting on April 6, 2020. 32  The government decided on April 7, 2020, to develop an infection route tracking application software, modeled on TraceTogether in Singapore, as a measure against the spread of COVID-19 infections.33 On May 8, 2020, the government decided to move jurisdiction over the                                                      28 感染症の予防及び感染症の患者に対する医療に関する法律 [Act on the Prevention of Infectious Diseases and Medical Care for Patients with Infectious Diseases](Infectious Disease Prevention Act), Act No. 114 of 1998, amended by Act No. 115 of 2014, art. 15, para. 1, https://perma.cc/H2HA-BGEW (unofficial translation).  29 Id. art. 15, para. 2. 30 国立感染症研究所 感染症疫学センター [Infectious Diseases Surveillance Center, National Institute of Infectious Diseases], 新型コロナウイルス感染症患者に対する積極的疫学調査実施要領 [Guidelines for Active Epidemiological Surveys on New Coronavirus Infections 1] (Apr. 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/MH3V-6WMS.  31 「調査の電話に出てくれない」感染拡大の若年層、追跡拒否のケースも [‘They do not answer phone calls’: Infection Expanded Among Young, Some Refuse Tracking of Transmission Routes], Yomiuri (Apr. 5, 2020), https://www.yomiuri.co.jp/medical/20200405-OYT1T50044/.  32 新型コロナウイルス感染症の拡大防止対策に資するIT 活用について [Regarding Utilization of IT that Contributes to Measures Against Spread of Novel Corona Virus Disease Material No. 1 for ACTT Kick-off Meeting] (Apr. 6, 2020), Gov’t Chief Info.

The application, when installed in a device, will store the identifiers of other devices that have the application installed when these devices come within a certain distance for a certain duration of time, using Bluetooth. Identifiers are not connected to the individuals who have the devices, and they change periodically. Stored identifiers are deleted after a certain period.  • When a health care provider tests one of the device holders and the person is confirmed to be infected with COVID-19, the provider will notify a local health center. The health center inputs the information in the COVID-19 management system operated by the MHLW. The health center notifies the infected person of the result of the test.  • The notified person inputs the information that he or she received the positive test result from the health center on the application on his/her device. The application sends other device holders who have come in close contact with the person a warning. Persons who received the warning input the information on the application on their devices. The application program sends the information to the health center.   To protect privacy of the users, the software will not keep track their geolocation data. The system will not notify when and where they were in close proximity or the identity of the infected person.35   The government planned to operate the system in early May, but it was delayed until June. According to a news article, the agreement with Apple and Google has not been completed yet.36                                                           34 接触確認アプリ、所管を厚労省に アップル・グーグルの方針受け [Contact Tracing App, Jurisdiction to MHLW, Due to Policy by Apple and Google], Nikkei (May 8, 2020), https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXMZO58875030Y0A 500C2EA3000/.

South Korea also has data protection laws, including a law specifically to protect location data. However, after the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome outbreak in South Korea in 2015, surveillance was strengthened, and the Infectious Disease Prevention and Control Act has a provision that overrides the location information law. People must cooperate with epidemiological investigations. Persons who are required to self-quarantine are monitored, and violators can face criminal punishment. The movements of infected or quarantined people are monitored by the use of credit cards, the location information of smartphones and, in some cases, electronic wristbands.    I. Introduction/OverviewAccording to the website of the Ministry of Health and Welfare (MOHW), confirmed cases of COVID-19 totaled 11,142 as of May 22, 2020. The number of deaths was 264.1 Smartphone ownership in South Korea is high. About 95% of South Koreans own a smartphone—the highest nationwide level of smartphone ownership in the world.2 Older people have switched to smartphones in recent years. In 2019, about 80% of people in their 60s had smartphones.3  II. Legal FrameworkA.

Among them, the Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA)7 is the comprehensive general data protection law. PIPA states the general principles for handling personal information. For example, a personal information controller must specify explicitly the purposes for processing personal information and collect personal information lawfully and fairly to the minimum extent necessary for such purposes. A personal information controller must not use it beyond those purposes. A personal information controller must manage personal information safely. A 2020 amendment that will become effective in August 2020 states further that, if it is still possible to fulfill the purposes of collecting personal information by processing anonymized or “pseudonymised” personal information, the personal information controller shall endeavor to do so.8      There are also sector-specific laws for protection of personal information, such as the Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection,9 as well as the Credit Information Use and Protection Act.10   B. Data Retention and Location Tracking  The Location Information Act defines “personal location information” as information about a place where a particular person exists or has existed at a certain time, which is collected using telecommunications equipment facilities. It includes information readily combinable with other information to track the location of a particular person even though location information alone is not sufficient to identify the location of the person.11   The Location Information Act prohibits the collection, use, or provision of location information regarding an individual or mobile object without the consent of the individual or the owner of the mobile object. In a case of an emergency rescue or as otherwise provided by other laws, such consent is not required.12 The Act also requires that when a person lends an object with devices                                                      6 Act on the Protection, Use, etc. of Location Information (Location Information Act), Act No. 7372, Jan. 27, 2005, amended by Act No. 16087, Dec. 24, 2018, art. 1, https://perma.cc/7ZCG-VSW2 (unofficial translation as amended by Act No. 14224, May 29, 2016). 7 Personal Information Protection Act (PIPA), Act No. 10465, Mar. 29, 2011, amended by Act No. 16930, Feb. 4, 2020, https://perma.cc/M3EP-UEZ5.  8 Act No. 16930 art. 3 9 Act on Promotion of Information and Communications Network Utilization and Information Protection, etc., Act No. 6360, Jan. 16, 2001, amended by Act No. 16021, Dec. 24, 2018, https://perma.cc/REX2-QVM3.  10 Credit Information Use and Protection Act, Act No. 9617, Apr. 1, 2009, amended by Act No. 15146, Nov. 28, 2017, https://perma.cc/5PUN-94UM.  11 Location Information Act art. 2, subparas. 1 & 2. 12 Id. art. 15, para. 1. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Korea The Law Library of Congress 72 capable of collecting location information, the person must notify the borrower of the fact that the object has a built-in location information collection device.13   Any person who intends to engage in the business of collecting location information and providing such information to service providers must obtain permission from the Korea Communications Commission (KCC).14 Only corporations can obtain permission.15 In addition, any person who intends to engage in the business of providing services based on personal location information must report its trade name, the address of the main office, the type of business, and its location information systems, among other things, to the KCC.16   Before collecting location information, a corporation that has obtained permission for a location information business must specify in its terms and conditions the contact information, rights held by the subjects of personal location information, details of its services to a provider of a service that uses personal location information, and the period of data retention, among other things.17 Any service provider based on location information must do the same before providing service.18 A corporation that has obtained permission for a location information business and a service provider utilizing personal location information can use or provide personal location information if it is processed in such a way that any specific person cannot be identified, and it is provided for the purpose of statistics, academic research, or market research.19  A person who has obtained permission for a location information business and a service provider utilizing personal location information must take managerial and technical measures to prevent the divulging, alteration or impairment of location information in accordance with the government decree.20 The KCC may examine the measures.21  III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  Under the Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act, the Director of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC), governors, and the heads of municipal governments conduct an epidemiological investigation when an infectious disease breaks out and is likely to become predominant. 22  Epidemiological investigation includes identification of the path of                                                      13 Id. art. 15, para. 3. 14 Id. art. 5, para. 1. 15 Id. art. 5, para. 5. 16 Id. art. 9, para. 1. 17 Id. art. 18, para. 1. 18 Id. art. 19, para. 1. 19 Id. art. 21, para. 1. 20 Id. art. 16, para. 1. 21 Id. art. 16, para. 3. 22 Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act, Act No. 9847, Dec. 29, 2009, amended by Act No. 17067, Mar. 4, 2020, art. 18, para. 1, https://perma.cc/9GY9-WNSB (unofficial translation, as amended by Act No. 14286, Dec. 2, 2016). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Korea The Law Library of Congress 73 infection and the source of infection by the disease.23 No one is allowed to refuse, interfere with, or evade the epidemiological investigation without a justifiable reason; to make a false statement; or to intentionally omit any fact.24 Violations are punishable by imprisonment for not more than two years or a fine not exceeding KRW20 million (about US$16,150).25  In addition, in order to prevent the further spread of an infectious disease upon its outbreak, the MOHW or a local government may keep persons suspected of being infected by the pathogen of an infectious disease hospitalized or quarantined in a proper place for a certain period.26 A recent amendment adds a penalty for violations. A violation is punishable by imprisonment for up to one year or a fine not exceeding KRW10 million (about US$8,080).27  South Korea experienced the largest outbreak of the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) virus outside of the Middle East in 2015.28 Following the MERS outbreak, South Korea took measures to strengthen its ability to carry out more accurate epidemiological studies and disease surveillance. The Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act was amended in December 2015.29 Amended article 76-2, paragraph 2, states that, if necessary to prevent infectious diseases and block the spread of infection, the Minister of HOMW and heads of local governments may request law enforcement to provide the location information of patients with an infectious disease and persons likely to be infected by an infectious disease.30 It further states that, in such cases, the head of the relevant police agency may request any location information provider and any telecommunications business operator to provide location information of the person despite restrictions under the Location Information Act,31 as well as restrictions under the Protection of Communications Secrets Act.32 The location information provider and the telecommunications business operator cannot refuse the request except in extenuating circumstances.33 This provision                                                      23 Enforcement Decree of Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act, Presidential Decree No. 22564, Dec. 29, 2010, amended by Presidential Decree No. 30596, Apr. 2, 2020, art. 14, https://perma.cc/G3JE-DSTM (unofficial translation as amended by Presidential Decree No. 29180, Sept. 18, 2018); and Enforcement Rule of Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act, art. 14 & att. 1-3, MOHW Decree No. 32, Dec. 30, 2010, amended by MOHW Decree No. 717, Apr. 3, 2020.  24 Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act art. 18, para. 3. 25 Id. art. 79. 26 Id. art. 47, subpara. 3 27 Id. art. 79-3. 28 2015 MERS Outbreak in Republic of Korea, World Health Org., https://perma.cc/BT7G-9FRD.

The Ministry of Land, Infrastructure and Transport, the Ministry of Science and ICT (Information and Communication Technologies), and the KCDC jointly developed the system. The Korean National Police Agency, the Credit Finance Association, South Korea’s three mobile carriers, and 22 credit card issuers have joined the system.35  Additionally, because the number of cases of people breaching the self-quarantine raised concerns, the government announced the use of electronic wristbands on people who violate self-isolation rules to better contain the spread of COVID-19 on April 11, 2020.36 Although some indicated concern about a breach of privacy, 80.2% of people in a government survey supported the idea of using electronic wristbands to keep track of those under self-quarantine.37 However, the government cannot force people to wear the wristbands because there is no law requiring it. Since April 27, 2020, if a violator agrees, he or she wears a wristband for two weeks.38 Some foreign countries have started importing the wristbands and may follow South Korea’s monitoring method.39    The Infectious Diseases Control and Prevention Act states that citizens should be provided with detailed information, such as the movement paths, transportation means, and medical treatment institutions and contacts of infected persons. 40 The KCDC and metropolitan and provincial governments release a detailed log of the movements of COVID-19 patients, including the time and name of places they visited, through the media and related websites. Out of privacy concerns, the National Human Rights Commission of Korea called on “the authorities to publish the time and names of locations visited by infected people, rather than providing the travel history of each individual, and specify disinfection and protective measures taken by the public health authorities for these locations.”41                                                         34 Jae-hee Choi, South Korea’s Best Method of Tracking COVID-19 Spread: Credit Card Transactions, Korea Herald (Apr. 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/M8P3-6VXH.   35 S.

Both government and nongovernment agencies are required to delete personal data when the specific purpose of data collection no longer exists or the retention period ends.   In response to COVID-19, Taiwan launched the Digital Fence Intelligent Monitoring System, known as the “digital fence,” in February 2020, to monitor the location of those required to undergo home quarantine via their own cellphones or government-issued cellphones, with the goal of preventing their movement and stopping the spread of the infection. Taiwan implemented a mandatory 14-day home quarantine for the contacts of confirmed cases and all overseas arrivals.    The government has acknowledged that cellphone location data is protected by the PDPA. It reportedly argues, however, that it is within the necessary scope of the government’s performance of its statutory duties to subject location data to regulation in the current circumstances; it notes that telecom companies are “furthering the public interest” by participating in the tracking effort and therefore are also exempt from liability. The tracking system will be discontinued after the pandemic passes and all stored personal data will be deleted at that time.   I. Introduction  Taiwan has won global praise for its effective control of the COVID-19 pandemic. As of May 22, 2020, a total of 441 confirmed cases of COVID-19 had been reported in Taiwan, including seven deaths, out of a population of almost 24 million.1   A highly tech-savvy democracy, Taiwan is believed to have implemented the first phone-based tracking system to enforce quarantine in the current pandemic. It began working on the system, described as a “digital fence,” as early as in late January 2020, a week after Taiwan recorded its first imported case of the novel coronavirus from China.2 Although there have been concerns over data privacy, the public opinion in general firmly supports the government in its handling of the pandemic. A telephone poll conducted in mid-February by the Taiwanese Public Opinion                                                  1 CECC Reports No New Confirmed Cases; 408 Patients Released from Isolation, Taiwan Centers for Disease Control (Taiwan CEC) (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/QR83-WPH4; Mary Hui, How Taiwan Is Tracking 55,000 People under Home Quarantine in Real Time, Quartz (Apr. 1, 2020), https://perma.cc/9LAF-C8M4. 2 Yasheng Huang et al., How Digital Contact Tracing Slowed Covid-19 in East Asia, Harvard Bus. Rev. (Apr. 15, 2020), https://perma.cc/HW3C-VJ73.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Taiwan The Law Library of Congress 76 Foundation found that people on average gave the government a score of 84 points out of 100 for its epidemic response.3 In terms of smartphone usage, over 98% of the Taiwanese population owned smartphones as of 2019.4   II.  Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   The primary Taiwanese legislation governing the collection, process, and use of personal data is the Personal Data Protection Act 2015 (PDPA).5 The PDPA provides two sets of data protection rules applying to government agencies and nongovernment agencies, respectively. Government agencies include central and local government and administrative entities that are authorized to exercise public authority. Nongovernment agencies include individuals, legal persons, and other entities that are not government agencies.6  Personal data under the PDPA include names, dates of birth, ID Card numbers, passport numbers, characteristics, fingerprints, marital status, family, education, occupation, medical records, medical treatment, genetic information, sexual life, health examinations, criminal records, contact information, financial situation, social activities, and other information or data that may be used to identify a natural person, directly or indirectly.7   According to the PDPA, the collection, processing, and use of personal data must be carried out in an honest and good-faith manner that respects the data subject’s rights and interests, does not exceed the necessary scope of the specific purposes, and has a legitimate and reasonable connection with the purposes of collection.8   Sensitive data under Taiwanese law may refer to medical records, medical treatment, genetic information, sexual life, health examinations, and criminal records. According to the PDPA, these data may not be collected, processed, or used unless expressly required by law or within an exception specified by the PDPA. One such exception concerns those cases where collection, processing, or use of sensitive data is within the necessary scope for a government agency to perform its statutory duties or for a nongovernment agency to fulfill its statutory obligations, provided that proper security and maintenance measures are adopted prior or subsequent to such collection, processing, or use of personal data.9                                                   3 Hui, supra note 1.  4 Samantha Wong, Smartphone Market in Taiwan – Statistics & Facts, Statista (Apr. 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/UC9J-XFRG.  5 Personal Data Protection Act (promulgated Aug. 11, 1995, amended Dec. 30, 2015), https://perma.cc/WM7B-PNED (in Chinese), https://perma.cc/MTB4-D9LX (English translation).  6 Id. art. 2. 7 Id. 8 Id. art. 5. 9 Id. art. 6. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Taiwan The Law Library of Congress 77 B. Data Retention and Location Tracking  Although location data is not specified by the PDPA as a form of personal data, it may be deemed “other information or data which may be used to identify a natural person,” and therefore subject to the requirements of the PDPA on the collection, processing, and use of personal data.    Under the PDPA, the collection or processing of personal data by a government agency must be for specific purposes and on one of the following bases:  1. where it is within the necessary scope to perform its statutory duties; 2. where consent has been given by the data subject; or 3. where the rights and interests of the data subject will not be infringed upon.10  The collection or processing of personal data by a nongovernment agency must be for specific purposes and expressly required by law, consented to by the data subject, necessary for furthering the public interest, or on others grounds specified by the PDPA.11   Furthermore, a government agency may only use personal data within the necessary scope of its statutory duties and for the specific purpose of collection. The use of personal data for any other purposes must be on the following grounds:  1. where it is expressly required by law; 2. where it is necessary for ensuring national security or furthering public interest; 3. where it is to prevent harm to the life, body, freedom, or property of the data subject; 4. where it is to prevent material harm to the rights and interests of others; 5. where it is necessary for statistics gathering or academic research by a government agency or an academic institution for public interests, provided that such data, as processed by the data provider or as disclosed by the data collector, may not lead to the identification of a specific data subject; 6. where it is for the data subject’s rights and interests; or 7. where consent has been given by the data subject.12  A nongovernment agency may only use personal data within the necessary scope of the specific purpose of collection, or if it is expressly required by law, consented to by the data subject, necessary for furthering public interests, or on other grounds specified by the PDPA.13                                                    10 Id. art. 15. 11 Id. art. 19. 12 Id. art. 16. 13 Id. art. 20. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Taiwan The Law Library of Congress 78 Both government and nongovernment agencies are required by the PDPA to delete personal data, voluntarily or upon the request of the data subject, when the specific purpose of data collection no longer exists or the retention period ends.14  III. Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A.  Digital Fence and Entry Quarantine System  In response to the pandemic, Taiwan implemented a mandatory 14-day home quarantine for contacts of confirmed cases and all overseas arrivals and launched the Digital Fence Intelligent Monitoring System, known as the “digital fence,” in February 2020. The system monitors the location of those required to undergo home quarantine via their own cellphones or government-issued cellphones to prevent their movement and stop the spread of the infection.15   The telecom companies track the quarantined individuals by triangulating the location of their phones relative to nearby cell towers. Venturing too far from homes triggers the alert system, and text messages are sent to the quarantined individuals, government civil affairs and health authorities, and local police to ascertain their whereabouts. The government also contacts those in quarantine on a daily basis to ensure they do not evade tracking by leaving their phones at home. Anyone caught breaching their quarantine can be fined up to NT$1 million (about US$33,000).16   Taiwan has also launched an Entry Quarantine System that seeks to expedite entry of all international arrivals by requiring them to scan a QR code upon entering Taiwan and fill out a health declaration. This system has been integrated with the digital fence system, allowing hospitals, clinics, and pharmacies to gain access to patients’ travel histories.17   B.  Government Response to Data Privacy Concerns  In response to concerns arising from the tracking system over data privacy, the government has reportedly cited the Communicable Disease Control Act and the Special Act for Prevention, Relief and Revitalization Measures for Severe Pneumonia with Novel Pathogens, which authorize the government to impose “necessary measures” in epidemic control. 18  The government has acknowledged that cellphone location data is protected by the PDPA. It argues, however, that it is within the necessary scope of the government’s performance of its statutory duties to subject                                                  14 Id. art. 11. 15 Lawfully Comply with 14-Day Home Quarantine, Protect Health of People, Taiwan CDC (Mar. 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/687T-9QFB (in Chinese). 16 Id.; Hui supra note 1; Huang et al., supra note 2. 17 Huang et al., supra note 2; To Integrate Entry Quarantine System with Digital Fence Intelligent Monitoring System, Tracking Whereabouts through Cellphone Location, Ministry of Health and Welfare (May 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/7TWF-92TF (in Chinese). 18 Pai-ching Hou, Is the Digital Fence that Other Countries Are Striving to Imitate Unconstitutional?

It recommends voluntary apps that comply with data protection and privacy rules and are deleted once they are no longer necessary. Its recommendation sets out detailed rules for the development of such apps and for the use of anonymized mobility data. The eHealth Network, a voluntary network that provides a platform of Member States’ competent authorities dealing with digital health, has published a practical guide for Member States for developing privacy-preserving mobile apps for contact tracing. It is planning on publishing another toolbox for the use of mobility data in June 2020.   The protection of personal data and the respect for private life are fundamental rights in the EU. The data protection legal framework in the EU currently consists of two main pillars, the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePrivacy Directive) and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive set out various requirements for the processing of traffic and location data. In general, consent is required or processing must be necessary for the provision of the service; however, exceptions are possible for reasons of public interest such as public health, or for public security. Derogations must be necessary, appropriate, and proportionate measures. In addition, the EU Decision on Combating Serious Cross-Border Threats to Health, which lays down rules on epidemiological surveillance and on monitoring, early warning, and responsive measures to combat serious cross-border threats to health, allows the transmission of personal data necessary for the purpose of contact tracing.    I. Introduction  On April 17, 2020, the European Commission (Commission) published a “Joint European Roadmap Towards Lifting COVID-19 Containment Measures” that sets out recommendations for the EU Member States to reopen their economies.1 The three criteria used to assess whether measures taken can be relaxed are epidemiological criteria, sufficient health system capacity, and appropriate monitoring capacity.2 With regard to monitoring, the Commission suggests, among other things, creating a “framework for contact tracing and warning with the use of mobile apps, which respects data privacy.”3 For that purpose, it has adopted a recommendation to develop a common European approach (“toolbox”) for the use of mobile applications and has published                                                  1 Joint European Roadmap Towards Lifting COVID-19 Containment Measures, 2020 O.J.

Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionThe protection of personal data and the respect for private life are fundamental rights in the EU.11 Personal data is defined as “any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (data subject).”12 Among other things, location data is one of the factors that can make a person identifiable.13 The data protection legal framework in the EU currently consists of two main pillars, the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePrivacy Directive)14 and the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).15 The ePrivacy Directive is slated to be replaced by an ePrivacy Regulation; however, the legislative process is still ongoing, with the last action taken in November 2019, and there appears to be no consensus among the EU countries.16 1. General Data Protection RegulationAs a regulation, the GDPR is directly applicable in the EU Member States with generally no domestic implementing legislation needed.17 Processing of personal data18 according to the GDPR must comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness, and transparency; purpose limitation; data minimization; accuracy and keeping data up to date; storage limitation; and 11 Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union (EU Charter) arts. 7, 8, 2012 O.J.

Some provisions nonetheless require for their implementation the adoption of measures of application by the Member States—for example, the appointment of a national regulator and administrative sanctions for a violation of the GDPR. The GDPR also contains “opening clauses” that permit diverging national legislation in certain areas—for example, for the processing of special categories of personal data or in the context of employment. 18 “Processing” means “any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.” GDPR, art. 4, point (2). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 83 integrity and confidentiality.19 Article 6 of the GDPR sets out the conditions under which data processing is considered lawful, with the most common ground being consent given by the data subject.20   The processing of certain special categories of personal data (sensitive data), such as data concerning health, is generally prohibited.21 However, as an exception, sensitive data may be processed if it is “necessary for reasons of public interest in the area of public health, such as protecting against serious cross-border threats to health . . . , on the basis of Union or Member State law which provides for suitable and specific measures to safeguard the rights and freedoms of the data subject.”22 Recital 52 of the GDPR clarifies that derogations from the general prohibition are possible for reasons of “health security, monitoring and alert purposes, the prevention or control of communicable diseases and other serious threats to health.” Furthermore, processing is allowed when it is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject.23 The GDPR explains that this exception may be used as a basis to monitor epidemics and their spread.24  Pseudonymization means the “processing of personal data in such a manner that the personal data can no longer be attributed to a specific data subject without the use of additional information.” The GDPR views pseudonymization of personal data as an appropriate technical and organizational measure to achieve “privacy by design” and to ensure the security of data processing.25 It is not to be confused with anonymization of data, which allows use of the data without any restriction.26  2. ePrivacy Directive  The aim of the ePrivacy Directive is to ensure an equivalent level of protection of fundamental rights and freedoms (particularly the right to privacy) with respect to data processing in the electronic communications sector and to ensure the free movement of such data.27 The ePrivacy Directive covers the processing of personal data by traditional telecom providers in public communications networks in the EU and mandates that Member States protect the confidentiality of the content of electronic communications through national legislation.28 In particular, Member                                                  19 Id. art. 5, para. 1.

Data Retention and Location Tracking  1. ePrivacy Directive  The ePrivacy Directive allows processing of traffic and other location data under certain circumstances. Traffic data, defined as “any data processed for the purpose of a conveyance of a communication on an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof,”31 may be processed for billing purposes and must be deleted or made anonymous when no longer needed.32 Traffic data may also be processed for marketing purposes if prior consent from the user was obtained.33 Other location data, defined as “any data processed in an electronic communications network, indicating the geographic position of the terminal equipment of a user of a publicly available electronic communications service,”34 may only be processed after being made anonymous, or with the consent of the users or subscribers, to the extent and for the duration necessary for the provision of a value-added service.35 Value-added services are commonly known as location-based services. Users must be informed whether the data will be transmitted to a third party for the purpose of providing the service and must be able to withdraw consent at any time.36  Furthermore, storing or gaining access to information already stored on a device requires the consent of the user or must be necessary to provide the service.37 The user must be provided with clear and comprehensive information on the purpose of the processing in line with the requirements set out in the GDPR.38  Derogations from the obligations and rights with regard to traffic and other location data, in particular the requirement to obtain consent, are allowed for national or public security reasons or for law enforcement purposes, among others, if the restriction is a necessary, appropriate, and proportionate measure.39                                                  29 Id. art. 5. 30 ePrivacy Regulation Proposal, art. 18. 31 ePrivacy Directive, art. 2(b). 32 Id. art. 6. 33 Id. art. 6, para. 3. 34 Id. art. 2(c). 35 Id. art. 9, para. 1. 36 Id.  37 Id. art. 5, para. 3. 38 Id. 39 Id. art. 6; art. 15, para. 1. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 85  2. Data Retention Directive  The EU Data Retention Directive, which was declared invalid by the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on April 8, 2014, was another EU legislative instrument that is relevant in the context of data protection and storing traffic and location data.40 The CJEU held that the Data Retention Directive violated the right to privacy (article 7), the right to protection of personal data (article 8), and the principle of proportionality (article 52) as codified in the EU Charter.41 The Directive has not been replaced with new EU legislation. Instead, national data retention laws are applicable, but they are subject to review by the CJEU.42 The CJEU stated that data retention obligations and access to that data are only permissible under EU law if they are strictly necessary.43 In the Court’s opinion, EU law precludes national legislation that prescribes general and indiscriminate retention of data.44 The Commission announced in 2017 that it would develop guidance as to how national data retention laws can be constructed to comply with the CJEU ruling; however, such guidance has not yet been released.45  3. Decision on Combating Serious Cross-Border Threats to Health  Decision No. 1082/2013/EU on Combating Serious Cross-Border Threats to Health lays down rules on epidemiological surveillance and on monitoring, early warning, and responsive measures to combat serious cross-border threats to health.46 Recital 25 to the Decision points out that cross-border threats to health   could require the Member States concerned to take particular control or contact-tracing measures in a coordinated manner to identify those persons already contaminated and those persons exposed to risk. Such cooperation could require the exchange of personal data through the system, including sensitive information related to health and information about confirmed or suspected human cases of disease, between those Member States directly involved in the contact-tracing measures.   Data processing for this purpose must comply with the EU data protection framework and must provide specific safeguards for the exchange of personal data.47 In particular, personal data must                                                  40 Data Retention Directive, 2006 O.J.

PERSONAL INFORMATION — First name and surname,  — Nationality, date of birth, sex,  — Country of residence,  — ID type, number and issuing authority,  — Current home/residence address (street name and number, city, country, postal code),  — Telephone numbers (mobile, residential, business),  — Email (private, business). 2. TRAVEL SPECIFICATIONS — Conveyance data (such as flight number, date and length of flight, ship name, plate number), — Seat number(s), — Cabin number(s).                                                   48 Id. art. 16, para. 1. 49 Id. art. 8. 50 Id. art. 9, para. 1. 51 Id. art. 9, para. 3(i). 52 Id. art. 16, para. 7. 53 Id. art. 16, paras. 2, 3. 54 Id. art. 16, para. 5. 55 Id. art. 16, para. 9; Commission Recommendation (EU) 2017/1140, 2017 O.J.

Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A. COVID-19 Mobile Applications  1. General Overview of Apps  As mentioned, the Commission recommends developing mobile apps to help reduce the spread of COVID-19, complemented by other measures such as increased testing capabilities. Its legally non-binding App Guidance issued on April 17, 2020, addresses the development of voluntary apps to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. It does not cover mandatory apps or those enforcing quarantine requirements. In the opinion of the Commission, further analysis is needed for mandatory apps because of the “high degree of intrusiveness of such an approach,” and therefore recommends the use of voluntary apps.57 The App Guidance deals with apps with one or several of the following characteristics:   • provides accurate information to individuals about the COVID-19 pandemic; • has symptom-checker functionality; • has contact tracing and warning functionality; or • increases the use of telemedicine.58                                                   56 Id. Annex. 57 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 2.  58 Id.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 88 The App Guidance states that symptom checker and contact tracing and warning functionalities are useful both for individuals and public health authorities.59 Individuals that have been in contact with an infected person are informed about appropriate next steps, such as testing, self-quarantine, or treatment. Furthermore, the data may be useful in understanding transmission patterns and provide information on virus circulation.60 The Commission recommends interoperability of IT solutions used by the different Member States to enable cross-border collaboration and to ensure contact detection between users of different apps.61  2. Compatibility with Privacy and Data Protection Principles  In a next step, the Commission lays out different elements that are meant to ensure that the mobile apps comply with the EU privacy and personal data protection framework.   a. Designation and Role of Controllers  The Commission recommends the designation of national health authorities or other similar bodies as the controllers of data.62 Controllers are charged with ensuring compliance with data protection rules and must inform individuals of how their data is going to be used.63 Furthermore, as the processing of sensitive health data will likely result in a high risk to the rights and freedoms of individuals, the controller must conduct a prior data protection impact assessment (DPIA).64 The European Data Protection Board (EDPB) recommends publication of the DPIAs.65  b. Individual Control of Data  Secondly, the Commission emphasizes that individuals must remain in control of their data.66 Being “in control” means that   • the download and installation of the app are voluntary and there are no negative repercussions for individuals who chose not to download it;  • consent is given for each individual functionality of the app;  • proximity data is stored on the device and will not be shared unless a person is infected with COVID-19 and consents to the data sharing; • health authorities provide individuals with all necessary information about the processing of their data in line with the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive;                                                  59 Id. at 3, para. 2. 60 Id.  61 Id.  62 Id. at 3, para. 3.1. 63 GDPR, art. 5, para. 2. 64 Id. art. 35. 65 EDPB, supra note 26, para. 39. 66 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 4, para 3.2 \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 89 • individuals are able to exercise their data protection rights, such as access, rectification, and deletion, among others; • restrictions of rights are provided for in a necessary and proportionate law and satisfy the requirements set out in the GDPR and the ePrivacy Directive; and • the app is automatically deleted from the mobile device once the pandemic is declared to be under control.67  c. Consent of the User  Furthermore, the Commission points out that contact tracing and warning apps generally require the storage of information on the device. According to the ePrivacy Directive, storing information or gaining access to information already stored on a device requires either consent of the user or must be necessary to provide the service.68 The Commission explains that as the user may need to upload proximity data, which is not necessary for the operation of the app as such, consent is required.69 Consent according to the GDPR is only valid if it is freely given,70 specific, informed,71 and an unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she signifies agreement to the processing of personal data relating to him or her.72 That means that silence, pre-ticked boxes (checked by default), or inactivity do no constitute valid consent.73 Furthermore, withdrawing consent needs to be as easy as giving consent.74 The EDPB issued guidelines in May 2020 that provide more details on the requirements for valid consent.75  d. Processing for Reasons Other than Consent  The GDPR also allows processing of personal data when it is necessary to comply with a legal obligation to which the controller is subject or when such processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out to further the public interest.76 The Commission states that national laws that were already in place before the COVID-19 pandemic or laws enacted or amended in response to it can provide a valid legal basis for processing personal data in a mobile app if they meet the requirements of the GDPR.77 The legal obligation or public interest task must                                                  67 Id.  68 Id. at 4, para. 3.3; ePrivacy Directive, art. 5, para. 3. 69 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 4, para. 3.3. 70 GDPR, art. 7, para. 4; recital 43. 71 Id. recital 42. 72 Id. art. 4, point (11).  73 Id. recital 32. 74 Id. art. 7, para. 3. 75 EDPB, Guidelines 05/2020 on Consent Under Regulation 2016/679 (May 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/XG4F-YMBL. These guidelines update guidelines previously issued by the Article 29 Working Party in 2018, which were endorsed by the EDPB. See EDPB, Guidelines 05/2020, at 3. 76 GDPR, art. 6, para. 1(c), (e). 77 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 5, para 3.3. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 90 be codified in either EU law or Member State law to which the controller is subject, and that legal basis must identify the purpose of the processing or the processing must be necessary for the performance of the task.78 Furthermore, the legal basis must “meet an objective of public interest and be proportionate to the legitimate aim pursued.”79 In the opinion of the Commission, a generic purpose of “prevention of further COVID-19 infections” is not specific enough for an app with contact tracing and warning functionalities. Instead, it proposes “retaining of the contacts of the persons who use the app and who may have been exposed to infection by COVID-19 in order to warn those persons who could have been potentially infected.”80  The Commission recommends not bundling functionalities and only using the data for the fight against COVID-19. If Member States would like to use the data for additional purposes such a scientific research and statistics, such purposes should be clearly communicated to the user and included in the legal basis.81   The Commission emphasizes that even if there is a valid legal basis that allows the processing of personal data to fight epidemics by national authorities, individuals must remain free to install or de-install a contact tracing and warning app.82   e. Automated Individual Decision-making  If the warnings are issued directly by the app, national authorities also need to abide by the requirements codified in the GDPR for automated individual decision-making.83 The GDPR establishes a general prohibition for decision-making based solely on automated processing that has legal or similarly significant effects. “Solely” means that the decision is totally automated and there is no human review.84 “Legal or similarly significant effects” means that the decision either affects a person’s legal status or rights, such as the denial of a social benefit, or has equivalent impact on an individual’s circumstances, behavior, or choices, or leads to exclusion/discrimination of an individual, such as the denial of an online credit application or access to education.85 However, as an exception, decision-making based solely on automated processing may be performed when it is necessary for the performance of or entering into a contract, is authorized by EU or Member State law to which the controller is subject and which also lays down suitable measures to safeguard the user’s rights and freedoms and legitimate interests, or is based on the user’s explicit consent.86 In addition, for sensitive data such as health                                                  78 GDPR, art. 6, para. 3. 79 Id. 80 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 8, para. 3.6. 81 Id. 82 Id. at 5, para 3.3. 83 Id.; GDPR, art. 22. 84 Article 29 Working Party, Guidelines on Automated Individual Decision-making and Profiling for the Purposes of Regulation 2016/679 20 (Feb. 2018), https://perma.cc/L4GP-26NN.  85 Id. at 21. 86 GDPR, art. 22, para. 2. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 91 data, the processing may only take place when the user has consented or when it is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest and there are sufficient safeguards in place.87   f. Data Minimization  The Commission emphasizes that the apps must abide by the principle of data minimization, meaning that the processing of personal data should be adequate, relevant, and limited to what is necessary.88 For example, an app with symptom checking or telemedicine functionality does not need access to the contact list stored on the device.89 Mobile apps with contact tracing and warning functionality will generally require proximity data from the user. The Commission recommends the use of Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communications data or data generated by equivalent technology for this purpose.90 In the opinion of the Commission, BLE, unlike geolocation data, is more precise, thereby minimizing the risk of having false positives, and avoids the possibility of tracking.91 It should only be recorded when there is an actual risk of infection.92 The Commission advises against the use of location data as it is not necessary for contact tracing.   With regard to the warning of people who have been in close contact with an infected person, the Commission proposes two solutions, a centralized and a decentralized solution. When a user has tested positive and inputs that information into the app, where it is subsequently stored, an automatic alert is sent to the close contacts (decentralized processing). The Commission recommends that the alert message should be drafted by the health authorities. Under the second option, arbitrary temporary identifiers that cannot directly identify the user are stored on a backend server held by the health authorities. Users who have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive receive an alert on their phone through the identifiers (centralized processing). For contact via phone or text message, health authorities would need additional consent of those users.93 The Commission prefers the first solution as it aligns better with the principle of data minimization.94 There is no need to reveal the identity of the infected person to the individuals who have been in close contact with him or her.95                                                      87 Id. art. 22, para. 4. 88 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 5, para. 3.4; GDPR, art. 5, para. 1(c). 89 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 5, para. 3.4. 90 Id. at 6, para. 3.4. 91 Id. at 6, para. 3.4. & 9, para. 3.9. 92 Id. at 6, para. 3.4. 93 Id. 94 Id. at 7, para. 3.5 95 Id. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 92 g. Data Storage Limitation  Data should not be kept longer than necessary for the specific functionality of the app based on medical relevance and administrative processing.96 That means that proximity data for apps with contact tracing and warning functionalities should be deleted after a maximum of one month (incubation period plus margin) or after a negative test result. It may be kept longer in an anonymized form. Only data that is necessary to fulfill the purpose of the app should be uploaded to the server of the health authorities.97  h. Data Security  With regard to data security, the Commission emphasizes encryption and pseudonymization of the data. It advises that the data be stored on the user’s device in an encrypted form with state-of-the-art cryptographic techniques.98 Such techniques could be symmetric and asymmetric encryption, hash functions, private membership test, private set intersection, Bloom filters, private information retrieval, and homomorphic encryption, among others.99 Proximity data should be encrypted and pseudonymized. When proximity data is collected via BLE, the Commission recommends establishing and storing temporary device IDs that change regularly instead of the actual ID.100 Temporary IDs offer more protection against hacking and tracking. Additional security measures proposed are automatic deletion or anonymization of data after a certain time. In general, the more sensitive the data is, the more security is required. The EDPB additionally recommends that a mechanism be established to verify the status of users who log a positive test result in the appfor example, by providing a single-use code linked to a test station or health care professional.101  Furthermore, the Commission states that the source code should be published and be made available for review.102 In the opinion of the Commission and the EDPB, such a review of the algorithm by independent experts will ensure fairness, accountability, and compliance with the law.103  3. Development of a CEN Technical Specification  The European Committee for Standardization (CEN) has been asked by the Commission to develop a new CEN technical specification for “Quality and Reliability of Health and Wellness                                                  96 Id. at 8, para. 3.7. 97 Id.  98 Id. at 8, para. 3.8. 99 EDPB, supra note 26, at 16, no. 8. 100 App Guidance, supra note  4, at 8, para. 3.8. 101 EDPB, supra note 26, at 16, no. 8. 102 App Guidance, supra note 4, at 9, para. 3.8. 103 EDPB, supra note 26, para. 37. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 93 Apps.”104 It is slated to be completed in 2020 and is meant to provide app developers with a consistent set of criteria for such apps. CEN states that such a quality standard will “giv[e] users and health professionals confidence that the apps are fit for purpose, and provid[e] app developers easier access to European markets.”105 The specification will be compatible with the world health informatics standards from the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).  4. Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing Initiative  The Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing Initiative (PEPP-PT) is a consortium made up of various European firms and research institutions that is in the process of developing a software for national contact or proximity tracing apps to fight the spread of COVID-19.106 Several European countries had reportedly announced they would use the software as a basis for developing their own COVID-19 app.107 However, after a controversy over whether a centralized or a decentralized approach should be used and concerns over transparency, several partners dropped out and governments withdrew support.108  B. Use of Mobility Data  Furthermore, the Commission recommends developing a common approach for the use of anonymized and aggregated mobility data to inform measures and exit strategies.109 The EDPB emphasizes that preference should be given to the processing of anonymized data rather than personal data.110 The eHealth Network plans to release a plan for a common approach in June 2020.111 In particular, such mobility data can be used to map and predict the diffusion of the disease and its impact on health system needs in the Member States, optimize the effectiveness of measures to contain the spread of COVID-19, and address its effects. The Commission advises Member States to exchange best practices on the use of mobility data, share and compare modelling and predictions of the spread of the virus, and monitor the impact of measures to limit its spread.112 It emphasizes that the appropriate use of anonymized and aggregated mobility data for modelling needs to be addressed and the methodology that providers used for anonymizing                                                  104 Quality & Reliability for Health and Wellness Apps, CEN, https://perma.cc/HB7W-G72Y. 105 Id. 106 Pan-European Privacy-Preserving Proximity Tracing, PEPP-PT, https://perma.cc/LA59-URUB.  107 Douglas Busvine, European Coronavirus App Platform Gains Traction With Governments, Reuters (Apr. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/Z27T-9Z6F.  108 Douglas Busvine, Rift Opens Over European Coronavirus Contact Tracing Apps, Reuters (Apr. 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/AQM6-VCK3.  109 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/518, supra note 4, at 14, para. 18. 110 EDPB, supra note 26, para. 14. 111 EHealth Network, Mobile Applications, supra note 5, at 24, point V.c. 112 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/518, supra note 4, at 14, para. 19. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: European Union The Law Library of Congress 94 data must be checked for plausibility. Furthermore, safeguards need to be put in place to prevent de-anonymization.113 The EDPB points out that robust anonymization requires examining   • whether data can be singled-out, meaning whether an individual can be isolated in a larger group based on the data; • linkability; and  • inference, meaning whether unknown information about an individual can be deduced with significant probability.114  Data that was accidentally processed must be immediately and irreversibly deleted. All other data should be deleted after 90 days or no later than the end of the pandemic. Lastly, the mobility data should only be used for the aforementioned purposes and not be shared with third parties.115                                                   113 Id. at 14, para. 20. 114 EDPB, supra note 26, para. 16. 115 Commission Recommendation (EU) 2020/518, supra note 4, at 14, para. 20. \fThe Law Library of Congress 95 England Clare Feikert-Ahalt Senior Foreign Specialist   SUMMARY The UK has been one of the hardest hit countries in Europe in both numbers of deaths and cases of infection from COVID-19. The use and sharing of data is regulated by the Data Protection Act, which implements the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation. England is developing an app that will operate via Bluetooth and use a centralized system to alert individuals who have been in close proximity to a user who later reports symptoms of COVID-19. England has also developed a Test and Trace Program, which involves a significant number of people to track and trace the contacts of people who report symptoms of COVID-19 either online, through the app, or via the telephone. There is no new legislation to introduce the app, the use of which is entirely voluntary. While the government has faced criticism for not introducing legislation to underpin the app, it claims that new legislation is not necessary as the use of the app is entirely voluntary and that data is protected under the Data Protection Act 2018 and the Human Rights Act 1998.   I. Introduction  The UK has been one of the most severely hit countries in Europe from COVID-19 in terms of both infections and deaths. As of May 22, 2020, 254,195 people in the UK had tested positive for COVID-19 and there had been 36,393 deaths confirmed with COVID-19 positive test results.1    A significant percentage of the UK’s population has cell phones, with a study from Deloitte reporting that 88% of people in the UK own a smartphone.2 With the high number of smartphones in use across the UK, an app to help automate the process to trace the contacts of individuals with symptoms of COVID-19 could help to reduce the spread of the disease, but this will only work if a significant number of people who have smartphones install the app. A poll from the Observer reported that 52% of people would download an app that enables contact tracing to be conducted automatically via their cell phones3 while another poll indicated that 65% of people are willing to download such an app.4                                                                 1 Cabinet Office Briefing Room, Reducing the Spread of COVID-19, https://perma.cc/GAC8-7GR5. The Office of National Statistics reported 41,020 deaths as of May 8 where COVID-19 was mentioned in the death certificate.

The team responsible for the contact tracing app currently under development in England has stated that 60% of the population needs to download the app in order for it to be effective, although even a 50% uptake will help reduce infections and prevent the health care system from being overwhelmed.5 As a point of reference, approximately 67% of cell phone users have downloaded WhatsApp.6 The models estimating required participation exclude persons over 70 years of age, because they have lower smartphone usage and it is assumed they will typically follow the government’s advice to minimize contact with other people.7   II.  Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection  The UK incorporated the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) into its national law through the Data Protection Act 2018 (the 2018 Act).8 The 2018 Act contains provisions relating to general data processing, and the processing of data by law enforcement and the intelligence services. The 2018 Act also provides for regulatory oversight and enforcement mechanisms to ensure it is implemented properly. It regulates how personal information may be processed, “requiring personal data to be processed lawfully and fairly, on the basis of the data subject’s consent or another specified basis.”9 The 2018 Act also requires that any data collected should be limited in scope, collected only as necessary for the  reasons it is processed, accurate, and kept up to date. Any personal data must be stored in a manner that enables the identification of the data subject and held for no longer than necessary.

Location Tracking  The interpretation of “identifiable living individuals” includes those who can be identified using location data; thus, location data is considered to be personal data and the protections of the 2018 Act in relation to processing, storing, using, and sharing such data apply.16  The Investigatory Powers Act 2016 (the 2016 Act) provides the legal framework for the investigatory powers of law enforcement, public authorities, and the security and intelligence agencies of the UK to obtain communications and communications data. The 2016 Act includes location data under the term “secondary data”17 and allows law enforcement to intercept, acquire, and retain these types of data in specified circumstances, such as in the interests of public safety or to protect public health.18  .  The 2016 Act also provides the Secretary of State with the ability to require telecommunications operators to retain internet connection records, which enable “law enforcement to identify the communications service to which a device has connected online.”19                                                                12 Id.

Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A.  Contract Tracing App  The government has noted that the potential number of asymptomatic carriers of COVID-19 “indicate[s] that the spread of COVID-19 is too fast to be contained by manual contact tracing alone, but containment would be possible using a more efficient method involving a mobile app.”20 In April 2020, the government announced that the National Health Service User Experience21 (NHSX), the technology and research arm of NHS England and the Department of Health and Social Care, and researchers at Oxford University had worked together to develop an app that works on mobile devices to help public health authorities to manage COVID-19.22 It is currently testing the app and plans to release it in England in the beginning of June 2020.23 The aim of the app is to   . . . automate key parts of public health contact tracing by offering a proximity cascade system that can help slow transmission of the COVID-19 virus. This will save lives, reduce pressure on the NHS, help return people to normal life and mitigate damage to the economy.  The app also aims to preserve individual and group privacy, be tolerant to various malicious users and minimise the risks of pseudonymous subgroup reidentification. Importantly, it is driven by and informs expert epidemiological modelling, which in turn drives public policy.24  In order for the app to be the most effective, the government has noted that it needs to be paired with manual contact tracing and widespread testing to ensure that the data is accurate.25   The app was designed not to interfere with other apps or drain phone batteries, and to protect users’ privacy and device security. The app does not work on some older-model cell phones, such as those that do not support Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), leading to concerns that vulnerable groups may be excluded from using the app.26 The app is also reportedly incompatible with the                                                              20 Contact Tracing Apps for COVID-19, UK Parliament POST, supra note 4. 21 Jess Morley, All the Things We Like about the Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation’s New Strategy, Technology in the NHS (Mar. 21, 2019), https://perma.cc/83JW-65DC. 22 Stop the Spread of Coronavirus, NHS, https://perma.cc/T7YQ-JVKC.

Operation of the App  Once installed, the app creates an anonymous, fixed identifier for the user’s cell phone.29 The app generates anonymous tokens and records when two people who have installed the app on their mobile devices are within a certain distance from one another for longer than a specified period of time.30 The app does not use location data, although it does prompt users to provide the first half of their postcode (zip code) to enable the NHS to use the data to see where hotspots are emerging.31   The government has decided to permit users to self-report symptoms as “self-diagnosis can reduce by days, the time it takes a potentially infectious person to isolate. This is critical to the management of the spread of the disease, under the assumptions in the UK’s model.”32 The Parliamentary Office of Science and Technology (POST) has noted that while permitting such self-reporting can reduce the exposure of others to infection while test results are being processed, it could also lead to a number of false positive alerts and that fast testing will be key to ensuring public confidence in the advice provided by the app.33   The NHS has reiterated this, stating that the reason for allowing individuals to self-report symptoms on the app is because  [t]he epidemiological models tell us that any delay in isolating people who are showing symptoms has a real effect on the spread of the virus. The less delay there is, the better the NHS can manage the spread. No testing regime can give immediate results, so the public health professionals have taken the decision to ask people to declare symptoms that are likely to be coronavirus.34  The app asks self-reporting users a series of structured questions to determine if they have symptoms of COVID-19.35 The app then “runs [any contact events with other users of the app] through a sophisticated risk model to work out the encounters that are high risk from a virus transmission point of view.”36 This appears to be based on users having prolonged close contact                                                              27 Contact Tracing Apps for COVID-19, UK Parliament POST, supra note 4. 28 Terence Eden, The Code Behind the NHS Covid-19 App, NHSX (May 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/9GQ7-SMVM.  29 Chowdhury et al., supra note 22.   30 National Cyber Security Centre, High Level Privacy and Security Design for NHS COVID-19 Contact Tracing App (May 2020), https://perma.cc/RR3M-X5MH.  31 Chowdhury et al., supra note 22. 32 National Cyber Security Centre, supra note 30, at 3. 33 Contact Tracing Apps for COVID-19, UK Parliament POST, supra note 4. 34 Levy, supra note 244. 35 Id. 36 Id.   \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: England The Law Library of Congress 100 with one another.37 The data is shared to a centralized health service database38 and all users who were in “significant contact” within the past 28 days39 of the user reporting symptoms are alerted. The app sends recommendations to these users that vary “depend[ing] on the evolving context and approach.”40 The POST has stated that   [c]riteria used to determine whether a user is at risk are based on an understanding of how different levels of exposure (e.g. closeness and duration of contact) affect risk of infection. The app could also make recommendations to manage this risk, such as checking symptoms, reporting to a test centre or self-isolating.41  The identity of the person reporting symptoms is not revealed to other app users; the notification simply informs them that they have been in proximity to a person with symptoms of COVID-1942 and to take certain measures.   In cases where the person reporting symptoms later receives a negative test, contacts are informed through the app that it was a false positive. If the user has a positive test result, the contacts are asked to self-isolate for 14 days and to get tested themselves. If the user reporting symptoms does not get a test and not many of his or her contacts report symptoms, it is considered that this “statistically suggests” the user was not positive and their contacts are informed they do not need to continue to self isolate. If the opposite is true, and a number of the user’s contacts report symptoms, it is considered that the person was probably infected and that their contacts should consider self-isolation.43    There are reports that the app is unable to work properly if another app is being actively used, as it will only start broadcasting its identifier if an identifier is broadcast from another phone. The result of this is that “two iPhone users [who] sat next to each other on a train, both playing the game Candy Crush, would fail to register as a contact, unless a third phone was nearby with the app open.”44  2. Centralized Model   The app uses a centralized model, which means the matching process occurs on a centralized computer server.45 A decentralized model, which was proposed by Apple and Google, would have limited the data exchange to individual users’ cell phones and was rejected by the NHSX,                                                              37 Id. at 4. 38 Chowdhury et al., supra note 222. 39 Id.   40 Gould, supra note 22.   41 Contact Tracing Apps for COVID-19, UK Parliament POST, supra note 4. 42 Lawrie, supra note 6. 43 Levy, supra note 24. 44 Dan Sabbage, Alex Hern & Kate Proctor, UK Racing to Improve Contact-tracing App’s Privacy Safeguards, The Guardian (London) (May 5, 2020), https://perma.cc/4UAM-MHN4.  45 Lawrie, supra note 6.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: England The Law Library of Congress 101 which stated the centralized system will provide it with more insight into how the disease spreads and improve the efficiency of the app.46  3. Voluntary Uptake  Installation and use of the app is entirely voluntary, although a document from the body established to consider the ethics of the app has noted that it is possible the app could be a requirement for individuals returning to work or using public transportation.47 The app also allows people to voluntarily opt in to report their symptoms and when they started feeling unwell.48    4. Trial  The NHS’s contact tracing app was tested on the Isle of Wight, where the island’s 80,000 households were asked to download the app beginning May 5, 2020. The Isle of Wight was selected as the place for trial due to its elderly population and low numbers of cell phone users. The BBC reported that if the trial “is successful despite these challenges then that will show it can work across the UK.”49   The app was downloaded 55,000 times within the first week of being launched, although, as the device does not track location, some downloads may have occurred outside the Isle of Wight.50 By May 14, 2020, around half of the Island’s population had reportedly downloaded the app.51 Any person who voluntarily reports their symptoms during this trial will be brought a test for COVID-19 within 24 hours, according to the Telegraph.52   The test revealed that the app affected the battery power of certain iPhones.53 Concerns have also been raised that delays of up to a week for people to receive test results may undermine the effectiveness of the app. The government has noted that using Bluetooth has both limitations and risks. Bluetooth may miss connections if phones are in bags or pockets that weaken the signal, which in turn can make the distance measurements unreliable.54 Keeping Bluetooth turned on can also pose a security risk. The phone’s unique identifier could be collected by third parties in                                                              46 Id. 47 NHS COVID-19 App: Ethics Advisory Board Terms of Reference, NHSX, https://perma.cc/7FDY-J8ND.  48 Chowdhury et al., supra note 22. 49 Lawrie, supra note 6. 50 Coronavirus: NHS Virus-Tracing App Downloaded 55,000 Times, BBC News (May 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/LLF4-Q2XC.

Contact Tracing for People Without the App   The app is only one part of the UK’s approach to tackling COVID-19. The government has also established the COVID-19 Test and Trace Taskforce,56 which is responsible for ensuring that people who develop symptoms of COVID-19 have fast access to a test to determine if they have the virus. The Test and Trace Taskforce will also conduct manual contact tracing, which was used at the start of the outbreak before the cases of COVID-19 became so widespread,57 to alert people who have had close contact with the person. The aim of this is to   • identify who is infected more precisely, to reduce the number of people who are self-isolating with symptoms but who are not actually infected, and to ensure those who are infected continue to take stringent self-isolation measures; and  • ensure those who have been in recent close contact with an infected person receive rapid advice and, if necessary, self-isolate, quickly breaking the transmission chain.58  The government has noted that it is necessary for testing and contact tracing to  . . . operate quickly for maximum effect, because relative to other diseases (for example SARS) a proportion of COVID-19 sufferers almost certainly become infectious to others before symptoms are displayed; and almost all sufferers are maximally infectious to others as soon as their symptoms begin even if these are initially mild.59  The government is working to ensure that all components of contact tracing are   . . . fully joined up to make the system as seamless as possible for members of the public and to ensure the app complements more traditional measures. This coordinated approach will help protect vulnerable groups, including those who cannot or do not want to use digital tools.60   People with symptoms who see their doctor or receive a positive test result for COVID-19 are being referred by their doctor to the contact tracing team, and individuals will also be able to report their symptoms and order testing for COVID-19 over the phone or online.61 The contact tracing team will then contact the person by phone or email to get a list of people who they have                                                              55 Id. 56 Press Release, Department of Health and Social Care, New Chair of Coronavirus ‘Test and Trace’ Programme Appointed (May 7, 2020), https://perma.cc/2B29-XX5K.  57 Contact Tracing Apps for COVID-19, UK Parliament POST, supra note 4. 58 HM Government, Our Plan to Rebuild: The UK Government’s COVID-19 Recovery Strategy, CP 239, at 38 (May 2020), https://perma.cc/6UDR-T8BY.   59 Id.   60 NHS COVID-19 App, NHSX, https://perma.cc/4P9R-MA52.  61 Lawrie, supra note 6. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: England The Law Library of Congress 103 been in close contact with and places they have visited over the days prior to displaying symptoms, or receiving the positive test result.62 The contact tracer will then call or email individuals on the list and advise them to self-isolate for seven days and call the contact tracing team if they display any symptoms, at which point their contacts will be tracked and asked to self-isolate.63 The design allows the notification that people self-isolate based on the self-reported symptoms of other users to be reversed at a later date if the person later tests negative for COVID-19.64  The app and contact tracing requires a significant amount of human resources to operate effectively. The government aims to have 25,000 people to trace the contacts of people testing positive for COVID-19, with the aim being to track the contacts of 10,000 COVID-19 cases per day by June 1, 2020.65   The UK is also planning to use the Joint Biosecurity Centre to provide analysis and assessment of outbreaks of COVID-19 at the community level in a manner that enables a rapid intervention before the outbreak grows further.66   C.  Compatibility of Measures with Privacy Rights   The government’s COVID-19 Recovery Strategy states that the measures being taken “will involve an unprecedented degree of data-collection . . . [and] the government will enact robust safety measures.”67 These safety measures are not mentioned in the UK Government’s COVID-19 Recovery Strategy. Information collected by the app and through the Test and Trace program will be compiled together and “form part of a core national COVID-19 dataset.”68  The app does not collect any personally identifiable information about the user, nor is the location of the user collected. Users of the app are anonymous, and data collected by the app from users is used for “NHS care, management, evaluation and research.”69 As use of the app is not mandatory, the NHSX notes that it may be deleted at any time by its user70 and any record stored on the user’s phone is deleted after 28 days if the user, or his or her contacts, have made no reports of symptoms or contact with anyone with COVID-19.71                                                               62 Nick Phin, Coronavirus (COVID-19) Expert Interview: What Is Contact Tracing?, Public Health England (Feb. 13, 2020), https://perma.cc/UUH8-5FRH; Press Release, Department of Health and Social Care, Coronavirus Test, Track and Trace Plan Launched on Isle of Wight (May 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/GE29-AUG8.   63 Press Release, supra note 62.  64 Levy, supra note 244. 65 Coronavirus: UK Track and Trace System in Place from June – PM, BBC News, supra note 28.  66 HM Government, Our Plan to Rebuild, supra note 58, at 37.  67 Id. at 39. 68 Id.   69 NHS COVID-19 App, NHSX, supra note 60.  70 Id. 71 Levy, supra note 244. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: England The Law Library of Congress 104  The centralized data collection point has also been designed to ensure security of the data held there, although this data is anonymous “and communicates out to other NHS systems through privacy preserving gateways, so data in the app data can’t be linked to other data the NHS holds.”72 The government has noted that location data for each individual is unique and thus the individual may be able to be identified from their location data alone, even with the data being stored anonymously.73   Concerns have been raised the anonymized data in a centralized model “could be de-anonymized and used for surveillance purposes.”74 The Ada Lovelace Institute and Parliament’s Joint Committee on Human Rights have recommended that primary legislation be introduced to “impose strict purpose and time limitations on technical solutions to support transition from the crisis”75 and to “provide legal clarity about how data gathered by a contact-tracing app could be used, stored and disposed of . . . [to] increase confidence in the app, which would increase uptake and improve the app’s efficiency.”76    The National Cyber Security Centre has stated that the use of anonymized data collected by the app being used to re-identify users is very low. It notes that in other circumstances the re-identification of anonymized users can sometimes occur where  information about an individual is available, such as their age, gender and location, and such data can only apply to a particular person. The National Cyber Security Centre says that that it does not collect enough information to enable such re-identification of users of the app to occur. It does note that users may have to be identified to the NHS, for example for them to take a test, but that “if that happens through the app, the system uses a privacy preserving gateway to be able to link a test to an app Installation ID anonymously”77 and will not connect this information to the person’s identity or NHS record.   The Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) has noted issues arising as a result of the limited development time for the app:  The speed of development means that working transparently and enabling scrutiny is not straightforward. New decisions are taken every day, and sometimes changed a day later as new evidence or technical challenges emerge. Explaining this to the public without                                                              72 Id.  73 Contact Tracing Apps for COVID-19, UK Parliament POST, supra note 4. 74 Isobel Asher Hamilton, 170 Cybersecurity Experts Warn That British Government’s Contact Tracing App Could Be Used to Surveil People Even after Coronavirus Has Gone, Business Insider (Apr. 29, 2020),  https://perma.cc/SJF4-DTHF.  75 Ada Lovelace Institute, Exit Through the App Store?

However, Governments also have a responsibility to protect Article 2 ECHR, the right to life. If the app demonstrably protects lives and can help to ease the constraints of a lockdown, then this is a very relevant factor in assessing the proportionality of any interference with the right to a private life under article 8 ECHR.79  The Joint Committee on Human Rights, as noted above, has called for the government to introduce a legislative basis for the app to help create public trust and possible participation, along with requiring a formal human rights assessment to occur. It has noted that   this degree of formal rights balancing is lacking at present, being left to the NHSX team and its advisory bodies. In particular, Parliamentary scrutiny would allow for consideration as to whether the use of a centralised system, as opposed to a decentralised system, is reasonable and proportionate. The implementation and oversight of this app must, in our view, be urgently placed on a legislative footing; if rolled out without being governed by a clear legislative framework it risks not complying with the provisions of the ECHR.80  Despite calls for the app to be placed on a legislative basis, the government has maintained that this is not required because use of the app is voluntary and protections currently provided by the Data Protection Act and Human Rights Act are sufficient.81  D.   Oversight Mechanisms  The NHS established an App Oversight Board and an independent Ethics Advisory Board82 (EAB) to ensure that any questions about ethics, privacy, and security “are properly explored and addressed.”83 The EAB provides advice, guidance, and recommendations on ethical issues raised by the use of the app to the App Oversight Board.84                                                                78 Centre for Data Ethics and Innovation, The Ethics of Contact Tracing Apps: International Perspectives (May 12, 2020), https://perma.cc/TJG2-JB49.  79 House of Commons & House of Lords Joint Committee on Human Rights, Human Rights and the Government’s Response to Covid-19: Digital Contact Tracing, (2019-21) HC 343 HL 59 ¶ 3, https://perma.cc/8ECH-3L9P.   80 Id. at 3.  81 Id.

The GDPR’s provisions have been incorporated into the 1978 Loi Informatique et Libertés, France’s original information privacy law. Information technology must not infringe upon human identity, human rights, privacy, or individual or public freedoms. Furthermore, personal data must be processed lawfully and fairly, and data that falls under the GDPR should also be processed in a manner that is transparent for the data subject. Mishandling personal data is a criminal offense under the French Penal Code. The main enforcement authority for issues of technology and privacy is the Commission nationale de l’informatique et des libertés (CNIL), an independent agency.     As a general rule, data may not be retained in a manner that allows the data subjects’ identification beyond the time necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected. Location tracking of individuals falls squarely in the GDPR’s definition of “personal data,” and may only be collected and processed under the conditions laid out by that regulation. The Loi Informatique et Libertés contains several provisions regarding the handling of personal data related to health care, which may be collected and used only for certain limited purposes.   The French government has developed two electronic databases to help in the fight against the spread of COVID-19. The SI-DEP database is a secure platform where all COVID-19 test results are recorded to ensure that all positive cases are taken care of by the French health care system. The “Contact COVID” database collects information on positive cases, such as where they live and work, and who they are in regular contact with, to facilitate contact tracing. Additionally, the French government is deploying a smartphone app, called StopCovid, to help with contact tracing. This app, which is used on a purely voluntary basis, relies on Bluetooth technology to notify its user if he or she has been in close proximity to a person infected by COVID-19 for 15 minutes or more. This app is controversial and has elicited concerns over whether it is lawful under French and European privacy laws. The CNIL has issued two opinions declaring it to be legal, so long as certain conditions are respected. The French Parliament approved the app’s deployment in a nonbinding vote on May 27, 2020.    I. Introduction  France, like many other countries, has been hard-hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. According to the French government, there have been 149,071 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in France as of May 28, 2020, and a total of 28,662 deaths from that disease.1 France has taken several important                                                  1 COVID-19, Données au 28/05/2020, Gouvernement.fr (May 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/Q8PK-PTVD.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 108 Regulating Electronic Means to Fight the COVID-19: France measures to fight COVID-19’s spread, including declaring a new type of state of emergency in March 2020.2 Contact tracing appears to be an important tool in the fight against COVID-19, and France is using some technological solutions to facilitate or supplement this process. One of these solutions is the deployment of a smartphone app, capitalizing on the broad penetration of smartphones in the French market. Indeed, about 95% of French residents had a mobile phone in 2019, including approximately 77% who had a smartphone.3 II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionThe French Civil Code provides that all people have a right to privacy.4 However, data protection in France is primarily governed by the European Union’s (EU’s) General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),5 and by the domestic Loi Informatique et Libertés (Law on Information Technology and Freedoms).6 The latter was originally adopted in 1978, but has been amended many times since. For example, it was amended in 2004 to incorporate provisions from the EU’s ePrivacy Directive,7 and it was amended in 2018 to be consistent with the GDPR and the EU’s Directive 2016/680 on processing of personal data.8 The Loi Informatique et Libertés states that information technology “should not infringe upon human identity, human rights, privacy, or public or individual freedoms.”9 Personal data must be processed lawfully and fairly, and data that falls under the GDPR should also be processed in a manner that is transparent for the data 2 Nicolas Boring, France: Government Adopts Law Declaring and Defining a ‘State of Health Emergency,’ Global Legal Monitor (Mar. 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/22VB-CM6Z.  3 Proportion d’individus disposant d’un téléphone mobile en France de 2005 à 2019, Statista (Mar. 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/RWG9-FJSM; Répartition de la population en France de 2011 à 2019, selon le type de téléphone mobile utilisé, Statista (Mar. 5, 2020), https://perma.cc/BM53-J67A.  4 Code civil, art. 9, https://perma.cc/UPQ8-MH6K.  5 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 2016 O.J.

Data Retention  As a general rule, data may not be retained in a manner that allows the data subjects’ identification beyond the time necessary to fulfill the purpose for which it was collected.16 The main exception is that data, even personal information, may be retained for archival purposes, for historical or scientific research, or for statistical purposes. Even within this exception, however, the data must be kept in a manner that complies with the GDPR, and it may not be used to make decisions concerning the data subjects.17 Additionally, data must be kept in a manner that adequately protects personal information from being lost, destroyed, damaged, or used in an illegal or unauthorized manner.18  Data that is found to be inaccurate with regard to the purpose for which it was collected should be immediately corrected or erased.19 Additionally, data subjects have a right to demand that their personal data be erased.20 Furthermore, the CNIL has the authority to demand that data be corrected or erased if it finds that the GDPR or other legal requirements have not been respected.21                                                   10 Id. art. 4. 11 Id. 12 Code pénal, arts. 226-16 to 226-24, https://perma.cc/UCG5-CHKV.  13 Id. 14 Loi Informatique et Libertés, art. 8. 15 Id. 16 Id. art. 4. 17 Id. 18 Id. 19 Id. 20 Id. arts. 51, 106. 21 Id. art. 20. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the COVID-19: France  The Law Library of Congress 110 C. Location Tracking  Location tracking of individuals falls squarely in the GDPR’s definition of “personal data,” and is in fact one of the criteria listed to define an “identifiable natural person.”22 Location tracking in France is therefore primarily governed by the GDPR and the Loi Informatique et Libertés. Location tracking data may only be processed if at least one of the following conditions is fulfilled:   - The data subject has explicitly given consent under conditions defined in the GDPR,  - Processing is necessary for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party or in order to take steps at the request of the data subject prior to entering into a contract,  - Processing is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation,  - Processing is necessary in order to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of another natural person,  - Processing is necessary for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest or in the exercise of official authority vested in the controller,  - Processing is necessary for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party, except when such interests are overridden by the interests or fundamental rights and freedoms of the data subject which require protection of personal data, in particular when the data subject is a child.23  D. Data Related to Health Care  The Loi Informatique et Libertés contains several provisions regarding the handling of personal data related to health care. Personal health care data may only be collected and processed for a purpose of public benefit, such as ensuring high quality and safety standards for medication and health care practices.24 Organizations that wish to collect or process personal health care data must either provide prior notice to the CNIL if the collection and processing fall within certain published guidelines, or request the CNIL’s prior authorization if they fall outside these guidelines.25 An exemption exists, however, for organizations that collect or process data for the sole purpose of responding to a health emergency.26 This exemption only applies to organizations that have a public service mission and are on a list established by the Minister of Health, with the                                                  22 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), art. 4, point (1).  23 Id. art. 6; Loi Informatique et Libertés, art. 5. 24 Loi Informatique et Libertés, art. 66. 25 Id. 26 Id. art. 67. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the COVID-19: France  The Law Library of Congress 111 CNIL’s advice.27 In any case, health care professionals who provide data from their patients to an organization authorized to collect this data must do so in a manner that guarantees confidentiality.28 If the results of the data processing are made public, it must be in such a manner that the direct or indirect identification of the data subjects is impossible.29 Furthermore, the data subjects must be informed in accordance with the requirements of the GDPR.30 The Loi Informatiques et Libertés contains similar provisions for data collection and processing for the purposes of health-care-related research.31   III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A. Contact-COVID and SI-DEP Databases  On May 13, 2020, the French government deployed two electronic databases to help fight the spread of COVID-19.32 These databases were authorized by Parliament two days before, as part of a law that extended the state of emergency related to the COVID-19 pandemic.33 Indeed, this law authorized the implementation of a computerized database “for the sole purposes of fighting against the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic, and for the amount of time strictly necessary for this goal or, at most, a period of six months after the end of the state of emergency [related to the epidemic].”34 As an exception to the legislation on the confidentiality of personal medical information, this database may include relevant personal information even without the data subject’s consent.35 The Constitutional Council, which judges the constitutionality of French laws, was asked to review the bill before it became law. In its opinion, the Council stated that while aspects of the proposed database violated the right to privacy, these violations were necessary for, and justified by, the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.36 The Council did warn, however, that “a particular vigilance must be observed” with regard to the use of personal data of a medical nature.37                                                   27 Id. 28 Id. art. 68. 29 Id. 30 Id. art. 69. 31 Id. arts. 72 to 77. 32 Décret n° 2020-551 du 12 mai 2020 relatif aux systèmes d'information mentionnés à l'article 11 de la loi n° 2020-546 du 11 mai 2020 prorogeant l'état d'urgence sanitaire et complétant ses dispositions, May 13, 2020, https://perma.cc/LY6U-U6NS; Coronavirus : le fichier de suivi des malades \"Contact Covid\" entre en vigueur, L’Express (May 13, 2020), https://perma.cc/5UBG-3GTT.   33 Loi n° 2020-546 du 11 mai 2020 prorogeant l'état d'urgence sanitaire et complétant ses dispositions, May 12, 2020, https://perma.cc/EZD9-5MSP.  34 Id. art. 11. 35 Id. 36 Conseil constitutionnel, decision No. 2020-800DC, May 11, 2020, https://perma.cc/ZP6Q-99XX.  37 Id. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the COVID-19: France  The Law Library of Congress 112 The two databases that came out of this legislative authorization are called “Contact COVID” and SI-DEP.38 SI-DEP, which stands for Système d’Informations de DEPistage (Screening Information System) is a secure platform where all COVID-19 test results are recorded to ensure that all positive cases are taken care of by the French health care system.39 “Contact COVID” collects information on positive cases, and is meant to facilitate contact tracing. The information collected includes the data subject’s identity and contact information, the identity and contact information of people they are close to, their frequent contacts, their workplace, whether they display clinical symptoms, information on their general state of health, and whether they are homeless or in an otherwise vulnerable situation.40  Contact COVID is managed by the national health insurance organization, while SI-DEP is managed by a partnership between the Ministry of Health, the Paris public hospital system, the French public health agency, and medical laboratories throughout the country.41 The data in both systems may only be accessed by medical professionals who are subject to duties of medical confidentiality: doctors, pharmacists, testing laboratory technicians, and other professionals accredited by the national health insurance organization, the national public health agency, or regional public health agencies.42  B. StopCovid Smartphone App  The French government deployed a contact tracing app, called “StopCovid,” on June 2, 2020.43 This app uses Bluetooth technology, rather than geolocation, to detect whether the user was, for a period of 15 minutes or more, within one meter of a person infected with COVID-19.44 Installation and use of this app is on a purely voluntary basis.45  This app has been in development since April 2020, but was delayed by technical difficulties as well as legal uncertainties.46 Unlike many other countries, France opted for a system in which data was stored on a central server controlled by the public health authorities. This led to                                                  38 Contact-COVID et SI-DEP, les outils numériques du dépistage COVID-19,  Ministère des Solidarités et de la Santé (May 26, 2020), https://perma.cc/8HR8-7XVA.  39 Id. 40 Id. 41 Id. 42 Id. 43 Déconfinement: Edouard Philippe \"invite\" les Français à utiliser l'application de traçage StopCovid, disponible à partir du 2 juin, France Info (May 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/B5LD-BWX2.  44 Id. 45 Fabien Soyez, StopCovid: Ce qu'il faut savoir sur l'application de traçage du gouvernement, CNET France (May 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/T35T-LYSM.  46 Damien Leloup, Application StopCovid: La France isolée dans son bras de fer avec Apple et Google, Le Monde (Apr. 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/N3DZ-S82W.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the COVID-19: France  The Law Library of Congress 113 disagreements with both Google and Apple, the designers of the two most common operating systems for smartphones, who favored a more decentralized concept.47  The legal uncertainties around the StopCovid app mostly had to do with whether it is an illegal infringement of the right to privacy. To clarify this issue, the government sought advice from the CNIL twice. The CNIL issued one opinion on April 24, 2020, and the second on May 25, 2020.   In its April 24th opinion, the CNIL found that the proposed app did not infringe the GDPR or other privacy legislation, so long as it is truly useful to deal with the COVID-19 crisis and certain privacy guarantees are built in.48 The CNIL stated that use of the app needed to be purely voluntary, and that there should be no negative repercussion for not using it.49 Furthermore, according to the CNIL, this app must be temporary, and the data gathered must be preserved only for a limited amount of time.50 The CNIL also made some recommendations to ensure the security of the data collected, including the advice that only state-of-the-art cryptographic algorithms should be used to ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the app and database.51 In its May 25th opinion, the CNIL found that the recommendations that it had issued on April 24 appeared to have been followed, and that the app could be legally deployed.52 However, the CNIL required that the app’s actual utility be evaluated after its deployment, and stated that the continued use of StopCovid should be contingent on the results of regular evaluations.53 The CNIL also recommended that the app’s source code be made public in its entirety, though details of the security measures and software parameters should remain secret.54  In an effort to quell the controversies and promote public acceptance of StopCovid, the government submitted its deployment to a nonbinding vote by Parliament on May 27.55 In defending the app before the National Assembly, the government specified that StopCovid was only one tool out of several to fight against the COVID-19 epidemic, and that its purpose was to complement rather than replace the work of contact tracing teams.56 The National Assembly                                                  47 Id. 48 CNIL, Délibération n° 2020-046 du 24 avril 2020 portant avis sur un projet d’application mobile dénommée « StopCovid » (Apr. 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/99NP-H5WU.  49 Id. at 5. 50 Id. at 7. 51 Id. at. 10. 52 CNIL, Délibération n° 2020-056 du 25 mai 2020 portant avis sur un projet de décret relatif à l’application mobile dénommée « StopCovid » (May 25, 2020), https://perma.cc/SU5V-3F7A.  53 Id. at 4. 54 Id at 12. 55 Elsa Bembaron, L’application StopCovid approuvée à l’Assemblée et au Sénat, Le Figaro (May 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/3JPX-6PUG.  56 Assemblée Nationale, Compte rendu intégral, Séance du mercredi 27 mai 2020 (May 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/WU3C-QRXG.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the COVID-19: France  The Law Library of Congress 114 approved the deployment of StopCovid by 338 votes against 215.57 The Senate also expressed its approval.58                                                     57 Id. 58 Elsa Bembaron, supra note 55. \fThe Law Library of Congress 115 Iceland Elin Hofverberg Foreign Law Specialist SUMMARY Privacy is a constitutionally protected right under Icelandic law. As a European Economic Area member, Iceland is bound by some EU legislation, and has implemented both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications. Under the GDPR, Iceland permits the collection, storage, and sharing of personal data (including location data) in a limited number of cases, such as when there is public interest or following consent.  As of May 22, 2020, Iceland only had two active cases of COIVD-19 infection, with 1,791 patients recovered and ten fatalities, making it one of the countries globally that has most successfully managed to stem the spread of the disease. Iceland has launched a COVID-19 transmission app to contact trace infections. The app tracks and saves the location of users on their smartphones. If a user is later confirmed infected with COVID-19, the Icelandic Contact Tracing Team requests access to the location data from the phone. While the app has been downloaded by 40% of the population, it has mainly served to complement ordinary contact tracing methods.   I. IntroductionA. COVID-19 in NumbersIceland is one of the world’s smallest independent nations. It is an island in the North Atlantic sea with approximately 350,000 inhabitants.1  Iceland is considered one of the countries that have, so far, successfully limited the spread of COVID-19 within its populace.2 Iceland reported its first COIVD-19 case on February 28, 2020.3 Iceland has, as of May 22, 2020, reported 1,803 confirmed cases and 10 fatalities from COVID-19.4 Of the total confirmed cases, 1,791 patients have recovered.5 Currently, there are only two active cases, and the country has not recorded any new cases since May 12, 2020.6 There are currently 1 The World Factbook: Iceland, CIA, https://perma.cc/PES2-Y39T. 2 Thomas K.

Smartphone Use  Smartphone use is widespread in Iceland, with the number of Icelandic cell phone subscriptions outnumbering the total population.10 With 238,395 contract subscriptions, about 80% of all cell phone users are using the 4G network.11 It is unclear how willing the population is to share the data.   C. The Rakning C-19 App  On April 19, 2020, Iceland introduced a mobile app to trace people with COVID-19.12 The app, Rakning C-19,13 is available via the Apple Store,14 as well as Google Play.15 The app was designed on behalf of the Contingency, Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management.16 Reportedly, close to 40% of all Icelanders have downloaded the COVID-19 app, making it the most widely downloaded app in any one country as measured per capita.17 However, some commentators claim that it has not been a “game changer.”18 Reportedly, the purpose of the app is to help users refresh their memory, and representatives from Iceland treat the app more as a complement to ordinary contact tracing than as a stand-alone approach.19 There is no requirement to use the app for either infected or uninfected persons. Persons in quarantine are also not required to use the app. Persons in quarantine and isolation are, however, required to check in                                                  7 Id.  8 Id. 9 COVID-19 Coronavirus Pandemic, Worldometer (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/93LJ-8FNK.   10 Tölfræði um íslenska fjarskiptamarkaðinn Fyrri helmingur ársins 2019 [Statistics on the Icelandic Telecommunications Market: The First Half of 2019] (Nov. 2019), PFS, https://perma.cc/4VVP-2JNW. 11 Id. at 18; see also Statistics Report on the Icelandic Telecommunications Market in 2019, Iceland Post & Telecom Admin.

Travel Restrictions in Force  Iceland, as a Schengen Area nation, normally allows European Union citizens to enter the country without border checks.23 Nevertheless, on April 24, 2020, it closed its borders to noncitizens and currently requires everyone arriving in Iceland, regardless of nationality, to self-quarantine for 14 days.24 If subject to self-quarantine, a person must stay home for 14 days but may use a taxi to visit a doctor or a dentist.25 A person in quarantine may not, however, shop for groceries in person or take public transport.26 Quarantine is not a total isolation, but a person in quarantine should limit contacts with others to a minimum.27 In addition to international travelers, persons who have come in contact with a person with COVID-19 also must self-quarantine.28 As of May 22, 2020, a total of 20,194 persons have completed a self-quarantine in Iceland, and another 886 are currently self-quarantining.29 Self-quarantining is less restrictive than isolation, but persons must follow the guidelines.30 Under Icelandic law, persons who have COVID-19 must isolate for the duration of their illness, meaning they must stay at home alone or together with a person who is also isolating.31 Persons who are not sick may isolate together with the sick individual but should not come within one meter (three feet) of the sick person, and if another person in the household                                                  20 Directorate of Health Iceland, Instructions for Persons Under Home-Based Quarantine, https://perma.cc/7L4H-VLJH; Directorate of Health Iceland, Instructions for Persons Under Home-Based Isolation, https://perma.cc/V5TQ-MRPG.  21 Todd Bishop, COVID-19 Lessons from Iceland: How One Nordic Country Has All but Stopped the Virus in Its Tracks, GeekWire (May 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/RKS6-LG4G. 22 Id.  23 Schengen Area, Eur.

The punishment may take the form of up to 6 years’ imprisonment in the case of diseases which the authorities have taken special measures to contain or to prevent their entering the country.36  Currently, the Rakning C-19 app is not used to monitor compliance with the quarantine or isolation rules.  II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionIceland regulates privacy rights and data protection. The Icelandic Constitution guarantees the right to privacy in article 71.37 However, such rights may be limited “by statutory provisions if this is urgently necessary for the protection of the rights of others.”38 Iceland is also a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to privacy in article 8.39 As a European Economic Area (EEA) member, Iceland is bound by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).40 Moreover, because of its EAA membership, Iceland must also 32 Id. 33 Id. 34 COVID-19 in Iceland—Statistics, Directorate of Health Iceland and Dep’t of Civ.

Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  As discussed in section I.C. above, Iceland has developed a smartphone app, the Rakning-19 app, to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic. The app has received international recognition as being one of the least invasive apps from a privacy perspective.78   The app collects location data and retains it for 30 days on the user’s smartphone.79 To use the app, the smart phone must allow GPS tracking.80 It does not track who you have been in contact with, as the data is only saved on the user’s phone, and the Department of Civil Protection and Emergency Management’s Contact Tracing Team sends a request to users who have been diagnosed with COVID-19 to share its previously recorded data with the Contact Tracing Team Database.81 To share the data, an individual must type his or her ID number into the app.82 Once                                                  71 Act on Data Protection and the Processing of Personal Data art. 1.  72 Id. art. 38.  73 Id. arts. 45 and 46.  74 Id. art. 45. 75 Id. art 46.  76 Id.  77 Álit um skrár Embættis landlæknis, Personuvernd (May 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/E66E-FVTV; Álit um skrár Embættis landlæknis: Mál nr. 2020010064, Personuvernd (May 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/VM9E-LZ86.  78 Patrick Howell O’Neill et al., A Flood of Coronavirus Apps Are Tracking Us.

A national task force composed of different professionals is currently reviewing a national plan with proposals that would be implemented by legislation. The proposed measures include the use of apps on a voluntary and anonymous basis by citizens, as well as tracing and data-sharing technologies. Issues concerning respect for European Union law and Italian constitutional standards are being weighed in the decision to implement new technological measures.    I. Introduction  A.   Current Statistics on COVID-19  According to Italy’s Health Ministry, as of May 22, 2020, the current situation in the country with respect to COVID-19 is as follows:1   • Currently positive: 59,322 cases. • Dead from COVID-19: 32,616 cases. • Recovered from COVID-19: 136,720 cases.  B.  Mobile Phone Statistics  As of 2020, about 44 million Italians are smartphone users.2   II.  Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   The Italian Constitution3 guarantees the inviolable freedom and confidentiality of correspondence and of every other form of communication. Other legislation and regulations protect privacy rights and data.

B. Data Retention and Location Tracking  Law No. 167 of 2017 regulates data retention in Italy.14 That law implements EU directives and amends provisions of the Italian Criminal Procedure Code and other legislation to state that telecommunication operators must retain “telephone and telematic traffic data as well as data relating to unanswered calls” for a period of 72 months.15 The requirement that such voluminous data be retained for this length of time has been criticized on privacy grounds.16  The European Data Portal contains information on the portions of Italian territory for which specific COVID-19 containment measures have been adopted.17 In the case of Italy,18 mobile carriers are reportedly sharing data with health authorities to fight the coronavirus by monitoring whether people are complying with lockdowns or other movement restrictions.19 This data is said to be “anonymous and aggregated,” and “make[s] it possible to map concentrations and movements of customers in ‘hot zones’ where COVID-19 has taken hold.”20 Italians mobile carriers Telecom Italia, Vodafone, and WindTre have offered to gather and deliver aggregated data to the authorities in order to monitor people’s movements.21                                                                 11 Id. 12 Coronavirus: Information from the Italian Supervisory Authority, Garante per la Protezione dei Dati Personali, https://perma.cc/6UEJ-TDZ7. 13 Regulation No. 2016/679, art. 51. 14 Legge 20 novembre 2017, n. 167 Disposizioni per l’Adempimento degli  Obblighi Derivanti dall’Appartenenza dell’Italia all’Unione Europea - Legge Europea 2017, G.U., Nov. 27, 2017, https://perma.cc/JNG6-MPV6. 15 Id. art. 24(1). 16 Luigi Garofalo, Data Retention a 6 Anni, OK dal Parlamento (Nonostante la Privacy), Key4Biz (Nov. 8, 2017), https://perma.cc/KDC4-NPAW. 17 COVID-19 Monitoring of the Italian Situation (RNDT – Series), European Data Portal, https://perma.cc/A4Z3-MZUV. 18 Costica Dumbrava, European Parliamentary Research Service, Tracking Mobile Devices to Fight Coronavirus 6 (EPRS Briefing, Apr. 2020), https://perma.cc/87WG-82CL. 19 Elvira Pollina & Douglas Busvine, European Mobile Operators Share Data for Coronavirus Fight, Reuters, https://perma.cc/7UCG-P96K. 20 Id. 21 Id. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Italy The Law Library of Congress 127  The Lombardy region has ued such data to determine observance of lockdown measures; movements exceeding 300 to 500 yards are reportedly down by around 60% from late February when the first case was discovered in the Codogno area.22   III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread According to the Italian Health Ministry, a surveillance network on new COVID-19 cases, controls, and screening is currently active under the coordination of a national task force established to regulate the use of technology to fight the spread of COVID-19.23 Since January 31, 2020, when a state of emergency was declared, a Special Commissioner for the emergency has been appointed and a technical-scientific committee has been established to deal with emergencies.24 The national task force is soon to announce potential technological solutions to trace and isolate those who have tested positive for COVID-19.25 Tech companies and research institutions have provided suggestions to the Italian government, including one proposal “that would analyze user data from Facebook to determine the mass movement of people.”26 Facebook’s Data for Good unit “has been sharing aggregated data collected from location tracking software on mobile phones with researchers at the University of Pavia,” while an extant proposal would also review ways to use from Facebook’s GeoInsights portal.27  A broadly used and voluntary application adopted by the government of Lombardy requests users “to fill out a questionnaire with their symptoms to build a map indicating the risk of contagion.”28 The app, called “AllertaLOM,” captures “a phone’s IMEI code, the unique serial number that all smartphones carry, and the user’s IP address.”29 The app is available from the Apple, Google Play, and Huawei stores.30 It enables all users, whether symptomatic or not, to fill in an integrated questionnaire enabling the collection of data, in an anonymous format, and to make it available to the regional crisis unit and other authorities monitoring the spread of the pandemic in the Lombardy region.31 The app was developed by the digital company ARIA S.p.A. in collaboration with the San Matteo Hospital and the University of Pavia.32 It allows the authorities to compile statistic and epidemiological information that can be used to calculate the                                                              22 Id. 23 Coronavirus: La Situazione Attuale,

proposals have triggered an ongoing discussion in Italy as to the level of privacy rights and data protection that these new technologies would afford to citizens.34 Some argue that, based on the extent of the pandemic in Italy, “concerns about user privacy and data sharing should be temporarily put on hold.”35 The national Constitution allows for measures aimed at protecting the health of a whole nation.36  In April, a company called Webtek released an app called “StopCovid19.” The app traces the movements of users using GPS by having users connect their phone numbers to the app, which in turn uploads their location into a database, so only health authorities may determine the contacts a person who has tested positive with COVID-19 has had in a determined period of time and venue.37 In particular, the app “would record when the user came into proximity with another smartphone user with the app, for how long and at what distance and if a person tested positive for the coronavirus, authorities would be able to trace the contacts and alert them.”38 The system would make “it possible to warn someone who comes into close contact with someone who then tests positive for COVID-19,

Decree-Law No. 28, which creates the COVID-19 Alert System, which is designed to alert people who have had close contact with those who have tested positive for COVID-19 in order to protect their health through preventive measures.41 The Alert System is based on an application to be installed voluntarily by citizens on their mobile telephones.42 All data is compiled by several layers of government authorities coordinated by the Ministry of Health, which must ultimately adopt all the measures necessary to guarantee an adequate level of security, considering the risks involved and the

Personal data may typically be stored for purposes of a public need and may specifically be used and shared to prevent the spread of contagious diseases. Norway has launched a physical location tracking app, Smittestopp, to locate and prevent the spread of COVID-19. The app, which is available for download to Android, Google, and Huawei smartphones, uses both Bluetooth technology and GPS to track users who are in close proximity, defined as within two meters (about six feet) of each other for at least fifteen minutes. Downloading the app is voluntary, and once downloaded the app requires consent in order for the Norwegian Institute of Public Health to track the location of the person. The information is deleted after thirty days.   The Norwegian Data Protection Authority, Datatilsynet, is currently investigating whether the app complies with Norwegian and international data protection rules. An expert committee has recommended that changes be made to the app to enable further anonymization and prevent individual identification.   I. IntroductionA. COVID-19 InfectionsNorway has a low rate of infection and deaths related to COVID-19 and a high rate of testing.1 As of May 22, 2020, it had 8,309 confirmed cases and 235 fatalities from COVID-19,2 the equivalent of 43 deaths per million residents.3 Norway reported its first confirmed case of COVID-19 on February 24, 2020.4 On March 12, 2020, it reported its first fatality.5 On May 22, 2020, it reported no new deaths from COVID-19.6 During the prior week a total of 15 persons were reported to have died from COVID-19.7 1 On May 22, 2020, Norway ranked below the world average for both deaths per million and number of total infections.

Smartphone Use  The use of smartphones is widespread in Norway. In 2019, Statistics Norway (Statistisk Sentralbyrå, SSB) reported that close to 100% of Norwegians age 9 to 79 have a cellular phone, and 95% have a smartphone,8 not counting any smartphone access persons may have via their work.9 Most users use either Telenor or Telia; Telenor has the largest market share of account subscribers with almost half of the market (48.9%), with Telia at 37.2%.10    II. Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   The Norwegian Constitution guarantees the right to privacy in article 102, which states that “[e]veryone has a right to respect for his or her personal life and family life, as well as his or her home and communication. House searches may not be conducted, except during criminal investigations. State authorities shall ensure the protection of personal integrity.”11 In addition, Norway is a signatory to the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees the right to privacy in article 8.12   Norway regulates privacy rights and data protection in its Personal Information Act.13 Though not a European Union (EU) Member State, it is bound by the EU legislation on personal data, namely the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR),14 because of its obligations as a member of the European Economic Area (EEA) and European Free Trade Agreement (EFTA). In 2018 the EEA Joint Committee signed on to the GDPR legislation in order to ensure harmonized rules on                                                              8 Fakta om Internet tog mobil, Andel som har tilgang til ulike elektroniske tilbud, personer 9-79 år, SSB, https://perma. cc/A8GD-7VL6; Statisk sentralbyra, Norsk mediebarometer 2019 at 5 (May 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/XQL3-7NYL; see also Number of Mobile Phone Users in Norway from 2011 to 2019, Statista, https://perma.cc/8K84-DZLJ; Forecast of Smartphone User Numbers in Norway from 2018 to 2024, Statista, https://perma.cc/L4E6-LUGH.  9 Fakta om Internet tog mobil, supra note 8.  10 Marius Lorentzen, Ferske mobiltall: Ice vokser – Telenor og Telia faller, E24 (May 13, 2019), https://perma.cc/97QE-9YUG.  11 § 102 Grunnloven [Norwegian Constitution] (LOV-1814-05-17), https://perma.cc/M2JC-N95A (translation by author).  12 Council of Europe, European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms, as amended by Protocols Nos. 11 and 14, https://perma.cc/XP8C-Z7HJ; see also NIM, «Smittestopp» og retten til privatliv (May 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/2DWB-USXN.  13 Lov om behandling av personopplysninger (Personopplysningsloven) (LOV-2018-06-15-38) (hereinafter Personal Information Act), https://perma.cc/BK6V-66KK (in English translations, also known as the “Protection of Data Act”).  14 General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), 2016 O.J.

Point (f) of the first subparagraph shall not apply to processing carried out by public authorities in the performance of their tasks.19                                                                15 EEA Joint Committee Decision 154/20182018 O.J.

Data Retention and Location Tracking  The telecommunications sector is regulated by the Electronic Communication Act.37 However, location tracking is primarily regulated through the Personal Information Act as, per the GDPR, the definition of personal data includes location data.38 As mentioned above, the Personal Information Act authorizes the Personal Data Authority to handle and retain personal data in individual cases, if in the public interest.39 Similarly, the government may issue specific regulations pertaining to data retention.40 Telecommunication service providers may store data, including location data, but only for as long as needed; they must delete or anonymize the data when no longer needed.41   C. Enforcement   Datatilsynet, the Norwegian Data Protection Authority, is the supervisory authority for the collection and use of personal data in Norway.42  Violations are subject to monetary fines, including compulsory fulfillment fines that run until the violation has been corrected.43 Violations are also subject to damages for nonmonetary losses caused by the breach of the data protection rules.44  D. COVID-19 Tracing Legislation On March 27, 2020, the Norwegian Ministry of Health and Care Services issued a regulation on tracing and epidemic contagion related to COVID-19.45 The regulation was adopted with the                                                              34 Id. §§ 3-6.  35 Prop. 56 LS (2017–2018) at 264. 36 GDPR recital 112. 37 Lov om elektronisk kommunikasjon (Ekomloven) (LOV-2003-07-04-83), https://perma.cc/8ZCY-MCZU.  38 GDPR art. 4(1).  39 Personal Information Act § 7.  40 Id.  41 Ekomloven § 2-7. 42 Personal Information Act § 20.  43 Id. §§ 26, 29.  44 Id. § 30. 45 Forskrift om digital smittesporing og epidemikontroll i anledning utbrudd av Covid-19 (FOR 2020-03-27-475), https://perma.cc/UKS8-5Y5W.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Norway The Law Library of Congress 135 purpose of making it easier to track COVID-19 cases and prevent community spread46 based on authorization provided by temporary emergency legislation pertaining to COVID-19, known as the Corona Act.47 The regulation gives the FHI power to establish an electronic system for tracking COVID-19 infections.48 Participation in the system must be voluntary and must include “comprehensive, understandable, and easily accessible information, including on the processing of personal data.”49 III. Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  A. Smittestopp Voluntary COVID-19 Tracing App  On April 16, 2020, Norway introduced a mobile app, called Smittestopp (which means infection stop), to trace persons infected with COVID-19.50 Interest in the app was initially high, but usage has since waned. On April 17, 2020, close to a million users were reported as having downloaded the app.51 As of April 30, 2020, the Norwegian Public Health Agency (Folkehelseinstituttet, FHI) reported that about 900,000 Norwegians were actively using the app (about 20.5% of the population age 16 and above).52 On May 7, the FHI reported that they needed more users to use the app for it to work properly.53 As of May 19, 2020, the FHI reported that 641,824 users actively used the app.54 Most of the users are located in the Norwegian capital, Oslo, with about 100,000 users.55 Oslo has a population of about 680,000. As of May 20, 2020, no municipality had more than 20% of active Smittestopp app users.56   Smittestopp57 traces the movements of users with the explicit purpose of determining whether a user has been in close contact with another user who later developed COVID-19.58 “Close contact”                                                              46 Id. § 1.  47 Midlertidig lov om forskriftshjemmel for å avhjelpe konsekvenser av utbrudd av Covid-19 mv.

B. Supervisory Authority Investigation of the App  On April 27, 2020, Datatilsynet announced that it was about to launch an investigation into the use of the Smittestopp app because the central registration and collection of users’ location data may be an infringement of privacy.68 Datatilsynet, is the supervisory authority for the collection and use of personal data in Norway.69  It explained that the purpose of the investigation is to ensure that the app complies with the Norwegian regulation on tracing and epidemic contagion related to COVID-19.70 As noted above, the regulation requires that the system be voluntary and include “comprehensive, understandable and easily accessible information, including on the processing of personal data.”71                                                                59 Sammen kan vi knekke korona – last ned Smittestopp, Helse Norge, https://perma.cc/Z4XG-AL3Y.  60 Id.  61 Id.  62 Helse Norge, Informational Brochure on Smittestop App, https://perma.cc/8JQE-KBBB. 63 Id.  64 Bruk av Smittestopp og personvern, FHI (Mar. 31, 2020), https://perma.cc/ESY4-6WJ8. 65 HelseNorge, supra note 59 66 Id; FHI, supra note 64. 67 Helse Norge, supra note 592.  68 Press Release, Datatilsynet, Starter kontroll av FHIs Smittestopp-app (Apr. 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/87XW-SYDH.  69 Personal Information Act § 20.  70 Id. 71 § 2 FOR 2020-03-27-475.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Norway The Law Library of Congress 137 On May 12, 2020, Datatilsynet initiated the investigation.72 On May 20, 2020, it asked the FHI to provide additional information no later than June 1, 2020,73 on how the FHI has balanced the need for the app (presumably the public need for contact tracing during a pandemic) with the protection of users’ personal data.74 Datatilsynet noted in its press release that, “[i]f you do not have an overview of which personal data is used for what purpose, one cannot determine if it necessary to use that personal data to achieve each of these goals.”75  Following the announcement of the investigation, an expert group suggested improvements to the Smittestopp app, particularly the use of non-static Bluetooth IDs.76 The expert group also suggested using privacy differentiation for analytical purposes.77  C.  Privacy & and Other Critiques of the App In addition to the supervisory authority investigation mentioned above, concerns have also been raised internationally that the current design of the app is problematic in relation to the international framework for collecting personal data, even though using the app is voluntary. Specifically, the European Data Protection Board, which oversees compliance with the GDPR and the Data Protection Law Enforcement Directive, has voiced concerns that apps that collect and store information in the way the Norwegian app does violate those privacy protections.78 Another critique of the app is that it was launched too soon, before municipalities were ready to use it.79 As of May 10, 2020, only three municipalities had the technology available to send notification texts to their residents, Drammen, Tromsø, and Trondheim.80  Reportedly, as of May 16, no case had been discovered with the help of the app, as notifications of potential exposure was limited to users in these areas.81                                                                72 Datatilsynet, supra note 68; Varsel om pålegg til Smittestopp, Datatilsynet (May 12, 2020), perma.cc/9W9T-2CUS. 73 Etterspør mer informasjon om Smittestopp, Datatilsynet (May 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/NA8K-ZJHR.  74 Id.  75 Id.

Use of Telecommunication Data for Determining Travel Restriction Compliance   Norway implemented travel restrictions, both to and from the country as well as domestically within Norway, during the month of March 2020.83 The travel restrictions were coupled with monetary fines or prison of up to six months, including for persons breaching the domestic travel restrictions.84 Telecommunications data was used to measure compliance with these restrictions.85 Initial reports on how many Norwegians were present outside their home municipality were based on numerical data from the telecommunications systems,86 reporting the number of mobile users in a given area compared to the number of permanent residents, but there were no reports of people being individually targeted by that approach.87 Instead, as described by the telecommunications company Telenor, the data only provides information on how many mobile users are present in a given area (connected to a given cellular tower), not who or how close from each other they are.88                                                               82 Julie Kalveland, IT-ekspert bekymret for at Smittestopp-appen vil finne for få smittede, Dagens Medisin (Apr. 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/PX93-BPMR. 83 Press Release, Ministry of Justice and Public Security & Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Stricter Border controls Being Introduced – Norwegian Airports Not Closing (Mar. 15, 2020), https://perma.cc/KK6H-8E5C. For example, only Norwegian citizens and residents were allowed to enter the country, and the government asked all travelers to spend two weeks in quarantine following any international travel. In addition, Norwegians were also not allowed to travel to vacation properties outside their home municipality between March 16, 2020, and April 20, 2020.

A law enacted in 2004 determines that companies offering electronic communications networks and or services must guarantee the inviolability of communications. The preservation and transmission of traffic and location data relating to persons and legal entities, as well as related data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user, for the purposes of investigation, detection, and prosecution of serious crimes by the competent authorities is regulated by a law enacted in 2008.    Notwithstanding several legal measures taken to fight the pandemic, Portugal has yet to adopt electronic means to help in the fight against the spread of COVID-19.   I. Introduction  As of May 22, 2020, Portugal had registered 30,200 confirmed cases of COVID-19 and 1,289 related deaths.1 According to the National Authority of Communications (Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações, ANACOM), in 2019 Portugal had 12.4 million active cell phones in the country.2 However, Portugal has not yet developed a contact tracing app for the pandemic.    II.  Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   On April 26, 2016, the European Union issued the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of such data.3  To implement the GDPR into its domestic legislation,  Portugal enacted Law No. 58 of August 8, 2019, which regulates the processing of personal data carried out in the national territory, regardless of the public or private nature of the controller or the subcontractor, even if it is carried out in compliance with legal obligations or in pursuit of missions of public interest, applying all the exclusions provided for in article 2 of the GDPR.4 Under the GDPR the processing of personal data must comply with the principles of lawfulness, fairness and                                                  1 Ponto de Situação Atual em Portugal, Direção Geral de Saúde, https://covid19.min-saude.pt/ponto-de-situacao-atual-em-portugal/.   2 Serviços móveis – 2019, Autoridade Nacional de Comunicações, https://perma.cc/HPB9-CBFR.

Data Retention and Location Tracking  1.  Law No. 41 of August 18, 2004  Law No. 41 of August 18, 2004, transposed into domestic law the EU’s 2002 ePrivacy Directive on the processing of personal data and the protection of privacy in the electronic communications sector.6 Exceptions to the application of Law No. 41 that are strictly necessary for the protection of activities related to public security; defense; state security; and the prevention, investigation, and prosecution of criminal offenses are defined in special legislation.7  Companies offering electronic communications networks and/or services must guarantee the inviolability of communications and respective traffic data carried out through public communications networks and publicly available electronic communications services.8  The use of electronic communications networks for the storage of information or to obtain access to information stored in the terminal equipment of a subscriber or any user is only permitted when the following conditions are met:  a) Clear and complete information must be provided to the subscriber or user concerned, namely on the purposes of processing, in accordance with the provisions of the Personal Data Protection Law;  b) The subscriber or user has the right to refuse such processing.9  a.  Traffic Data  Traffic data relating to subscribers and users that is processed and stored by companies offering electronic communications networks and or services must be deleted or made anonymous when they are no longer needed for the purpose of transmitting the communication.10  Companies offering electronic communications services may process the data to the extent and for the time necessary for the commercialization of electronic communications services or the provision of value-added services, provided that the subscriber or user to whom the data refers has given prior consent, which can be withdrawn at any time.11                                                   5 GDPR art. 5.

Location Data  The processing of location data that relates to subscribers or users of public communications networks or publicly available electronic communications services is permitted only if the data is anonymized.12 Organizations with legal competence to receive emergency calls may register, process, and transmit location data for the purpose of responding to those calls.13 The processing of location data is also permitted to the extent and for the time necessary for the provision of value-added services, provided that prior consent is obtained from subscribers or users.14  Before obtaining such consent, companies offering electronic communications services to the public must inform users or subscribers about the type of location data that will be processed, the duration and purposes of the processing, and the eventual transmission of data to third parties for the purpose of providing value-added services.15 These companies must also guarantee subscribers and users the possibility, through simple and free means, to withdraw their consent for the processing of location data, and to temporarily refuse to authorize such processing “for each connection to the network or for each transmission of a communication.”16  The processing of location data must be limited to the employees and contractors of companies that offer electronic communications networks and/or services accessible to the public or third parties that provide value-added services, and must be restricted to what is necessary for the purposes of providing such service.17  2.  Law No. 32 of July 17, 2008  Law No. 32 of July 17, 2008, regulates the preservation and transmission of traffic and location data relating to persons and legal entities, as well as related data necessary to identify the subscriber or registered user, for the purposes of investigation, detection, and prosecution of serious crimes by the competent authorities. It transposes into national law the EU Data Retention Directive of 2006 on the conservation of data generated or processed in the context of the offer of communication services publicly available or public communications networks.18    The preservation of data that reveal the content of communications is prohibited without prejudice to the provisions of Law No. 41 of August 18, 2004, and criminal procedural legislation regarding the interception and recording of communications.19                                                      12 Id. art. 7(1). 13 Id. art. 7(2). 14 Id. art. 7(3). 15 Id. art. 7(4). 16 Id. art. 7(5). 17 Id. art. 7(6). 18 Lei No. 32/2008, de 17 de Julho, art. 1(1), https://perma.cc/T34T-CUVF.

Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  On March 13, 2020, the government enacted Decree-Law No. 10-A, which established exceptional and temporary measures associated with the epidemiological situation of COVID-19.20  The Decree-Law applies to the prevention, containment, mitigation, and treatment of COVID-19.21  Among other things, it suspended classes22 and travel,23 and limited access to spaces frequented by the public.24  Several other legal measures were taken by the government to fight the pandemic.  However, it seems that so far none of them have addressed electronic means to stop the spread of the virus.25 Nor has any entity developed a contact tracing app for Portugal.                                                       20 Decreto-Lei No. 10-A/2020, de 13 de Março, https://perma.cc/8TAX-SCQM.  21 Id. art. 1(2). 22 Id. art. 9. 23 Id. art. 11. 24 Id. arts. 12, 13. 25 Legislação Compilada – COVID-19, Diário da República Eletrônico, https://perma.cc/AP5T-BZS3.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 143 Russian Federation Peter Roudik Director of Legal Research   SUMMARY The Federal Government has adopted austerity measures to minimize the economic consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the right to apply specific measures aimed at enforcement of policies to combat the pandemic, including the employment of new technologies to monitor the community spread of COVID-19 and trace the contacts of infected people, has been given to the governors of the constituent components of the Russian Federation. Some regions have amended their provincial laws in order to ensure the legality of newly implemented policies. Most of the time, the use of technology has extended to tracing contacts, monitoring one’s location, and fining people for disobeying the isolation orders. Several regions have required the registration of the total population in order to obtain electronic Quick Response codes that serve as digital passes allowing individuals to leave their primary residences. Legal observers have noticed that these measures are not in line with Russian privacy and data protection legislation. As a follow-up to the pandemic, the Government introduced new federal legislation aimed at defining the legal regime for the forced quarantining of the population and building a nationwide population database.    I.  Introduction  According to information from Johns Hopkins University, on May 22, 2020, Russia officially reported around 326,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and 3,250 deaths from the infection.1 The infection was most widely spread in Moscow, St. Petersburg, and other major industrial cities in the center of the country. A full-scale nationwide quarantine was not introduced in Russia. In late March, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced the closure of nonessential businesses for one week and “asked the Russians to stay at home without outlining penalties for disregarding the request.”2   The national legislature adopted austerity measures aimed at fighting COVID-19. The legislative package mainly addressed economic difficulties of the pandemic experienced by individuals and territories. These measures included amendments to the federal budget, new fines for violation of quarantine rules and distribution of fake news about COVID-19, and other specific actions, for example, deferral of loan payments, postponement of state inspections for cars, increased sick leave coverage, a simplified procedure for applying for child subsidies, allowing the online purchase and delivery of medicines, and new rules for airfare refunds.3 However, the power to                                                  1 COVID-19 Dashboard by the Center for Systems Science and Engineering (CSSE), Johns Hopkins U.

Reportedly, 95.3 million out of the 144 million people living in Russia have smartphones.5  II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionThe right to privacy is incorporated in articles 23 and 24 of the Russian Constitution.6 Article 137 of the Criminal Code, entitled “Invasion of Personal Privacy,” provides for a monetary fine of up to RUB200,000 (approximately US$3,380) and up to two years of deprivation of liberty for the illegal collection or spreading of information about the private life of a person, without the person’s consent, where the information concerns personal or family secrets.7  Federal Law of the Russian Federation No. 152-FZ on Personal Data is the main legal act in the field of collecting, handling, and protecting information deemed personal.8  Under this Law, “any information directly or indirectly related to a physical person or that allows a physical person to be identified” is recognized as personal data.9 State and municipal authorities, legal entities, and individuals are required to obtain a person’s consent in order to process personal data.10   The Law does not include an exhaustive list of information that is considered personal. Some examples of what should be treated as personal information can be found in various implementing regulations. For example, Government Regulation No. 125 of March 4, 2010, on the List of Electronically Recorded Personal Data Included in Identification Documents, states that one’s passport or other ID number, personal name, date of birth, citizenship, gender, and digital photographic image constitute personal data.11   4 Robyn Dixon, In Russia, Facial Surveillance and Threat of Prison Being Used to Make Coronavirus Quarantines Stick, Wash. Post (Mar. 25, 2020), https://perma.cc/Y44A-4TGF.  5 By 2020, the Number of Russians with Smartphones Will Reach 95.3 Million, Gazeta.ru, Dec. 23, 2019, https://perma.cc/WQ4U-LHP3 (in Russian). 6 Konstitutsiia Rossiiskoi Federatsii [Constitution of the Russian Federation] Dec. 12, 1993 (in Russian), https://perma.cc/A5C7-HSJW. 7 Ugolovnyi Kodeks Rossiiskoi Federatsii [Criminal Code of the Russian Federation] No. 63-FZ, June 13, 1996, Sobranie Zakonodatel’stva Rossiiskoi Federatsii [SZRF] June 17, 1996, No. 25, item 2954, https://perma.cc/N8FX-NZJX (in Russian), https://perma.cc/43WT-78TJ (unofficial English translation). 8 Sobranie Zakonodatel’stva Rossiiskoi Federatsii [Collection of Russian Federation Legislation] (official gazette), 2006, No. 31(1), Item 3451, https://perma.cc/SX8U-ZJCV (in Russian). 9 Id. art. 3(1). 10 Id. arts. 6(1), 9. 11 Government Regulation No. 125 of Mar. 4, 2010, on the List of Electronically Recorded Personal Data Included in Identification Documents, Rossiiskaia Gazeta (official publication), Mar. 10, 2010, No. 48, https://perma.cc/4W52-GKTH (in Russian). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Russian Federation  The Law Library of Congress 145  It is not clear, however, if each separate component of this information is recognized as personal data or only in combination with other information if such a combination would allow an individual to be identified. Russian lawyers are generally of the opinion that a person’s name (first, middle, and last), date and place of birth, address, family and social status, education, profession, income, and other information may constitute personal data if this information or its combinations would allow an individual to be identified.12  Regarding other forms of identification, it appears that there is agreement among Russian lawyers that a computer IP address cannot be considered personal data because it does not allow a person to be directly identified. A person’s telephone number is viewed as personal data only if it is firmly associated with an individual through an agreement with a service provider.  Similar principles apply to the recognition of an individual’s email address as personal information.13    B.  Data Retention and Location Tracking  Every organization involved in processing personal data sets its own time frame and rules for handling personal data based on principles established by the Law and guidance issued by the Federal Service for Oversight in the Field of Communications and Information Technologies.14 The retention term is no less than six months for the messages and transmitted files, and no less than three years for information about the fact of communication.15    The Law established a general prohibition on taking any actions involving personal data without the consent of the data subject, except for a few specific situations when such consent may not be required. These may occur when personal data actions are necessary for any of the following purposes:   • To perform obligations under an international treaty, • To conduct judicial proceedings and ensure the enforcement of a judgment, • To secure legal rights and interests of third persons, • To perform the activities of government institutions, and • To protect the life, health, and other interests of the data subject if the subject’s consent cannot be obtained.16                                                    12 What Is Included in Personal Data and Under Which Conditions, 101 Million.com, https://perma.cc/W5Z8-EB7X. 13 Id. 14 Law on Personal Data, art. 5. 15 Federal Law No. 374 of July 6, 2016, on Amendments to the Federal Law on Countering Terrorism and Other Legislative Acts, Rossiiskaia Gazeta (official publication), July 8, 2016, https://perma.cc/SR95-SAUH (in Russian).  16  Law on Personal Data, arts. 7, 9. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Russian Federation  The Law Library of Congress 146 Tracking and identification of one’s geographic location by using electronic devices is not regulated by Russian legislation. This information is not included in article 10 of the Personal Data Law, which defines what information can be recognized as personal. A 2014 government regulation ordered provincial and municipal emergency services to develop tools that would allow the identification of the location of a person who calls for assistance in an emergency such as a fire or roadway traffic accident.17 In 2019, Russian legislators decided that geolocation information is information about services provided to customers by telecom operators. The new law protects the right of law enforcement to receive this information from mobile communications providers when a search for a missing child is conducted. Law enforcement authorities are required to receive judicial approval within 48 hours for the usage of geolocation information.18 Later, the legislature discussed a proposal to expand the right of police to use geolocation information in all search and rescue operations and allow the mobile phone users to transfer this information to third persons, however, this bill did not advance beyond the first reading.19 In 2016, a court found that when a telecom company shares with third persons information about its customers, including their geolocation information, it commits a violation of the licensing agreement.20     III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  The Russian health care system is based on a strong governmental role in ensuring the country’s sanitary and epidemiologic well-being. Combating epidemics and responding to emergencies are included in the joint jurisdiction of federal and provincial authorities.21 Government policy in the area of protection against medical emergencies is formulated in a number of federal and provincial legislative acts, presidential decrees, government regulations, and government programs. There is no special legislation aimed at the regulation of issues related to public health emergencies and epidemics. The outbreak of epidemics is considered an emergency situation, and depending on the outbreak’s severity, rules under a state of emergency may be declared.22  While the federal legislation was amended with provisions introducing criminal responsibility for violation of quarantine rules and stricter punishments for distribution of fake news about the pandemic, most of the measures for countering the pandemic were introduced by regional authorities. On March 23, 2020, the Prime Minister of Russia ordered the federal Ministry of Communications to develop, within the next three days, a guidance for regional authorities on how to build contact tracing systems based on transferring customers’ geolocation information                                                  17 Government of the Russian Federation, Regulation No. 2446 of Dec. 3, 2014, on Approving the Complex Development Program “Safe City,” Pravo.gov.ru (official publication), https://perma.cc/D73Q-7SBK (in Russian).  18 Federal Law No. 311 of Aug. 2, 2019, on Amending Article 8 of the Federal Law on Operational and Investigative Activities, Consultant+ database, https://perma.cc/Q92R-5SUJ.  19 The State Duma Adopted the  Bill on Using Geolocation In Search for Missing Persons, Tass.ru, Sept. 25, 2019, https://perma.cc/EVP2-YAWU.  20 Ruling of the Arbitration Appeals Court for the 9th Circuit No. 09AP-17574 of May 23, 2016, https://perma.cc/25R4-JRM9.  21 Constitution of the Russian Federation art. 72.  22  Federal Constitutional Law No. 3-FKZ of May 30, 2001, Legislationline.org, https://perma.cc/2MY4-KDTK. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Russian Federation  The Law Library of Congress 147 by mobile phone operators to regional authorities in charge of fighting COVID-19. Transportation employees became subject to additional control and extended contact tracing.23  The introduction of digital passes that would allow individuals to go outside of their residences and the consequent surveillance of people’s movements has turned out to be the most controversial point of the quarantine measures implemented. Most of the Russian regions required the self-isolated population to use tracking technology and install a system of downloadable matrix barcodes called Quick Response (QR) codes, which serve as digital passes. These QR codes are required to use public transportation. They are linked to prepaid transportation tickets, while individual public transit tickets usually available for purchase by cash at any point of sale were canceled.   As described in a Washington Post article, “as soon as the digital code is created on a cellphone, the clock is ticking. It allows three hours to shop at the nearest grocery store or pharmacy or to visit a doctor. One hour is allotted to walk the dog. Taking out the trash should take no more than 30 minutes. Street surveillance cameras are watching for anyone trying to skirt the rules.”24   A concern has been reported that these efforts will require “building up an entirely new huge database and then getting all people living in Moscow to provide their personal data to that database.”25    A separate app called Social Monitoring and built with the purpose of tracking patients who have tested positive for COVID-19 but were allowed to undergo treatment at home, as well as people who have been in contact with them, has been implemented in Moscow since April 3, 2020. A request to install the app is sent as a text message to all people identified as those who were in contact with an infected individual. The Deputy Mayor of Moscow has said this may include relatives, coworkers, passengers on a flight used by the infected person, cab drivers, couriers, etc.26 Reportedly, the Moscow City Government has an agreement with all Russian airlines operating international flights, and they share information with the authorities about all individuals arriving from abroad, including their phone numbers and addresses. Similar agreements exist with mobile services providers who report to the government instances when a customer uses a SIM card purchased abroad.27 The app is based on using the Global Positioning System (GPS) function for geolocation or the user’s network connections in order to determine his or her location if the GPS function is not available.28 The app monitors the location of the                                                  23 The Russian Federation Will Begin to Track by Phone Everyone Who Had Contact with Coronavirus Patients, Interfax, Mar. 23, 2020, https://perma.cc/LE5H-KND6.  24 Isabelle Khurshudyan, Coronavirus Is Testing the Limits of Russia’s Surveillance State, Wash.

If a person has not registered within 24 hours after being required to do so, has not responded to the request for identification within one hour, or has moved away from the location designated for the person’s isolation, the app reports the violation to the city authorities. If people refuse to install the app on their phones, they receive text messages with reminders during the first three days after an installation request is made, and then fines are issued. Individuals who have no smartphones receive special devices with a preinstalled Social Monitoring app.29   Confirming popular concerns about weak protection of data collected by government agencies, it was reported that the names and passport numbers of people fined for violation of the isolation rules can be found on the website for making fine payments by using ticket numbers. The city government stated that disclosure of this information does not constitute a violation of data protection rules. While lawyers disagree with this government position, they believe that individuals have no chance for remediation and compensation.30 Formally, government institutions can receive personal information from private companies under the court order only. Law enforcement may be allowed to have access to this information during investigative operations based on a special request. It appears that such information is shared most of the time regardless of the legal arrangements. Authorities also have information to all the personal data of individuals who have been registered on the web portal for state services because such a registration requires the customer’s consent for transfer of information to the third persons. Russian experts say that even when information includes nonpersonal data, there are possibilities for full identification of a person.31    Similar apps and monitoring systems were developed and established in other regions. All the regionally introduced systems are not connected with each other, and regional governments were free to select local solutions. For example, in the largest East Siberian region, employers and self-employed individuals are supposed to send requests for passes by email to the regional digital development agency and then receive codes through text messages after verification of the requester’s identification through the database of residents registered at the regional web portal for state services. Reasons for pass requests are, for example, visiting relatives, traveling to summer homes in the country, meeting with an attorney or a notary, and accompanying minors, among other things. Each pass is valid for two 60-minute trips. 32 In another region, the local administration partnered with a regional bank in which the regional government is a major stakeholder and asked all residents applying for the digital passes to consent to the processing of their personal information by the bank.33                                                  29 Bela Liauw & Valery Kodachigov, Social Monitoring Users Were Fined More Than 200 Million Rubles, Vedomosti, May 20, 2020, https://perma.cc/5S55-KKXN. 30 Open Access to Passport Data of Muscovites Fined for Violation of Isolation Rules, Newsru.com, May 18, 2020, https://perma.cc/2VTZ-TCAF (in Russian).  31 Kozlova, supra note 27.  32 Anna Vilisova & Ilya Shevelev, Digital Pass Systems Are Being Introduced Throughout Russia.

They are concerned that mobile applications require access to sound, video, pictures, and records of movements stored in the phones.34    The implementation of these measures met with two major problems: the difficulties of actual enforcement and technical glitches in computer systems. It was reported that 60,000 people in the city of Moscow installed the Social Monitoring app on their smartphones. About 54,000 fines were issued to about one-third of those who were under surveillance.  Some people were fined several times. People complain that they are fined for not sending a selfie on time or when the GPS erroneously shows that a person has left his or her residence. About 400 people were fined for not responding to self-identification requests received at nighttime. Later, the nighttime self-identification requests were terminated and fines were canceled. The city government allows a person to dispute a fine but the procedure is reportedly long and complicated. Each person who allegedly violates the house quarantine rules is fined in the amount of RUB4,000 (approximately US$70) under the city law.35 While federal legislation provides for 10 times higher fines for approximately the same violations, it is the regional laws, which were quickly amended with detailed norms regulating the behavior of different categories of the population during the pandemic,36 that are enforced.37   IV.  Related Legislative Developments  On May 21, 2020, Russian media reported that the upper chamber of the legislature discussed a bill that would amend the Federal Law on Protection of People and Territories in Emergency Situations, which would define the regime of self-isolation and allow federal and regional authorities to impose varied restrictions on individuals’ rights. Presently, Russian law differentiates between an emergency situation and a state of emergency. The Law on Emergency Situations emphasizes that additional measures undertaken by government authorities to mitigate the consequences of the emergency cannot restrict the rights and freedoms of people. These rights, specifically the right to free movement, were limited by isolation rules recently imposed by regional governments to fight the pandemic. These regional measures appeared to be in contradiction with federal legislation. The amendment appears to be able to bring the practice in line with legislation and create legal grounds for restriction of rights in the future.38   Also, a new Federal Law on Unified Federal Information Registry was passed by the legislature on May 21, 2020. The Law provides for the creation of a single comprehensive database run by                                                  34 Id. 35 Liauw & Kodachigov, supra note 29.  36 See, for example, City of Moscow Law No. 6 of Apr. 1, 2020 on Amending Select Legislative Acts of the City of Moscow, Mos.ru, https://perma.cc/K976-XJJS.  37 Denis Dmitriev, Sobyanin and Putin Introduced Different Fines for Self-Isolation Violations, Meduza.io, Apr. 4, 2020, https://perma.cc/929Z-XZS6.  38 Russia Wants to Pass a Law on Forced “Self-Isolation” Giving the Authorities the Right to Restrict the Freedoms of Citizens, Newsru.com, May 21, 2020, https://perma.cc/K264-QZ5J.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Russian Federation  The Law Library of Congress 150 the National Tax Service that would collect data on all Russian citizens and residents and keep records of their personal life.

The application of data protection regulations in health emergencies allows the data controller to adopt decisions necessary to protect the vital interests of individuals while safeguarding essential interests in the field of public health. Under the state of alarm, the government is empowered to take all measures necessary to protect the health and safety of citizens and strengthen the public health system, in addition to preventing and containing the virus and mitigating the health, social, and economic impacts. The Ley General de Sanidad also empowers health authorities, in epidemic situations, to establish extreme measures to protect public and individual health. Among these measures, the National Institute of Statistics has developed an app called ”DataCovid,” which is based on data provided by the main telecommunications operators. It uses positioning data from mobile devices, anonymized and aggregated, guaranteeing strict compliance with data protection standards.   I. Introduction  Spain declared a state of alarm due to COVID-19 on March 14, 2020.1 A mandatory lockdown was imposed, and it has been extended several times since then, the latest being an extension through May 24, 2020 (although gradual easing of restrictions began in early May).2    Spain has 47 million residents. Under the lockdown, people were allowed out only to go to work, shop for groceries, seek medical care, and briefly walk their dog.  As of May 21, 2020, there were 233,037 COVID-19 cases in the country, and 27,940 persons had died.3                                                    1 Real Decreto 463/2020, de 14 de marzo, por el que Se Declara el Estado de Alarma para la Gestión de la Situación de Crisis Sanitaria Ocasionada por el COVID-19, Boletin Oficial del Estado [B.O.E.] Mar. 14, 2020, https://perma.cc/4WL5-NK2T.  2 Real Decreto 514/2020, de 8 de mayo, por el que se Prorroga el Estado de Alarma Declarado por el Real Decreto 463/2020, de 14 de marzo, por el que se Declara el Estado de Alarma para la Gestión de la Situación de Crisis Sanitaria Ocasionada por el COVID-19, B.O.E.

Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionOn March 12, 2020, the Agencia Espanola de Protección de Datos (AEPD) released a legal advisory report on measures affecting data privacy because of the COVID-19 emergency.6  The report states that EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)7 and Organic Law 3/2018 of December 5 (LPDP) on the Protection of Personal Data and Guarantee of Digital Rights (LOPDGDD)8 constitute the legal framework applicable in the current COVID-19 emergency situation.  The GDPR allows data controllers to process personal data during health emergencies in a manner that protects the vital interests of individuals while safeguarding essential interests in the field of public health.9  In this regard, recital 54 of the GDPR provides that the processing of special categories of personal data, without the consent of the data subject, may be necessary for reasons of public interest in the field of public health. Such processing must be subject to appropriate and specific measures in order to protect persons’ rights and freedoms. This processing of health-related data for reasons of public interest should not result in third parties, such as employers, insurance companies, or banks, using personal data for other purposes.10  4 Adrian Raya, Todos los Moviles de Espana Seran Rastreados Durante Ocho Dias, Espanol, Oct. 29, 2019, https://perma.cc/E585-HXYK. 5  Santiago Millán Alonzo, Oliver Wyman: “Los Espanoles Son los más Dispuestos a Dar sus Datos para las Apps Frente al Covid-19,” Cinco Días, Apr. 15, 2020, https://perma.cc/8J32-QJJ8. 6 AEPD, Informe 017/2020 on the Treatment of Data Derived from the Present COVID-19 Virus Situation (Mar. 12, 2020), https://perma.cc/Z8GA-655Y. 7 Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016 on the Protection of Natural Persons with Regard to the Processing of Personal Data and on the Free Movement of Such Data, and Repealing Directive 95/46/EC (General Data Protection Regulation) [GDPR], 2016 O.J.

To do this, the AEPDP is assisting health authorities, providing them with criteria that make these aims compatible.15  The AEPDP has established the criteria that must be applied for the processing of personal data under the current circumstances.16 The data processed under this emergency may only be used for control of an epidemic, such as public agencies using information on the use of self-assessment applications, or geolocation data being used to create maps of areas of greater or lesser risk.17   The data so accessed and used must be limited to what the competent public authorities consider necessary to fulfill the goal of epidemic management and control.18 Data may only be collected from those who are over 16 years of age, unless authorization of parents or legal representatives is received.19                                                   11 AEPD, supra note 6, at 7; GDPR art. 5. 12 AEPD, supra note 6, at 7. 13 Comunicado de la AEPD Sobre Apps y Webs de Autoevaluación del Coronavirus, AEPD (Mar. 26, 2020), https://perma.cc/LAX3-6WTS. 14 Id. 15 Id. 16 Id. 17 Id. 18 Id. 19 Id. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Spain The Law Library of Congress 154 Under Orden SND/297/2020, the National Institute of Statistics (INE) is responsible for the processing of data and reporting on the movement of people during confinement, guaranteeing statistical secrecy and compliance with data privacy requirements. 20  B. Location Tracking  Organic Law 4/1981 on the State of Alarm, Exception, and Siege allows exceptional measures restricting the full enjoyment of certain rights and freedoms in cases of epidemics and health emergencies.21 Among others, these measures include restricting the movement of people or vehicles at specific times and places, or requiring them to fulfill certain conditions.22    Applying the state of alarm provisions of LO 4/1981, Real Decreto 463/2020 empowers the Ministries of Health, Defense, Interior and Transportation, Mobility and Urban Agenda to take all necessary measures to protect the health and safety of citizens, contain the progression of the disease and strengthen the public health system, in addition to preventing and containing the virus and mitigating the health, social, and economic impacts.23 These measures include the issuance of orders, resolutions, provisions and instructions necessary to guarantee the provision of all services, ordinary or extraordinary, to protect people, property and places, under the authority granted within the state of alarm declaration in compliance with article 11 of LO 4/1981.24   In addition, Organic Law 3/1986 of April 14, on Special Measures in the Field of Public Health, provides that health authorities may adopt measures specified in this Law when necessary to protect public health.25 These measures are directed at illness detection, treatment, hospitalization, and control when confronting a risk to public health.26  In order to control communicable diseases, health authorities, in addition to carrying out general preventive actions, may adopt appropriate measures for the control of patients and people who are or have been in contact with them and their environment, as well as those deemed necessary in the event of a transmissible risk.27                                                  20 INE, Análisis de la Movilidad de la Población Durante el Estado de Alarma por COVID-19 a Partir de la Posición de los Teléfonos Móviles (Mar. 2020), https://perma.cc/3YJM-Y349, and Orden SND/297/2020, por la que se Encomienda a la Secretaría de Estado de Digitalización e Inteligencia Artificial, del Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital, el Desarrollo de Diversas Actuaciones para la Gestión de la Crisis Sanitaria Ocasionada por el COVID-19 art. 2, para. 3, B.O.E.

Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  The Ministerio de Asuntos Económicos y Transformación Digital has been working on new mobility analysis tools to support the fight against COVID-19. All data collected in an aggregated and anonymous manner by the INE has been made available to the governments of the Autonomous Communities.33 In addition, some information prepared by the INE, and by the Ministerio de Transporte, Mobilidad y Agenda Urbana, is now available on their websites.34   Mobile phone location data is used to track people’s movements and verify how closely a nationwide lockdown is being respected.35 Information will enable verification that users’ area of residence match their actual location, thus enabling measurement of compliance with containment measures.36  The app, called ”DataCovid“ and managed by INE, is based on data provided by the main telecommunications operators.37 Data received from these operators does not include personal                                                  28 Ley General de Sanidad art. 26, B.O.E.

The country has wide smartphone possession and a high rate of mobile internet use, with 75% of the population using the internet and 89% of internet users 16 to 64 years of age owning a smartphone in 2019. The Turkish Ministry of Health employs electronic systems implemented via mobile applications to inform the populace of the risks, track the spread of the virus, and implement isolation measures. To date, the Ministry of Health has launched two mobile applications; one primarily for warning users when they approach areas with a high risk of infection and preventing high-risk individuals from using public vehicles for intercity travel, and the other for assigning positive cases and their possible contacts to members of contact tracing teams. Personal health data collected by these applications appear to be processed under a special rule allowing sensitive health data to be processed without the explicit consent of data subjects for purposes of the protection of public health.     In Turkish law, the general personal data protection framework is set by the Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LPPD). The Turkish personal data protection framework is largely harmonized with EU data protection law, albeit there exist certain divergences. In the electronic communications sector, the retention of traffic data, including certain categories of personal data, and the processing of location data by service providers are governed by the Regulation on the Processing and Protection of the Privacy of Personal Data in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECommDPR). The ECommDPR allows the use of location data without the consent of the data subject in cases of disasters, emergencies, and emergency calls.   I. Introduction  According to the Turkish Ministry of Health, by May 22, 2020, Turkey had 154,500 cases of COVID-19 and 4,276 COVID-19 related deaths with 116,100 patients recovered and 1.77 million tests administered; 800 patients remained in ICUs, of which 401 were intubated.1 Turkey was ninth in the list of countries with the most COVID-19 cases on May 22nd, according to the John Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.2  In response to the outbreak, the Turkish government has deployed an array of electronic measures aimed at informing the populace of the risks, tracking the spread of the virus, and implementing isolation measures. These measures are mainly implemented with mobile applications running on smartphones or tablet computers, which citizens can install on their                                                  1 COVID-19 Situation Report, Turkish Ministry of Health (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/4PDQ-WMRR (in Turkish). 2 COVID-19 Dashboard, John Hopkins U.

The Ministry of Health appears to process the personal data collected though these applications under a public health related exception regime that exists under the Turkish personal data protection framework. Turkey has wide smartphone possession and a high rate of mobile internet use. According to data released by the Turkish Statistical Institute, 98.7% of households in Turkey had a mobile phone (including smartphones) in 2019, with 88.3% of households having internet access and 75.3% of the population using the internet.3 According to the Digital 2020 report published by We Are Social, a UK-based digital marketing agency, of the 62.07 million internet users in Turkey74% of the population58.23 million (93.8%) were also mobile internet users.4 The report found that 74.8% of web traffic (websites served to web browsers) is attributable to mobile phone use, and 89% of internet users 16 to 64 years of age own a smartphone.5 II. Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionArticle 20 of the Constitution of Turkey enshrines a person’s right to protection of his or her privacy and personal data, providing that “[p]ersonal data can be processed only in cases envisaged by law or by the person’s explicit consent.”6 Turkish personal data protection law is largely harmonized with the European Union’s data protection framework. The main national legal framework that provides the general rules and principles of personal data protection in Turkish law is set forth in the Law on the Protection of Personal Data (LPPD) and the various relevant secondary legislation that governs certain aspects of personal data protection law such as the processing of personal health data, the protection of personal data in electronic communications, and the erasure, destruction, or anonymization of personal data.7 These are complemented by personal data protection statutes in numerous laws that regulate the provision of services in the public and private sectors. The protection of privacy and personal data in the electronic communications sector is governed by the Regulation on the Processing and Protection of the Privacy of Personal Data in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECommDPR).8 3 TurkStat, Availability of Devices in Households, 2004-2019, https://perma.cc/MK2Z-74VA; TurkStat, Information Society Statistics, 2004-2019, https://perma.cc/4XM2-BRAN.  4 Simon Kemp, Digital 2020: Turkey, We Are Social (Feb. 18, 2020), https://perma.cc/NF3B-9BBL.  5 Id. 6 Constitution of Turkey, Law No. 4121, as amended, art. 20, https://perma.cc/4EEX-3DM8 (in English). 7 Law on the Protection of Personal Data, Law No. 6698, Official Gazette No. 29677 (Apr. 7, 2016), https://perma.cc/EWS6-NN77 (unofficial English translation); Regulation on Personal Health Data, Official Gazette No. 30808, (June 21, 2019), https://perma.cc/7GX5-457G (in Turkish); Regulation on the Processing and Protection of the Privacy of Personal Data in the Electronic Communications Sector (ECommDPR), Official Gazette No. 28363 (July 24, 2012), https://perma.cc/ZL5E-38RL (in Turkish); Regulation on the Erasure, Destruction, or Anonymization of Personal Data, Official Gazette No. 30224 (Sept. 28, 2017), https://perma.cc/JY8Z-DBPG (in Turkish).  8 ECommDPR, supra note 7. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 160  1.  Law on the Protection of Personal Data  The LPPD sets forth the principles that govern the processing of personal data, providing that any processing of data must be done in conformity with the law and in good faith, that the data must be accurate and up to date, that the data must be processed for a specified, explicit, and legitimate purpose and the processing must be relevant, limited, and proportionate to the purposes of processing, and that the data must be stored only for the duration that is necessitated by law or by the purpose for which the data was collected.9 The LPPD sets forth the explicit consent of the data subject as the principal condition for the processing of personal data, and provides an additional list of conditions under which personal data may be processed without the explicit consent of the data subject.10    Similar to the scheme under EU law, the LPPD applies a special protection regime to ”special categories of personal data,” namely, data relating to “race, ethnic origin, political opinions, philosophical beliefs, religion, sect or other beliefs, appearance and dressing, membership of association, foundation or trade-union, health, sexual life, criminal conviction and security measures, and biometrics and genetics.”11 These categories of personal data, except data relating to health and sexual life, may be processed without the explicit consent of the data subject only if prescribed by law.12 On the other hand, according to the exception regime provided under article 6(3) of the LPPD, data relating to health and sexual life may only be processed without explicit consent “for purposes of protection of public health, operation of preventive medicine, medical diagnosis, treatment, and care services, planning and management of health services and financing by persons under the obligation of secrecy or authorized institutions and organizations.”13 Personal data processed in accordance with the law must be erased, destroyed, or anonymized ex officio by the data controller or upon request from the data subject when the reasons necessitating the processing cease to exist.14 The rules and principles that govern the erasure, destruction, and anonymization process are provided in a regulation and guidelines issued by the Turkish Data Protection Authority (DPA).15  2. Regulation of Personal Data Processing and Privacy in the Electronic Communications Sector  The ECommDPR governs the specialized personal data protection regime that electronic communications service providers operating under the Law on Electronic Communications (LEC) must comply with.16 The ECommDPR sets forth rules regarding the management of data                                                  9 LPPD art. 4(2). 10 Id. art. 5.  11 Id. art. 6(1). 12 Id. art. 6(3). 13 Id. 14 Id. art. 7(1). 15 Regulation on the Erasure, Destruction, or Anonymization of Personal Data, supra note 7. 16 Law on Electronic Communications, Law No. 5809, Official Gazette No. 27050 (Nov. 10, 2008), https://perma.cc/P4K3-NQSJ (in Turkish). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 161 safety, notification of risks and data breaches to data subjects, the processing and retention of data, including traffic data and location data, and certain privacy services that electronic communication service providers must provide to their customers.17   The ECommDPR prohibits the listening, tapping, storage, termination, or surveillance of communication without the consent of all parties to the communication, except in cases prescribed by law or in accordance with a court decision.18 Moreover, service providers may not process traffic data, defined as “data processed for the purpose of the conveyance of a communication on an electronic communications network or for the billing thereof,” for purposes that are not within the scope of the services they provide.19 Traffic data may be processed by service providers only for purposes such as traffic management, interconnection, billing, fraud prevention, and dispute resolution.20 ECommDPR provides the purposes for which certain categories of traffic data may be retained by service providers and prescribes the mandatory retention duration of certain traffic data.   B. Data Retention and Location Tracking  1.  Data Retention  According to article 4(2)(d) of the LPPD, personal data may be retained for no longer than is provided in special laws or is necessary for the purposes for which the personal data are processed. Rules regarding the retention of personal data processed in the context of the provision of electronic communications are provided in the ECommDPR and based on the authority delegated by article 51 of the LEC, which is the special law regulating the electronic communications sector.   The ECommDPR provides a list of categories of data that electronic communications service providers are required to retain; the categories fall under data necessary for the following purposes: to trace and identify the source of a communication, to identify the destination of a communication, to identify the date, time, and duration of a communication, to identify the type of communication, to identify users’ communication equipment or what purports to be their equipment, and to identify the location of mobile communication equipment. Service providers are required to retain this data for one year from the date the communication occurred, and for three months for calls that are not connected.21 The retained data must be stored in Turkey, and it must be destroyed or anonymized within one month after the date on which the mandated retention period ends.   Additionally, the ECommDPR requires service providers to retain personal data related to criminal investigations, inspections, audits, and disputes until the relevant process has ended,                                                  17 ECommDPR arts. 5, 6, 8-15, and 17-20, respectively. 18 ECommDPR art. 7(1). 19 Id. art. 8(1). 20 Id. art. 8(2). 21 Id. art. 14(1). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 162 and retain records regarding access to personal data and relevant systems for four years. Service providers must also retain records on the consent provided by the users regarding the processing of their personal data at least until the subscription of the user is terminated.  2.  Location Tracking  The LEC and the ECommDPR echo the same principle set forth in the EU ePrivacy Directive concerning the processing of location data,22 providing that location data may only be processed if it is made anonymous, or with the consent of the users or subscribers to the extent and for the duration necessary for the provision of a value-added electronic communication service.23 Location data is defined as “data processed in an electronic communications network or via an electronic communications service, indicating the geographical position of the terminal equipment of a user.”24 The ECommDPR further provides that service providers must offer users means to temporarily disallow the use of location data (data that is not traffic data), and means to withdraw their consent for the use of location data easily, immediately, and free of charge.25 ECommDPR also provides for an exception to the consent rule, stipulating that location data may be processed without the consent of the user only “in cases of disasters, emergency, or in the context of emergency calls.”26   III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  In response to the need for employing technological solutions to track and limit the spread of COVID-19, the Turkish Ministry of Health has launched several projects incorporating mobile applications that run on smartphones or tablet computers. These projects are complemented by the regular Turkish public digital health data management platform called E-Nabız (E-Pulse). Also, the DPA has issued two guidelines specific to the processing of personal data by the Ministry of Health and authorized institutions within the context of public health measures deployed to counter the outbreak.  A.  Guidelines of the Turkish Data Protection Authority  The DPA issued two guidance statements relevant to electronic measures that could be deployed to fight the COVID-19 outbreak. On March 27, 2020, the DPA issued guidance on the processing of personal data, especially health data, in the context of the COVID-19 outbreak.27 The DPA noted that employers were authorized to share the relevant personal data of persons who contracted COVID-19 with public authorities based on article 8 of the LPPD, which authorizes                                                  22 Consolidated Version of the Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (ePrivacy Directive), 2002 O.J. (L 201) 37, https://perma.cc/YHA5-EFXV. 23 LEC art. 51(8); ECommDPR art. 11(1). 24 ECommDPR art. 3(1)(j). 25 Id. art. 11(1) and (2). 26 Id. art. 11(3). 27 Turkish Data Protection Authority, On Protection of Personal Data During the Fight Against COVID-19 (Mar. 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/42BX-U6JM (in English). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Turkey The Law Library of Congress 163 the transfer of health data for purposes of the protection of public health.28 The statement further explained that the LPPD would not apply to the processing of health data by the Ministry of Health and other public institutions for the purposes of fighting the outbreak, citing the derogation stipulated in article 28(1)(ç) providing that the LPPD will not apply to the “[p]rocessing of personal data within the scope of preventive, protective and intelligence-related activities by public institutions and organizations who are assigned and authorized for providing national defence, national security, public safety, public order or economic safety.”  The DPA issued a second guidance issued on April 9, 2020, regarding the use of location data in connection with COVID-19 measures.29 The DPA explained that location data, as defined in ECommDPR, is a type of personal data that would normally be protected under the LPPD. However, the DPA reiterated its position that the processing of data by the Ministry of Health and other public institutions and persons authorized by law for the purpose of fighting the outbreak would fall under the article 28(1)(ç) derogation of the LPPD, thus concluding that public institutions could process location data under the derogation as well. The DPA reiterated that although such processing would be within the scope of the derogation, the institutions and persons undertaking such processing must take all technical and administrative measures necessary to ensure the security and privacy of the data and must erase or destroy the data once the reasons necessitating the processing cease to exist.  B.  Electronic Measures Deployed by the Ministry of Health Against the COVID-19 Outbreak  Before the outbreak, the Turkish public health system already employed an extensive electronic health data management system called Sağlık-NET, with patient access to the system provided via the online portal E-Nabız.30 The use of this portal is voluntary; users sign up to the system with their names and Turkish ID numbers and may access the system via website or mobile application. The Ministry of Health requires all healthcare providers to upload patients’ medical test results, diagnoses, and prescriptions to the centralized system, and the data remain in storage with the Ministry of Health without being anonymized, which has caused concerns among numerous commentators, including the Turkish Medical Association.31 Patients can view their health data uploaded in the system through their E-Nabız accounts, and they have some control over the extent of access that healthcare providers have to the data, by giving or withholding consent electronically on the platform.32 The Regulation on Personal Health Data provides standard rules for the access of healthcare providers to the health data of patients who                                                  28 LPPD art. 8(2), by reference to LPPD art. 6(3). 29 Covid-19 ile mücadelede konum verisinin işlenmesi ve kişilerin hareketliliklerinin izlenmesi hakkinda bilinmesi gerekenler, Turkish Data Protection Authority (Apr. 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/KD38-E3AL. 30 Gov’t of Turkey, About e-Nabız, https://perma.cc/W6RF-EKMB (in English).

On April 8, 2020, the Ministry of Health launched the ”Pandemic Isolation Tracking Project” (Pandemi İzolasyon Takip Projesi—PITP).35 The PITP incorporates the mobile application ”Life Fits Home” (Hayat Eve Sığar), which users can download.36 The application collects health data from users who voluntarily respond to questions about their age, how they feel physically, whether they are experiencing symptoms, and whether they have preexisting medical conditions. This information is then used for assigning a risk factor to the user and populating an epidemic heat map that can be viewed by application users, if the user shares his or her location data with the application. Users may also track the risk status and location of their consenting family members by adding them to their profile. The application warns the user if he or she, or a family member who was added to the profile, enters a high-risk zone. The application shows the user the nearest essential facilities such as hospitals, pharmacies, markets, and public transportation on a map.37  The application incorporates a module for creating a 10 or 12 digit code that includes information regarding the user’s infection risk status. On May 30, 2020, the Ministry of Internal Affairs issued a circular ordering the use of the code, called a “HES code,” for purchases of all intercity and international travel tickets on public modes of transportation, including air travel.38 Travelers will not be allowed by operators on public transportation vehicles if their HES codes indicate that they were diagnosed as positive, or they have been in contact with a person diagnosed as such.39 Moreover, the system will warn passengers who have been in a public transportation vehicle in the last 14 days with a person who was not indicated to be at risk by their HES code at the time of travel but has later been determined to be at risk.40 Persons who are issued Turkish ID numbers can obtain HES codes via the Life Fits Home mobile application, through Turkey’s general e-                                                 33 Regulation on Personal Health Data, supra note 7, art. 6. 34 Bariş Gündoğan, Koronavirüs testi yaptıranlar sonuçlara 'eNabız'dan ulaşabilecek, Anadolu Agency (Mar. 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/4LD8-WF2K. 35 Pandemi İzolasyon Takip Projesi nedir: Covid-19 salgını kapsamında nasıl kullanılacak?, BBC News Turkey (Apr. 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/XDE7-6C6Q.  36 Hayat Eve Sığar uygulaması nasıl indirilir?

This application works with the Ministry’s ”Transmission and Isolation Tracking System” (Filyasyon ve İzolasyon Takip Sistemi—FITAS). Through the application, members of contact tracing teams can access the contact information of patients who are assigned to them (persons who have tested positive, or are reported to have had contact with a positive case) to reach these persons to administer tests and inquire about their previous movements and contacts.46  Significantly, the privacy policies of both mobile applications state that the Ministry of Health processes the data collected via the applications under the exception for the processing of special categories of personal data provided in article 6(3) of the LPPD, which authorizes the use of health data by authorized institutions without the explicit consent of data subjects for purposes of, among other things, protection of public health, medical diagnosis, treatment, or care services.47 A press release issued by the Directorate of Communications of the Presidency of Turkey confirmed that the government viewed the data collection and processing for purposes of the                                                  41 How to Get HES Code?, Turkish Ministry of Health Hayat Eve Sığar Info.

Alternatively, it had available the article 176 constitutional authorities of the Supreme National Security Council to manage the crisis as a national security and defense matter under the leadership of the President, the ministers, and other key governmental and defense figures, within the limits provided by the Supreme Leader and through decisions authorized by him, and this is the management path it chose.    The Supreme National Security Council established the National Headquarters to Combat Corona in February 2020, which is directing the country’s efforts against COVID-19 under the direct leadership of the Minister of Health and Medical Education, and has implemented various other measures including applications and websites for voluntary registration, self-assessments, prevention and statistical information, medical assistance, and infection risk notifications. Many of these measures have become contentious due to the arguable infringement of people’s rights to privacy and data protection under Iranian law, which is discussed in this report. The information provided is based on Iranian legislation, public measures, news sources, and other publicly available information.   I. Introduction  As of May 22, 2020, the Iranian government had announced a total of 131,652 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 7,300 deaths; 102,276 recoveries; and 2,659 patients currently in critical condition.1 The World Health Organization’s May 22 report on Iran indicated 129,341 total confirmed cases and 7,249 deaths.2    Iranian government officials, including the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, have repeatedly prompted people through text messaging and other methods to participate in providing information by registering with the approved self-assessment applications and websites or to call or respond to calls from dedicated phone numbers. In an attempt to encourage people’s trust to engage with providing their information, the Ministry of Health published its privacy policy, indicating that the Ministry is strictly protective of all individuals’ privacy and                                                  1 AC19 Official Coronavirus Daily Reports and Registration Page (website as viewed on May 22, 2020), https://ac19.ir/; 2,311 New COVID-19 Cases; National Death Toll Reaches 7,300, Ministry of Health and Medical Education (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/8U5N-736Y (all sources are in Farsi unless otherwise noted) .   2 Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Situation Report 123, World Health Organization (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/YN6N-GJ86 (in English). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Iran The Law Library of Congress 168 personal data, in compliance with the 2017 Decree of the Supreme Administrative Council Concerning the Charter on Citizens’ Rights in the Administrative Systems.3    Iranian government officials have reportedly expressed satisfaction with people’s response to the combination of electronic self-assessments, telephone and in-person medical reviews, and the COVID-19 tests. On April 21, 2020, the Deputy Minister of Health and Medical Education indicated that this combination has provided the government with the COVID-19-related information of over 70 million people (the total Iranian population numbers approx. 84 million).4 On May 3, 2020, the Iranian President made a general statement during an official meeting with the Supreme Leader and the National Headquarters for Combating Corona that roughly 83% of the Iranian population has followed government requests and guidelines for combating the spread of the coronavirus.5   II. Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   Pursuant to the Iranian Constitution, statutes, and regulations, people’s dignity, life, property, rights, domicile, and occupation must not be violated, unless sanctioned by law. Although Iran has not passed comprehensive legislation dedicated entirely to privacy rights and data protection, the right to privacy and data protection has been emphasized in various pieces of legislation and in the Constitution. The law holds as private and protected every individual’s private assets, body, character, and places, whether tangible or virtual, where a person can have a reasonable expectation of privacy. This includes personal documents, mail, phones, computers, telephone conversations, and all other data transmitted in a private manner in cyberspace that could be traceable to that individual, such as all personally identifiable information (e.g., an individual’s name, home and work addresses, bank accounts) and sensitive personal data (e.g., information concerning family matters, criminal records, tribal or ethnic origins, moral and religious beliefs, ethical characteristics, sexual habits, genetics, health status, and physical or psychological status).6                                                    3 Privacy Policy Statement, Ministry of Health and Medical Education, https://perma.cc/F2EJ-P8K4; Decree of the Supreme Administrative Council Concerning the Charter on Citizens’ Rights in the Administrative Systems, Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Apr. 10, 2017, No. 20995, https://perma.cc/HYL4-ST89. 4 Evaluating Latest Corona Situation with Attendance of Government Officials at Health Commission [Meeting], Parliament News Agency (Apr. 21, 2020), https://perma.cc/ZUM6-DEEL; Details of Ministry of Health Mandates for Corona, Islamic Republic News Agency (Mar. 3, 2020), https://perma.cc/HSP6-FSDW.  5 83% of People Have Complied with Health Regulations, Presidential News Center (May 3, 2020), https://perma.cc/J7Q2-5QQ8. 6 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran 1979, as amended, arts. 22, 25, https://perma.cc/JN9G-4QUV, English translation, https://perma.cc/3CGR-CNRF; Law on Respect for Legitimate Freedoms and Citizens Rights, May 5, 2004, § 8, https://perma.cc/HA44-RJSN; Electronic Commerce Law, Jan. 7, 2004, arts. 1–5, 11, 33–35, 38, 58–60, 71–72, 79, https://perma.cc/U72P-XFF9 (English translation); Cybercrime Act, Dec. 24, 2009, arts. 1, 2, 5, 25, 32, 34, 38, 39, 48, https://perma.cc/723P-9WNU; General Policies for “Security of Production Space and Information Exchange and Communication (Afta),” Feb. 18, 2011, § 1, https://perma.cc/NF7Z-DLDV; Law on the Release and Freedom of Information, Aug. 22, 2009, arts. 13–15, https://perma.cc/M7T4-3PKM; Criminal Procedure Code of Iran 1392 [2014], arts. 4, 40, 150, https://perma.cc/D83H-NQZ8; Law on \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Iran The Law Library of Congress 169  Hence, all forms of access and investigation of the aforementioned items or materials, whether for the purpose of searching, collecting, processing, analyzing, using, storing, or sharing it, are generally legally forbidden regardless of whether the intention is good or bad, unless access or inspection is allowed either by informed, express, and written consent of the individual, according to a subject-specific law or regulation, or by a legal order. For example, in ta’zir offenses of the fifth to eighth degrees, the court may, with the offender’s consent, put the offender under the supervision of an electronic system within a specific area.7   Any legal access or investigation based on an individual’s informed consent, other laws, or legal orders must be performed within a legally defined scope and is subject to certain requirements. Among others, those requirements include  • consideration for the individual’s dignity,  • an adequately secure information system,8  • a clear statement of the purpose of access,  • a scope limited to what is necessary for achieving the purported purpose,  • transparency,  • preserving the data’s integrity with subsequent updates, and • anonymization and aggregation to the extent required by law.    Iranian courts generally enforce measures against cyber violations according to the statutorily defined remedies of the applicable laws or regulations, which may include punitive damages and/or imprisonment as defined under the Cyber Crime Act; sanctions on the violators’ bank accounts, applications, and websites; and other measures. Generally, crimes committed in cyberspace are within the jurisdiction of the Special Cyber Crime Court and the Iranian Cyber Police (a.k.a. FATA).9                                                             “Protection of Individuals Who Are Promoting Islamic Ethics,” May 23, 2015, art. 5, Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran, May 23, 2015, No. 20464, https://perma.cc/4S9R-JB4R; Charter on Citizens Rights, Nov. 2016, arts. 36–40, https://perma.cc/VUW7-PD6Z; Draft of the Bill on the Protection of Data and Privacy in Cyberspace, June 2018, arts. 1–2, 4–8, 12, 14, 19, 26, 27, 67, 68, https://perma.cc/KA2Z-52AT.  7 Islamic Penal Code of Iran 1392 [2013], art. 62, https://perma.cc/A4PS-C7L4. 8 A “secure information system” is defined as an information system that is reasonably protected against misuse or penetration; possesses a reasonable level of proper accessibility and administration; is reasonably designed and organized in accordance with the significance of the task; and is in compliance with secure methods. A “secure method” is a method to authenticate the date, correctness, origin, and destination of data messages, as well as to detect errors and modifications in its communication, content, or storage “from a certain point.” A secure message is generated using algorithms or codes, identification words or numbers, encryption, acknowledgement call-back procedures, or similar secure techniques.

Data Retention and Location Tracking Legislation   The juxtaposition of the general privacy and data protection framework (as explained in Part II(A), above) and the laws and regulations that reserve the government’s right to access private data in situations involving a governmental or public purposes is shown in various statutes and regulations.    Pursuant to article 150 of the Criminal Procedure Code 2015, controlling an individuals’ telecommunications is prohibited, except when it is necessary for the national security of the country or in investigation of certain enumerated crimes, and in the case of such exceptions it must be carried out within a specific scope and timeframe. Furthermore, the Supreme National Security Council (SNSC)10 is the authority that would determine the conditions and requirements for such access or investigation.11  Article 15 of the Law on Release and Freedom of Information 2010 is directed at any governmental or nongovernmental entity that might receive a request for release of information that is entrusted with the respective entity, emphasizing that such entities must refrain from providing any data that might reveal private information of a natural person third party, except if the requester is a public entity and that according to the law the requested information is directly relevant to its responsibilities as a public entity, or when the third party has provided express written consent.12                                                   of Iran arts. 4, 40, 150; Law on “Protection of Individuals Who Are Promoting Islamic Ethics” art. 5; Charter on Citizens Rights arts. 36–40; Draft of the Bill on Protection of Data and Privacy in Cyberspace arts. 1–2, 4–8, 12, 14, 19, 26, 27, 67, 68.  10 The Supreme National Security Council, led by the Iranian President, is the highest-ranking power after the Supreme Leader in matters of national security against domestic and global threats. The Council’s enumerated constitutional authorities for the main purpose of defending national security are explicitly within the limits provided by the Supreme Leader, and its decisions are enforceable as law after his approval. Among the constitutional authorities granted to the Supreme National Security Council is the power to entrust parts of its responsibilities to sub-councils, in which case those sub-councils remain under the control of the President of the country, or the President can delegate the control to another member of the Supreme National Security Council. The National Headquarters for Combating Corona, as a sub-entity of the Supreme National Security Council, could arguably be considered a political entity as well; hence, it is plausible that it could be immune from citizens’ lawsuits.

According to Article 176 of the Constitution, the Supreme National Security Council consists of the heads of the three branches of the government (the President as the Chairman of the Council, the Speaker of the Parliament, and the Chief Justice), two representatives appointed by the Supreme Leader, the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, the Chief of the Army, the Chief of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Minister of the Interior, the Minister of Intelligence, the Head of the Management and Planning Organization, and the minister of the ministry that is the subject of the Council’s agenda at the time.   11 Criminal Procedure Code of Iran arts. 4, 40, 150. 12 Law on Release and Freedom of Information arts. 13–15. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Iran The Law Library of Congress 171 Article 39 of the Charter on Citizens Rights 2017 reiterates that all entities and natural and legal persons must protect the privacy and security of the personal data entrusted to them; however, they must also provide the said data to “judicial institutions and eligible administrative institutions,” upon necessity and request.13    Article 4 of the draft Bill on Protection of Data and Privacy in Cyberspace, which has remained in the legislative process since 2018,14 would require the consent of individuals to access their private data if access was not due to public concerns and circumstances.15 Article 6 of the same bill would authorize access to individuals’ private data concerning public issues and circumstances, if the individuals directly or indirectly exposed their data or failed to adjust their settings to prevent third-party access.      Article 32 of the Cyber Crime Act 2009 requires providers of electronic, internet, or data services to keep all metadata and tracing data for any information that enters their cyberspace, including the data’s type, origin, direction, destination, duration, date, time, etc. This data must be retained for a minimum of six months from the date of creation of the data. The users’ information, such as IP address, personal identity information, geographic location data, phone numbers, etc., must be retained for a minimum of six months from the date of termination of services.16      Generally, in Islamic jurisprudence violating an individual’s private zone, whether that involves a person’s body, private assets, or information, in a manner that is against the individual’s dignity is widely abhorred, and the protection of one’s own and others’ privacy is greatly encouraged; accordingly, a similar approach is visible in Iranian legislations that is substantially motivated by Sharia. However, in both Islamic jurisprudence and Iranian laws and judicial precedent there are principles that grant supreme importance to the benefit of the public and protection of the Islamic system of governance, which, depending on the circumstances, could outweigh the individuals’ privacy and data protection rights if those rights are incompatible with the stated benefits.  A partial oversight measure for this potential incompatibility is that if a governmental entity’s regulations, decisions, or measures or a public nongovernmental entity’s actions infringe a natural or legal person’s privacy and data protection rights, such person has legal standing to hold the governmental or public nongovernmental entities accountable, according to article 12 of the Law on the Organization and Procedure of the Court of Administrative Justice.17 However, the same statute exempts regulations, decisions, or other measures of a number of indicated entities, which all act in political or judicial capacities, including the Supreme National Security Council. According to some of the available legal interpretations, the reason for this exception is                                                  13 Charter on Citizens Rights of Nov. 2016, arts. 36–40. 14 Necessity of Passing Draft Bill on Protection of Data and Privacy in Cyberspace, Islamic Republic News Agency (Feb. 12, 2020), https://perma.cc/9A9H-SDEV.  15 Draft of the Bill on the Protection of Data and Privacy in Cyberspace arts. 1–2, 4–8, 12, 14, 19, 26, 27, 67, 68.  16 Cybercrime Act arts. 1, 2, 5, 25, 32, 34, 38, 39, 48, https://perma.cc/723P-9WNU. 17 Enacted pursuant to article 173 of the Constitution, https://perma.cc/JN9G-4QUV, https://perma.cc/3CGR-CNRF (English translation).  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Iran The Law Library of Congress 172 that the regulations, decisions, or measures by the political or judicial entities are not subject to legal action, and the same principle would apply to their sub-entities.18     III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  Iran has not adopted any laws, regulations or other public measures19 that would allow the use of unauthorized or mandatory electronic means to assess general adherence to confinement measures to fight COVID-19 spread. However, it has created a few COVID-19-dedicated applications, websites, and phone services for self-assessments and tracking the spread of the coronavirus. The following apps and websites are operating based on the decisions, support, or authorization of the National Headquarters for Combating Corona;20 the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, which leads the National Headquarters for Combating Corona; and the Ministry of Information and Communication Technology (ICT).                                                     18 Analysis of the Plausibility of Judicial Oversight of the National Headquarters for Combating Corona, supra note 10. 19 It is notable that pursuant to the Decree of the Supreme Administrative Council Concerning the Charter on Citizens’ Rights in the Administrative Systems, the government must be fully transparent regarding decisions and measures that would impact people’s rights or benefits; however, again, this law is only applicable to administrative systems and is silent regarding governmental entities such as the Supreme National Security Council and its sub-councils that are acting in a political capacity. Decree of the Supreme Administrative Council Concerning the Charter on Citizens’ Rights in the Administrative Systems art. 1, § 4, Official Gazette of the Islamic Republic of Iran, Apr. 10, 2017, No. 20995, https://perma.cc/HYL4-ST89.     20 Reportedly, beginning on February 26, 2020, public sessions of the Parliament were indefinitely terminated (but resumed after 44 days) on the orders of the National Headquarters for Combating Corona, which had been established on February 22, 2020, by an act of the Supreme National Security Council, with the invested authority to create, coordinate, and enforce relevant national guidelines, and utilize national resources to stop the spread of COVID-19.  Because the National Headquarters for Combating Corona is a sub-entity of the Supreme National Security Council, its decisions are equivalent to those of its founding Council and, as such, are deemed valid laws. Depending on the circumstances, those decisions can supersede laws passed by the Parliament. The Head of the staff of the National Headquarters is the Minister of Health and Medical Education. Other members are the Deputy Minister of Health and Medical Education; Spokesperson of the Ministry of Health; Minister of the Interior; Minister of Roads and Urban Development; Minister of Education; Minister of Science, Research and Technology; Minister of Cultural Heritage, Tourism and Handicrafts; Minister of Culture and Islamic Guidance; Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces; Attorney General; Head of the Management and Planning Organization; Director General of the Islamic Republic of Iran Broadcasting (IRIB); Head of Iran’s Hajj and Pilgrimage Organization; government’s Spokesperson; and Iran’s Chief of Police.

The AC19 AppOn or around March 3, 2020, the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education reportedly sent a text message to all cell phones across the country, encouraging people to download the AC19 app (a.k.a. ”the Application for Combating Coronavirus“ or ”the Application Against Coronavirus”). The app allows users to access a COVID-19 self-assessment test, suggesting that it would be a reasonable measure for people with mild symptoms to stay in self-quarantine and to receive an assessment/medical assistance through the application, instead of heading to the hospitals. AC19 is an Android application21 that is currently available in Café Bazaar, an Iranian website for downloading apps, movies, games, etc., as well as on the AC19 website.22 The AC19 app was created by the Tehran Headquarters for Combating Corona, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education, and the ICT.23   This app reportedly prompts users to provide permission to access their Android devises’ location, and requests personal information such as the users’ phone numbers, names, and addresses. It also asks questions regarding their COVID-19 medical symptoms and those of their family members and social contacts, as well as information concerning age, gender, weight, etc. The AC19 app has caused contention and mistrust for many users and reporters, for several reasons:  •The prompt for accessing the user’s location data is from Android and not the Iranianapplication developers, hence, it is in English unless the users have changed their Android’ssettings to Farsi.•Users of older Android phones do not receive any prompts at all.•According to information published by a London-based security researcher, whodownloaded the application and evaluated its programming, it is collecting locationdatacoarse location (WiFi and mobile-based), fine location (GPS-based), latitude, andlongitudewith a precision of less than three meters, as well as the live movements of thedevices, such as with fitness apps.2421 According to Statcounter Global Status, over 88% of the Iran’s cell phone subscribers are using Android.

The Salamat Website   Following the contentious reactions to the AC19 app, the Ministry of Health and Medical Education published a guideline for the general public and developers of COVID-19 apps and websites, indicating that all developers must comply with the guidelines of the National Headquarters for Combating Corona; must register with Ministry of Health and Medical Education prior to operating; and must not obtain any personally identifiable information from the users, such as the National Identification Codes or phone numbers, but must instead, direct the users whose assessments show a higher probability of  infection to the Salamat.gov.ir website26 for a unified medical response and registration.    In the same guideline, the Ministry of Health asked people to register with the Salamat.gov.ir website for self-assessment and medical measures, and stated that a list of authorized COVID-19 apps and websites will be shortly available for the public.27 In order to do the self-assessment test on the Salamat website the users will have to enter their National Identity Codes and dates of birth, and answer questions regarding their COVID-19 medical symptoms and those of their family members and social contacts. If the assessment shows a high risk of infection, the user will be instructed regarding the closest hospitals and health centers, and a health provider will contact the user through a dedicated (4030) phone number.28    3.  The Mask App and Website   Mask is a movement-tracing app that was built for the Ministry of Health and Medical Education by a group of volunteer technical experts from Sharif, Amirkabir, and Shahid Beheshti Universities. It is available on the Mask.ir website29 and through Café Bazaar. The app’s website educates users regarding the developers, goals, and scope of the app’s access to user data. It provides an infection-risk map that is based on aggregated data obtained from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education and a live contact/infection-risk notification service.  In order to view the map, users do not have to provide personal information. However, to use the self-assessment test, infection-risk notifications, etc., users must register by entering their phone number and authorizing access to their device’s location data. The website states that Mask is                                                  25 Is the Application to Combat Corona Malware?, Islamic Republic News Agency (Mar. 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/Y597-S5X9; Catalin Cimpanu, Spying Concerns Raised Over Iran's Official COVID-19 Detection App, ZDNet (Mar. 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/Z6NV-FCC9 (in English).  26 http://www.salamat.gov.ir. 27 Draft Guidelines for Recognition and Introduction of [Legitimate] Websites, IRIB News (Mar. 10, 2020), https://perma.cc/XQZ4-KRHM. 28 Necessity of People Joining Salamat Assessment Website to Combat Corona, Iranian Students News Agency (Apr. 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/FQ7K-ENJF. 29 https://www.mask.ir/. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Iran The Law Library of Congress 175 trying to obtain from the Ministry of Health and Medical Education a list of phone numbers of those individuals who have been in close contact with confirmed cases within the last two weeks in order to notify them.

These include both voluntary and non-voluntary digital tracing to stop the chain of infection.    From March to May 2020 the government  utilized the robust surveillance technologies of the Israel Security Agency (ISA) to trace patients and those with whom they came into contact. The ISA authorization has been scrutinized by the Supreme Court, which held that its scope and duration must be regulated by law. Following the Court’s ruling the government prepared draft legislation. In response to public criticism and concerns expressed by the ISA Chief, however, the government announced on June 8, 2020, that it would not utilize the ISA abilities to trace COVID-19 patients and would not promote the legislation at this time.   The Ministry of Health offers a voluntary app, HaMagen, which is currently installed on the devices of only a small percentage of the population. The Ministry is working on improving the accuracy of the app and on increasing the number of users.   The use of tracing devices raises challenges to the right to privacy and to patients’ rights, which are protected under Israel’s basic laws, statutes, and regulations. Although not specifically required by law, the ability to utilize “privacy by design” was held by the Tel Aviv District Court to be a way to limit the harm to privacy associated with digital surveillance.   I. Introduction  Israel appears to have had relative success in curtailing the spread of the novel coronavirus pandemic. The country has a population of over nine million.1 As of May 22, 2020, 531,124 tests for COVID-19 had been conducted; 16,690 patients had been diagnosed with COVID-19; 13,915 had recovered; and 279 had died.2 Due to the low infection rate, the government has been gradually easing social distancing requirements and the economy continues to open under conditions posted on the Ministry of Health (MOH) website.3  Cell phones are widely used in Israel. As of 2020, the number of mobile phone internet users in Israel reached about 6.5 million.4 As discussed below, the number of Israelis uploading a                                                  1 Population, Central Bureau of Statistics (last updated Mar. 2020), https://perma.cc/49AN-MSE7. 2 Coronavirus, Ministry of Health (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/8W93-VPJX (in Hebrew). 3 Corona Outbreak, Latest Updates, Davidson Institute, Weizmann Institute of Science (updated May 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/44HX-JPVU (in Hebrew). 4 Number of mobile phone internet users in Israel from 2015 to 2023, Statista, https://perma.cc/PV5G-DFDF. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Israel The Law Library of Congress 178 voluntary app for COVID-19 tracing reflects the willingness of a significant, though insufficient, portion of the population to share personal data in relation to the pandemic. Improvement of the app’s features is expected to increase the number of users.5  II.  Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   1. Constitutional and Legislative Guarantees  Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty recognizes that “[a]ll persons have the right to privacy and to intimacy . . . [and that] there shall be no violation of the confidentiality of conversation, or of the writings or records of a person.”6 The constitutional right to privacy, however, is qualified by a “limitation clause” in section 8 of the Basic Law, which requires that any law that limits the rights set out in the Basic Law, including the protected right to privacy, must “[comport with the] values of the State of Israel, [be] enacted for a proper purpose, and to an extent no greater than is required.”7  Personal and medical privacy are protected by a number of statutory laws and regulations, including the Privacy Protection Law, 5741-1981 (PPL);8 the Secret Monitoring Law, 5739-1979 (SML);9 and the Patient’s Rights Law, 5756-1996 (PRL),10 as well as by court rulings.  2. Consent for Disclosure  The PPL prohibits the violation of a person’s privacy without his or her consent. The PPL considers the “breach of the duty of confidentiality provided by law regarding a person’s private affairs” as a violation of privacy.11                                                    5 See “HaMagen Voluntary COVID-19 Tracing App,” Part III(B), below. 6 Basic Law: Human Dignity and Liberty § 7(d), Sefer Hahukim [SH] No. 1391, 5752 (Mar. 25, 1992), this and all citations below as amended, https://perma.cc/CTP5-RQMD (unofficial English translation).

Handling of Sensitive Information  The storage and sharing of sensitive data in databanks, including data on an individual’s personality, health, financial status, opinions, or beliefs, is regulated under the PPL and the Privacy Protection (Data Security) (ISA) Regulations, 5777-2017 (PPDS).14 The PPDS requirements for data protection by databank controllers and processors apply to both the public and private sectors.15 Sensitive information related to health requires either mid- or high-level security protection when preserved in a databank.16                                                      12 PRL § 20(b). 13 Id. § 20(a)(1), (2) & (5). 14 PPL ch.

Data Retention and Location Tracking  1. Data Retention of Health Records  The PPDS requires mid-level security for databases that are owned by a public body or that are principally intended “to collect data for delivery to another entity,”17 and that generally includes sensitive information, such as medical, genetic, or biometric information.18 Databases that would otherwise require mid-level security but include information on more than 100,000 people or are accessible by more than 100 persons, would generally require high-level security.19   2.  Telecommunications   Databank owners may not connect databank systems to the internet or to any other public system without installing proper protection against unauthorized penetration of the system or against software capable of causing damage to hardware or other software. Moreover, the transfer of information from a databank on a public system or the internet must utilize common encryption methods. The identity of the user and his or her grant of permission to use the databank will be verified. Access to databanks at mid- and high-levels of security must be provided through a means that is subject to the exclusive control of the access permit holder.20   3.  Storing and Sharing of Location Data  A decision rendered by Tel Aviv District Court Judge Agmon-Gonen on July 1, 2019, addressed the danger to privacy that may result from utilizing cross identification enabled by access to big data. The case involved the unauthorized disclosure of personal location data resulting from a requirement that caregivers of Israel Defense Force (IDF) disabled veterans report their work by mobile signature at the beginning and end of their shifts. 21   Agmon-Gonen determined that the violation of privacy to the caregivers resulting from the requirement did not exceed what was required under the circumstances.22 It did result, however, in a violation of the right to privacy of the disabled veterans because the care provided might include taking or staying with the disabled veterans outside of their homefor example, when the disabled veteran needed a short psychiatric hospital stay. The use of location data, she held, might “reveal data, such as health information, found in the core of the right to privacy [and]                                                  17 PPDS § 1, KT 5777 No. 7809 p. 1022, https://perma.cc/6UH6-KD6B. 18 Id., App. 1. For specific procedures see Ruth Levush, Israel, in Online Privacy Law (2017 Update) 17 (Law Library of Congress, Dec. 2017), https://perma.cc/XN5R-FU2S. 19 PPDS, App. 2. 20 Id. § 14. 21 Adm. TA 28857-06-17 Disabled Veterans Association v. Ministry of Defense (decision by Judge Michal Agmon-Gonen), https://perma.cc/C3RM-DNAA (in Hebrew). 22 Id. para. 16.6A. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Israel The Law Library of Congress 181 expose location data [which] constituted unlawful harm to the privacy of the disabled [veterans].”23   She further concluded that the technology of “privacy by design” could enable caregiver reporting without harming the right to privacy. A tender for selecting a company that would monitor the IDF’s employment of veterans’ caregivers, therefore, should have required that bidding companies would use mobile signature software incorporating principles of “privacy by design” to limit the infringement of the veterans’ right of privacy. For example, a cellular signature could be required at the start and end of the caregiver shift, when the caregiver is with the disabled veterans for the whole shift, without keeping location data.24 As this has not been done, Judge Agmon-Gonen concluded that  [i]t was impossible to say that the least harmful means was chosen. Therefore, it should be determined, and also anchored in the tender with the monitoring company, that a cellular signature be made so that it does not reveal the location of the disabled, and be designed so that their privacy is not harmed beyond what is required.25   III. Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  In an effort to stop the spread of the virus the MOH has offered a voluntary app called HaMagen to trace COVID-19 patients and those with whom they have been in contact. HaMagen is currently installed on the devices of 1.5 million Israelis, constituting only a small percentage of the population.26   In addition, the government has authorized the Israel Security Agency (ISA),27 which normally handles threats to national security, to conduct surveillance on Israeli citizens and residents in order to stop the spread of the virus. A legislative framework defining the ISA’s surveillance scope and duration is currently being considered by the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) following a decision rendered by the Supreme Court on April 26, 2020, requiring anchoring the ISA authorization in legislation rather than in government decisions.28                                                     23 Id. para. 16.6B. 24 Id. para 16.8. 25 Id. 26 Sagi Cohen, Ministry of Health in Contacts to Connect the HaMagen App to Apple and Google’s Corona Venture, The Marker (May 4, 2020), https://perma.cc/F9VF-9WSE (in Hebrew). 27 “The Unseen Shield”, Israel Security Agency, https://perma.cc/D8KH-JFZZ. 28 HC 2109/20 Ben Meir v.

Electronic Surveillance by Israel Security Agency  1. Legal Basis  On March 17, 2020, the Israeli government issued the Emergency Regulations (Authorization of the Israel Security Service to Assist the National Effort to Reduce the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus), 5780-2020.29 The Emergency Regulations were in effect for a period of 14 days and then replaced by Government Decision No. 4916, on March 24, 2020,30 and by Government Decision No. 4950, on March 31, 2020, extending surveillance authorities to April 30, 2020.31 The government expressed interest in further extending the ISA’s authorization, especially when social distancing and other restrictions were being lifted.32    Government Decision No. 4950 was issued pursuant to section 7(b)(6) of the ISA Law, 5762-2002, which authorizes the ISA to engage in activities other than those enumerated by the Law, as determined by the government, with the approval of the Knesset (Israel’s parliament) Committee on the ISA, to be necessary to protect and promote essential national security interests.33  2. Scope of Surveillance  In accordance with Government Decision No. 4950, the ISA was authorized  (a) . . . to receive, collect and process technological information to assist the Ministry of Health in conducting an examination regarding the period of 14 days prior to a patient’s diagnosis, for identifying location data and movement paths of a patient and for identification of persons who came into contact with him, to identify the source of the patient’s virus infection and who might be infected by him . . . .  (b) [and to] . . . transmit necessary information details to the Ministry of Health . . . so that the Ministry of Health can give guidance to patients, people who have come into close contact with them and the general public.34  The decision defines “technological information” as  [t]elecommunication data of . . . identification, location and communication, excluding content of conversations within the meaning of the wiretapping law, 5739-1979, as approved by the Knesset Service [ISA] Committee.35                                                  29 Emergency Regulations (Authorization of the General Security Service to Assist the National Effort to Reduce the Spread of the Novel Coronavirus), 5780-2020, KT 5780 No. 8393 p. 782, https://perma.cc/UJ92-HGSK. 30 Government Decision No. 4916 (Mar. 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/BX22-U99R. 31 Government Decision No. 4950 (Mar. 31, 2020), https://perma.cc/U4T2-G8HT 32 For government decisions on reopening as of May 14, 2020, see Press Release, Ministry of Health, New Resolutions Regarding Re-Opening (Mar. 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/5JA2-RLEY. 33 ISA Law, 5762-2002, SH 5762 No. 1832 p. 179, as amended, https://perma.cc/E2TJ-DLEY. 34 Decision No. 4950 § 2. 35 Id. § 3. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Israel The Law Library of Congress 183 It defines “necessary information” details as follows:  (1) For a patient: Location data and traffic routes in the period of 14 days before the day of diagnosis.  (2) For persons who have come into contact with a patient: a full name, identity card number, telephone number, date of birth, date, time and location of last exposure to the patient, . . . to the extent possible and necessary.36  3. Legitimacy of ISA Authorization to Conduct Surveillance on Patients and Contacts  The validity of the ISA’s authority to conduct surveillance in the context of the pandemic was reviewed by the Supreme Court. In a unanimous decision rendered on April 26, 2020, the Court held that the ISA authorization could not be based on government decisions. Instead, that authorization had to be anchored in legislation.37   On May 5, 2020, the Knesset Intelligence Subcommittee approved a three-week extension of the government’s use of ISA surveillance assistance to fight the COVID-19 pandemic. The extension was granted to enable advancement of the legislative process.38  In response to public criticism, on June 8, 2020, the government decided to stop utilizing ISA surveillance for COVID-19 tracing and put on hold legislative efforts for securing its statutory authorization.  According to Israeli media, draft legislation providing such authorization in this regard would be authorized by the Ministerial Legislative Committee, but not be submitted for Knesset approval at this time. Expressing his “discomfort” in the ISA usage of its electronic technologies for purposes of monitoring patients, ISA Chief Nadav Argman has reportedly stated that, “if the [pandemic] outbreak was renewed, the law could be quickly enacted, and the ‘ISA would be prepared.’ ” He offered ISA assistance in the improvement of a voluntary app.39  B. HaMagen Voluntary COVID-19 Tracing App  As compared with the robust technological surveillance abilities of the ISA, the HaMagen app provides more limited and a less accurate level of monitoring patients and their contacts. The HaMagen may be uploaded on a voluntary basis. It was launched by the MOH in March 2020 with the objective of stopping the chain of COVID-19 infection.40                                                     36 Id. 37 HC 2109/20 Ben Meir v.

HaMagen System Characteristics  The HaMagen app cross-checks the GPS history of any subscriber against historical geographic data of patients identified by the MOH. The app is available in five languages: Hebrew, Arabic, English, Russian, and Amharic.41  The app is free to download from the App Store and Google Play. It notifies subscribers if they “crossed paths with a COVID-19 patient,” provides the exact time and location of the contact, and allows them to “review, and confirm or reject the notification.”42 Upon confirmation, the user will be asked go into isolation and report to the MOH. If the message in the notification is incorrect, the user “can reject it and carry on as normal.”43  Files shared by HaMagen are generated in the MOH’s epidemiological system, and contain   . . . only verified information that was received from laboratories and epidemiological investigations and is monitored by the Ministry of Health. Prior to sending, the file is digitally signed with the Ministry of Health’s digital signature. Upon receiving the file, the digital signature is examined by the application, to verify that the file was received from the Ministry of Health in an orderly manner, in order to prevent the breach of malware into the application.44   The MOH website contains a detailed privacy policy for the HaMagen app. With regard to information sharing, the policy states as follows:  • The Ministry of Health puts great emphasis on the information’s confidentiality and privacy. Accordingly, any information shared with the Ministry of Health will go through an encrypted channel and stored in the Ministry’s servers in accordance with all procedures and protocols on information security and protection of privacy applicable to the Israeli healthcare system, and in accordance with the law.  • The Ministry of Health runs routine maintenance checks of the measures ensuring information security and protection of privacy and updates them as needed.45  2. Rate of Use and Accuracy  According to the Ministry of Health, the HaMagen app is currently installed on the devices of 1.5 million Israelis, constituting only a small percentage of the population. Based on GPS location data, the app has been criticized as insufficiently accurate, “certainly not at the required two meters [approx. 6.56 feet]. The app knows if people were around each other, but not beyond that. Nor is it able to identify the location of people within buildings.”46                                                   41 HaMagen, MOH, https://perma.cc/7CSC-8TMS. 42 Id. 43 Id. 44 Privacy Policy, para. 6, MOH (last updated May 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/392C-6HBW. 45 Id. para. 9. 46 Cohen, supra note 26. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: Israel The Law Library of Congress 185  The MOH is reportedly working on adding Bluetooth technology to the app, which will enable identification within buildings and improve accuracy. One commentator opined that  To be effective at curbing the epidemic when removing restrictions, the app needs to be installed with a much larger number of devices - including, as far as possible, in the Arab and ultra-Orthodox sectors. For example, according to a study in Oxford, in order for the Bluetooth-based contact detection app to stop the epidemic, about 60% of the population needs to install the app.  …The need to improve the accuracy of the protective app and dramatically increase its users’ reach is important for two reasons: to stop the pandemic’s spread in the coming months of the quarantine’s opening; and to make the ISA’s intrusive and controversial means of surveillance unnecessary.47  According to an op-ed by two Israeli experts in game theory and behavioral economics,  the inaccuracy of the HaMagen app alongside the use of mobile tracing tools whose sources of information are unknown to the public has resulted in the sending of numerous false alerts and inconsistent messages between the systems, causing many people to lose confidence in the app as a way to fight the corona epidemic.48   They argued that to counter resistance to their use, surveillance apps should incorporate carriers’ risk assessment features while preserving the privacy of users. Risk assessment features, they opined, would be welcomed by the public as such features would save users’ time and convey the users’ commitment to fighting the virus.49                                                      47 Id. 48 Ido Arev & Oren First, I Am Open, Therefore I Am Safe, Calcalist (May 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/NYG7-JQQG (in Hebrew).  49 Id. \fThe Law Library of Congress 186 South Africa Hanibal Goitom Chief, FCIL I   SUMMARY As part of the effort to combat and mitigate the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, South Africa established an interim database, the COVID-19 Tracing Database, within the Department of Health. All health care professionals who test a person for COVID-19 must report the person’s identification and contact information, including cellphone number, for inclusion in the Database. All accommodation establishments must report similar information relating to anyone who uses their services during the national lockdown. The director-general of the Department is authorized to mandate electronic communications service providers to report to her the location and movements of persons known or suspected of having COVID-19 and anyone who is reasonably suspected to have come into contact with such persons. The director-general is not obligated to inform the persons whose location and movement is being tracked until after the end of the state of national disaster.     The authority of the director-general is subject to some restrictions and oversight. For instance, the director-general’s authority to track location and movement of persons is limited to the period from March 5, 2020, through the end of the national state of disaster. Such information may only be obtained, used, or disclosed by authorized persons and only for the purpose of combatting the spread of COVID-19. All information in the Database must be de-identified (anonymized) or destroyed within six-weeks after the expiration of the national state of disaster and this process is subject to judicial and parliamentary oversight. Significantly, the collection or use of tracking information for a purpose other than combating the spread of COVID-19, unauthorized disclosure of information in the Database, retention of such information beyond the period authorized by law, or failure to de-identify or destroy information as required by law is an offense punishable on conviction by a fine, custodial sentence, or both.    The collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in South Africa is governed under the 1996 Constitution, common law, and a number of statutes. One such law is the 2013 Protection of Personal Information Act. The Act imposes various conditions under which the lawful processing of personal information (including location information) may take place, including accountability, processing limitation, purpose specification, further processing limitation, information quality, openness, security safeguards, and data subject participation, as further defined by statute. Although most parts of the Act have yet to take effect, a guidance note issued by the Information Regulator, an institution established under parts of the Act already in force, requires that processing of personal information done for the purpose of combatting COVID-19 must adhere to the conditions set under the Act.      \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 187 I. Introduction  As of May 22, South Africa had conducted 543,032 tests and registered 20,125 confirmed COVID-19 cases.1 On the same day, South Africa recorded 988 new cases.2 Of the persons infected, so far 10,104 have recovered and 397 have died.3  As part of its effort to combat the spread of COVID-19, South Africa has put in place measures leveraging technology (described in Part III, below), mainly using location and movement data to conduct contact tracing of infected persons and persons who have come into contact with infected persons. The level of permeation of mobile and smartphones in the country, whose population is estimated at about 56.5 million,4 is important in this regard. As of 2018, mobile cellular subscriptions stood at around 92.5 million, representing about 167 subscriptions per 100 residents in the country.5 According to the Independent Communications Authority of South Africa (ICASA), the official regulator of the South African communications, broadcasting and postal services sectors, smartphone penetration nearly doubled in a span of two years, from 43.5% in 2016 to 81.7% in 2018.6 According to the same report, in 2018, South Africa had 65.8 million mobile cellular data subscriptions, a 12.3% increase since 2015, and about 12.6 million LTE device subscriptions.7   However, this information must be read in context. According to one source, “[t]he penetration rate likely reflects that many South Africans have more than one smartphone, while a significant portion of citizens are still reliant on basic or feature phones.”8 According to a Pew Research Centre report, based on a spring 2017 survey, 51% South Africans owned smartphones that could access the internet and apps.9                                                                  1 Press Release, Department of Health, Republic of South Africa, Update on Covid-19 (May 22, 2020), https://perma.cc/5U6V-DKQF. 2 Id.

Legal Framework   A. Privacy and Data Protection   The collection, use, and disclosure of personal information in South Africa is governed under the 1996 Constitution, common law, and a number of statutes, including the Promotion of Access to Information Act, the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act, and the National Credit Act.10 In 2013, South Africa enacted the Protection of Personal Information Act, which is considered a codification of privacy protections under the country’s common law; however, most parts of the Act have yet to take effect.11 Nevertheless, the Information Regulator (the Regulator), an entity established under the parts of the Act already in force, recently issued a guidance document requiring responsible parties to follow the requirements under the Act (see Part II(B)(1), below) and the Guidance when processing personal information. Other laws relevant to privacy issues include the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act and the National Health Act. Relevant parts of these laws are discussed below.  1. The Constitution  The right to privacy is guaranteed by the Bill of Rights chapter of the 1996 Constitution, which states that   [e]veryone has the right to privacy, which includes the right not to have  a. their person or home searched; b. their property searched; c. their possessions seized; or d. the privacy of their communications infringed.12  Limitations may be imposed on the right to privacy, but “only in terms of law of general application to the extent that the limitation is reasonable and justifiable in an open and democratic society based on human dignity, equality and freedom, taking into account all relevant factors.”13 Among the factors that must be considered when imposing a limitation are the importance of the purpose for which the limitation is proposed, the nature and extent of the proposed limitation, the relationship between the proposed limitation and its purpose, and the least restrictive means of achieving the purpose.14                                                                 10 Adrian Naude, Data Protection in South Africa: The Impact of Protection of Personal Information Act and Recent International Developments (unpublished LLM Thesis, University of Pretoria) (Dec. 2014), https://perma.cc/S5LP-WEPC.  11 Data Protection Laws of the World: South Africa, DLA Piper (last modified Jan. 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/AA99-5Q72.  12 South Afr.

Protection of Personal Information Act  The Protection of Personal Information Act (POPIA) permits the processing of personal information in certain circumstances. It defines “personal information” as “information relating to an identifiable, living, natural person, and where applicable, an identifiable, existing juristic person, including but not limited to . . . any identifying number, symbol, e-mail address, physical address, telephone number, location information, online identifier or other particular assignment to the person.”15 The term “processing” includes “the collection, receipt, recording, organisation, collation, storage, updating or modification, retrieval, alteration, consultation or use” of personal information.16   POPIA puts in place general conditions under which the lawful processing of personal information may take place, including accountability, processing limitation, purpose specification, further processing limitation, information quality, openness, security safeguards, and data subject participation, as further defined by statute.17 As noted above, the term “personal information” includes location information. The “purpose specification” clause of POPIA requires that the collection of personal information be limited to “a specific, explicitly defined and lawful purpose related to a function or activity of the responsible party.”18 It also requires that further processing of personal information be compatible with the purpose of collection.19 Significantly, it provides that further processing of personal information is considered compatible with the purpose of collection if “it is necessary to prevent or mitigate a serious and imminent threat to– (i) public health or public safety; or (ii) the life or health of the data subject or another individual.”20  POPIA bars the processing of special information21 except in certain limited instances, including when the data subject consents or it is “necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of a                                                              15 Protection of Personal Information Act No. 4 of 2003 (POPIA) § 1 (Nov. 19, 2013), https://perma.cc/ZN2A-PFBN. Once implemented, POPIA will introduce the same definition of the term “personal information” to the Promotion of Access to Information Act No. 2 of 2000 (PAIA), § 1 (Feb. 2, 2000), https://perma.cc/56Z5-PWH3, and the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act No. 25 of 2002 (ECTA), § 1 (July 31, 2002), https://perma.cc/A5TF-3MU9.

Id.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 190 right or obligation in law.”22 In this situation, additional conditions relating to the specific information in question apply.23  As noted above, POPIA makes putting in place security safeguards one of the conditions for processing personal information. The Act states that “[a] responsible party must secure the integrity and confidentiality of personal information in its possession or under its control by taking appropriate, reasonable technical and organisational measures to prevent– (a) loss of, damage to or unauthorized destruction of personal information; and (b) unlawful access to or processing of personal information.”24 In order to effectively meet this requirement, the party must take reasonable steps to   (a) identify all reasonably foreseeable internal and external risks to personal information in its possession or under its control;  (b) establish and maintain appropriate safeguards against the risks identified;  (c) regularly verify that the safeguards are effectively implemented; and  (d)  ensure that the safeguards are continually updated in response to new risks or deficiencies in previously implemented safeguards.25  POPIA does not apply to instances of processing of personal information by or for a public body involving “national security, including activities that are aimed at assisting in the identification of the financing of terrorist and related activities, defence or public safety.”26 Nevertheless, as noted above, the Regulator’s recent Guidance (see Part II(B)(1), below) requires that responsible parties, including relevant government entities, adhere to rules under the Act when processing personal information of data subjects as part of the effort to curb COVID-19.   3. Electronic Communications and Transactions Act  Application of the Electronic Communications and Transactions Act (ECTA) is limited to instances in which personal information is collected through electronic transactions.27 A data controller “may voluntarily subscribe” to the principles for electronically collecting personal information stipulated in the Act by recording such fact in an agreement with a data subject; however, the data controller must subscribe to all the applicable principles and not just parts thereof.28 Once POPIA takes effect, it will amend the definition of the term “personal information” under ECTA to include location information.29 In addition, application of the provisions of ECTA relating to the protection of personal information will be limited to instances                                                              22 Id. § 27(1)(b).  23 Id. §§ 28 & 33. 24 Id. § 19(1).  25 Id. § 19(2). 26 Id. § 6.  27 ECTA § 50.  28 Id.  29 POPIA § 110. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 191 where they are more extensive than the principles and protections afforded under POPIA.30 ECTA includes nine principles for electronically collecting personal information:   (1) A data controller must have the express written permission of the data subject for the collection, collation, processing or disclosure of any personal information on that data subject unless he or she is permitted or required to do so by law. (2) A data controller may not electronically request, collect, collate, process or store personal information on a data subject which is not necessary for the lawful purpose for which the personal information is required. (3) The data controller must disclose in writing to the data subject the specific purpose for which any personal information is being requested, collected, collated, processed or stored. (4) The data controller may not use the personal information for any other purpose than the disclosed purpose without the express written permission of the data subject, unless he or she is permitted or required to do so by law. (5) The data controller must, for as long as the personal information is used and for a period of at least one year thereafter, keep a record of the personal information and the specific purpose for which the personal information was collected. (6) A data controller may not disclose any of the personal information held by it to a third party, unless required or permitted by law or specifically authorised to do so in writing by the data subject. (7) The data controller must, for as long as the personal information is used and for a period of at least one year thereafter, keep a record of any third party to whom the personal information was disclosed and of the date on which and the purpose for which it was disclosed.  (8) The data controller must delete or destroy all personal information which has become obsolete.  (9) A party controlling personal information may use that personal information to compile profiles for statistical purposes and may freely trade with such profiles and statistical data, as long as the profiles or statistical data cannot be linked to any specific data subject by a third party.31  4. Promotion of Access to Information Act  Aimed at implementing the access to information clause of the Constitution, the Promotion of Access to Information Act (PAIA) includes some key data protection provisions. PAIA accords a person the right to access records held by public or private bodies containing his or her personal information.32 As in the case of ECTA, when POPIA takes effect, the definition of the term “personal information” under PAIA will be amended to include location information.33 In addition, it bars a public or a private body from disclosing records if doing so “would involve the                                                              30 Id. 3(2)(b). 31 ECTA § 51.  32 PAIA §§ 11 & 50. 33 POPIA § 110. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 192 unreasonable disclosure of personal information about a third party, including a deceased individual.”34 The Act further requires that public and private bodies take reasonable steps to put in place internal measures for correcting personal information.35  5. Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act   As a general rule, the Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act (RICA) bars interception of communication, stating that “no person may intentionally intercept or attempt to intercept, or authorise or procure any other person to intercept or attempt to intercept, at any place in the Republic, any communication in the course of its occurrence or transmission.”36 However, there are exceptions in which RICA permits the interception and monitoring of direct and indirect communications with an interception direction issued by a designated judge.37   B. Data Retention and Location Tracking  1. POPIA    As noted above, the definition of the term “personal information” under POPIA includes location information. POPIA bars the retention of personal information for a longer period than is necessary to achieve the purpose for which it was collected and processed.38 However, personal information may be retained beyond that period if the law or a contract between the parties involved authorizes or requires it, “the responsible party reasonably requires the record for lawful purposes related to its functions or activities,” or the data subject consents to it.39 Further retention is also permitted for “historical, statistical or research purposes if the responsible party has established appropriate safeguards against the records being used for any other purposes.”40  After the period for authorized retention of a record of personal information lapses, the responsible party “must destroy or delete a record of personal information or de-identify[41] it as                                                              34 PAIA §§ 34 & 63. 35 Id. § 88. 36 Regulation of Interception of Communications and Provision of Communication-Related Information Act 70 of 2002 (RICA), § 2 (Sept. 2005), https://perma.cc/K6RN-8AVH.  37 Id. § 16.  38 POPIA § 14. 39 Id. § 14.  40 Id.  41 This means deleting information that: (a) identifies the data subject; (b) can be used or manipulated by a reasonably foreseeable method to identify the data subject; or (c) can be linked by a reasonably foreseeable method to other information that identifies the data subject. Id. § 1. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 193 soon as reasonably practicable.”42 Destruction or deletion of a record of personal information “must be done in a manner that prevents its reconstruction in an intelligible form.”43  On April 3, 2020, the Regulator issued a guidance note on processing of personal information. Noting that not all the sections of POPIA have come into effect, the Regulator encouraged responsible parties to proactively comply with its provisions “when processing personal information of data subjects who have tested or are infected with COVID-19, or who have been in contact with such data subjects.”44 The Guidance states that, when processing personal information, responsible parties must adhere to a number of conditions.45   The Guidance requires electronic communications providers to provide the South African government with location-based data of their customers in certain circumstances and authorizes the government to use such information in managing the spread of COVID-19, if   a) processing complies with an obligation imposed by law on the responsible party; or b) processing protects the legitimate interest of a data subject; or  c) processing is necessary for the proper performance of a public law duty by a public body; or  d) processing is necessary for pursuing the legitimate interests of the responsible party or of a third party to whom the information is supplied.  However, the Government must still comply with all the applicable conditions for the lawful processing as set out in this Guidance Note.46  The Guidance further notes that communication service providers may provide to the government location-based data for “the purpose of conducting mass surveillance of data subjects if the personal information is anonymised or de-identified in a way that prevents its reconstruction in an intelligible form.”47                                                               42 Id. § 14. 43 Id.  44 Information Regulator, Guidance Note on the Processing of Personal Information in the Management of COVID-19 Pandemic in Terms of the Protection of Personal Information Act 4 of 2013 (POPIA), § 2 (Apr. 3, 2020), https://perma.cc/3TW2-5K24.  Section 3.7 of the Guidance note defines the term “responsible party” as a public or private body or any other person which, alone or in conjunction with others, determines the purpose of and means for processing personal information. The following are examples of responsible parties in the context of the management of COVID-19 and include but not limited to, the NCC, National Department of Health, Provincial Department, Local Government, National Institute of Communicable Disease (NICD), National Health Laboratories Services (NHLS), Independent laboratories, Mobile Network Operators, Voluntary Organizations.  45 Id. § 4.  46 Id. § 5.1.  47 Id. § 5.2. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 194 The Guidance concludes that all regulations issued to combat the spread of COVID-19 “should be implemented in conjunction with the applicable conditions for the lawful processing of personal provided for in POPIA to ensure respect for the right to privacy.”48  2. RICA  RICA requires that telecommunication service providers “(a) provide a telecommunication service which has the capability to be intercepted;[49] and (b) store communication-related information” for three to five years.50 An interception direction,51 a direction for gathering real-time communication related information,52 or a direction for gathering  archived communication may be issued for a number of reasons, including if the judge before whom the application for an interception direction is made finds that there are reasonable grounds to believe that “the gathering of information concerning an actual [or potential] threat to the public health or safety, national security or compelling national economic interests of the Republic is necessary.”53   RICA expressly bars notification of the subjects of the interception of their communication including after the conclusion of the surveillance.54  In September 2019, the Gauteng Division of the High Court of South Africa at Pretoria declared a number of RICA’s provisions unconstitutional. These include the provisions of RICA that bar                                                              48 Id. § 9.  49 The terms “intercept” and “interception” are defined by section 1 of RICA as  the aural or other acquisition of the contents of any communication through the use of any means, including an interception device, so as to make some or all of the contents of a communication available to a person other than the sender or recipient or intended recipient of that communication, and includes the –  (a) monitoring of any such communication by means of a monitoring device; (b) viewing, examination or inspection of the contents of any indirect communication; and  (c) diversion of any indirect communication from its intended destination to any other destination.  50Id. § 30(1). RICA section 1 defines “communication related information” as any information relating to an indirect communication which is available in the records of a telecommunication service provider, and includes switching, dialling or signalling information that identifies the origin, destination, termination, duration, and equipment used in respect, of each indirect communication generated or received by a customer or user of any equipment, facility or service provided by such a telecommunication service provider and, where applicable, the location of the user within the telecommunication system. 51 This is a written or oral direction issued by an authorized judge permitting interception of any communication in the country “in the course of its occurrence or transmission. RICA § 1. 52 “Real-time communication related information” is “communication-related information which is immediately available to a telecommunication service provider– (a) before, during, or for a period of 90 days after, the transmission of an indirect communication; and (b) in a manner that allows the communication-related information to be associated with the indirect communication to which it relates.” Id.   53 Id. §§ 16–19. 54 Id. §§ 16, 17(6), 18(3)(a), 20(6), 21(6) & 22(7).  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 195 notification of subjects of interception; the provision that allows for the appointment of a judge responsible for hearing applications for and issuing directions allowing surveillance, to the extent it fails to guarantee the independence of the judge; and the provisions that allow application for and obtaining a surveillance direction to the extent that they fail to “address expressly the circumstances where a subject of surveillance is either a practicing lawyer or a journalist.”55 However, as required under the South African Constitution, the High Court’s decision will only take effect if it is confirmed by the Constitutional Court.56  3. ECTA   As noted above, ECTA allows data controllers to voluntarily subscribe to a number of data privacy principles under the umbrella of which they may process data subjects’ personal information, which will include location information once a law amending POPIA takes effect. A data controller that subscribes to these principles may store personal information of the data subject.57 The applicable principles require that the data controller keep a record of the personal information in question and the record of a third party to whom the record was disclosed, if any, for as long as the personal information is used and for a period of one year afterwards.58  4. Public Health Act  The Public Health Act permits health workers and health care providers who have access to the health records of a user to disclose the user’s personal information, as defined under POPIA, “to any other person, health care provider or health establishment as is necessary for any legitimate purpose within the ordinary course and scope of his or her duties where such access or disclosure is in the interests of the user.”59 The Act also requires that a healthcare facility in possession of healthcare records “set up control measures to prevent unauthorised access to those records and to the storage facility in which, or system by which, records are kept.”60  III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  On March 15, 2020, South Africa declared a national state of disaster under the 2002 Disaster Management Act due to the coronavirus pandemic.61 During a state of disaster, the Disaster Management Act allows the government to issue regulations relating to, inter alia, “the movement of persons and goods to, from or within the disaster-stricken or threatened area,” “the dissemination of information required for dealing with the disaster,” and “other steps that may                                                              55 Amabhungane Centre for Investigative Journalism NPC and Another v.

A. Department of Communications and Postal Services Direction  On March 26, 2020, the Minister of Communications and Postal Services issued a direction that includes the following “individual track and trace” (contact tracing) clause:   The Electronic Communication Network Service (ENCS) and Electronic Communication Service (ECS) Licensee, internet ad digital sector in general, must provide location-based services in collaboration with the relevant authorities identified to support designated departments to assist and combat the spread of COVID-19.64  Responding to concerns of government intrusion into citizens’ lives, the Minister sought to reassure the public in a statement stating that,   [w]hen we say we are going to use cell phone numbers, it doesn’t meant we are going take anybody’s number. Those that test and are found to be positive . . . it is those people that the Department of Health will seek permission from the Electronic Communications Network Service (ECNS) licence[e]s to access their geolocation.65   On May 8, 2020, the contact tracing clause was repealed.66   The direction also requires the South African Post Office to participate in individual tracking and tracing efforts:  The South African Post Office must make available its national address system and any applicable database to assist the relevant authorities identified to track and trace                                                              62 Disaster Management Act No. 57 of 2002, § 27(2)(f), (k), (n) (Apr. 1, 2004), https://perma.cc/4LAU-YMJ2. 63 Regulations Issued in terms of Section 27(2) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002, § 4(10)(c) (Apr. 29, 2020), https://perma.cc/9ZP3-AUF8. 64 Disaster Management Act (57/2002): Electronic Communications, Postal and Broadcasting Directions Issued Under Regulation 10(8) of the Act, Government Gazette (GG) No. 43164, § 8.1 (Mar. 26, 2020), https://perma.cc/GCB6-W5VE.  65 Contact Tracing Will Not Be Used to Spy on Citizens, South Africa Government News Agency (Apr. 2, 2020), https://perma.cc/RJ9A-M7LA.  66 Disaster Management Act (57/2002): Electronic Communications, Postal and Broadcasting Directions Issued Under Regulation 10(8) of the Act, § 8.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 197 individuals that have been infected and such other persons that may have been in direct contact with such infected persons. A database may be correlated with other sources from government and private sector.67  This clause appears to be in force to date.   B. Department of Cooperative Governance ad Traditional Affairs Regulations  The Regulations issued by the Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs include provisions on leveraging technology for contract tracing.68 The Regulations mandate the Department of Health to develop a national database (COVID-19 Tracing Database) “to enable the tracing of persons who are known or reasonably suspected to have come into contact with any person known to or reasonably suspected to have contacted COVID-19.”69 The Database must include various pieces of information, including  (a) the first name and surname, identity or passport numbers, residential address and other address where such person could be located, and cellular phone numbers of all persons who have been tested for COVID-19;  (b) the COVID-19 test results of all such persons; and  (c) the details of the known or suspected contacts of any person who tested positive for COVID-19.70  In addition to the restrictions and oversight discussed below, housing the COVID-19 Tracing Database within the Department of Health probably makes it less likely that the information collected for and stored in the Database will be used for purposes other than contact tracing as compared to those countries where national security agencies are involved in contact tracing.71  1. Testing and Collection of Information  When a person is tested for COVID-19, the following information is collected for submission to the director-general of the Department of Health and inclusion in the COVID-19 Tracing Database:                                                               67 Id.  68 Regulations Issued in terms of Section 27(2) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002, § 8. 69 Id.  70 Id.  71 Sara Wild, Antipoaching Tech Tracks COVID-19 Flare-Ups in South Africa, Scientific American (May 12, 2020), https://perma.cc/GK3J-ZP9C.  \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 198 (a) the first name and surname, identity or passport number, residential address, and cellular phone numbers of the person concerned [tested]; and  (b) a copy or photograph of the passport, driver’s licence, identity card or identity book of the person tested.72    Any laboratory that tests a sample for COVID-19 is also required to report to the director-general the information of the person whose sample it tested and the test results.73 Similarly, the National Institute for Communicable Diseases (NICD) must report to the director-general similar information in its possession and any information regarding the persons with whom a COVID-19 patient may have come into contact.74  In addition, accommodation establishments are required to report to the director-general, for the purpose of inclusion in the COVID-19 Tracing Database, the contact information, such as phone number, address, and identification information, of every person who stays in the establishment during the lockdown.75  2. Location Tracking  The Regulations authorize the director-general to direct electronic communications service providers to report to him or her the following information:  (a) the location or movements of any person known or reasonably suspected to have contracted COVID-19; and  (b) the location or movements of any person known or reasonably suspected to have come into contact, during the period 5 March 2020 to the date on which the national state of disaster has lapsed or has been terminated, with a person contemplated in subparagraph (a).76   Upon receiving the directive, the electronic communication services provider in question “must promptly comply.”77 The director-general is not under an obligation to inform the person whose information is being obtained, used, or disclosed during such activities, but must do so within six weeks from the date of expiration of the national disaster declaration.78 A national state of disaster lapses three months after the date of declaration; however, it may be terminated before that time or extended beyond the three-month window.79                                                                  72 Regulations Issued in terms of Section 27(2) of the Disaster Management Act § 8(6). 73 Id. § 8(7). 74 Id. § 8(8). 75 Id.

Restrictions and Oversight  The information relating to the location and movements of persons described above may only obtained for the period of March 5 through the expiration of the national state of disaster declaration,80 and may only be “obtained, used or disclosed” by authorized persons for the limited purpose of “addressing, preventing or combatting the spread of COVID-19 through contact tracing process.”81 Information relating to the location and movement of such persons must be included in the COVID-19 Tracing Database to the extent it is relevant for the purpose of conducting contact tracing; however, information not included in the Database may only be retained by the director-general for a maximum of six weeks after it was acquired at which time it must be destroyed.82   The director-general must provide a weekly report to the COVID-19 designated judge (a Constitutional Court judge designated to perform this oversight role) “the names and details of all persons whose location or movements were obtained.”83 The designated judge’s oversight authority does not appear to be meaningful while the collection of information and tracking is in progress; however, he or she may make recommendations for changing the applicable regulation or its enforcement to the relevant cabinet members.84 Once the program for collection of information and tracking of persons concludes, the designated judge’s oversight role with regard to the fate of the information collected for the Database is more significant (see below).  The Regulations require that information in the COVID-19 Tracing Database be de-identified within six-weeks of the expiration of the national state of disaster declaration and that all information not de-identified be destroyed.85 De-identified information on the Database may be used for research, study, and teaching purposes only.86  The de-identification process, destruction process relating to the information on the Database, and notification of data subjects is subject to judicial and legislative oversight. The director-general must file a report on the de-identification and destruction process of the information in the Database, as well as the notification of data subjects, to the designated judge.87 The designated judge may “give directions as to any further steps to be taken to protect the right to privacy of those persons whose data has been collected, which directions must be complied with.”88 The director general’s report must also be considered in Parliament.89                                                               80 Regulations Issued in terms of Section 27(2) of the Disaster Management Act, 2002, § 8(11).  81 Id. § 8(11). 82 Id.  83 Id. §§ 8(13) & (14).  84 Id. § 8(15). 85 Id. § 8(17)(a) & (c). 86 Id. § 8(17)(b). 87 Id. § 8(17)(d). 88 Id. § 8(18). 89 Id. § 8(19). \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: South Africa The Law Library of Congress 200 4. Penalties  The Regulations bar unauthorized disclosure of information stored in the Database; a violation of this bar is an offense punishable by a fine, custodial sentence not exceeding six-months, or both.90 The following conduct is also criminalized and subject to the same penalties:  • Failure of accommodation establishments to collect and transmit to the director-general all the required information described above • Obtaining, using, or disclosing relevant information for a purpose other than addressing, preventing, or combating the spread of COVID-19 • Retention of such information for a period longer than authorized by the Regulations • Failure to de-identify or destroy information on the Database as required by the Regulations • Failure of a communications service provider to follow the director-general’s direction to collect and make available location and movement information of persons suspected of having contracted COVID-19 and anyone  suspected of having come into contact with such persons • Failure to adhere to directions of the designated judge regarding the steps that must be taken to ensure the privacy of persons whose information has been collected for the Database91                                                               90 Id. § 14. 91 Id.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 201 United Arab Emirates George Sadek  Foreign Law Specialist    SUMMARY The United Arab Emirate’s (UAE’s) Department of Health, located in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, has launched a new mobile application, called “TraceCovid.” The purpose of the application is to track infected individuals. The UAE does not have one specific law on privacy and data protection. The country has a number of legal instruments to protect the privacy of individuals. These legal instruments include Federal Law No. 5 of 2012 on Combating Cybercrimes, Federal Law No. 3 of 1987 on the Penal Code, and the 1971 UAE Constitution. Federal Law No. 2 of 2019, known as “the Health Data Law,” is the first and only domestic legislation regulating data retention and protecting the privacy of personal health data.   I. Overview   As of May 22, 2020, the total number of diagnosed COVID-19 cases in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) was 26, 898 including 12,755 recoveries and 237 fatalities.1 In response, the UAE’s Department of Health, located in the Emirate of Abu Dhabi, launched a new mobile application, called “TraceCovid.” The purpose of the application is to track infected individuals. The application can be downloaded on both Apple and Android devices. The application uses the Bluetooth function on smartphones and allows users to detect and identify another device with the same application installed.2  According to the Department of Health, if two people are near each other, their mobile phones will exchange an encrypted Secure Tracing Identifier (STI) and store the exchanged STI locally on their phones. If one of them is infected with the virus, the relevant authorities will be able to access the user’s data and timestamps. This will allow the medical authorities to track all the other individuals who have come in close contact with the infected person.3   Many citizens and expatriates of the UAE have no reservations about sharing their data in general, especially with retailers. According to a report by professional services firm KPMG, 78% of UAE consumers are willing to share their personal data with retailers and other institutions. Only about 22% percent are not in favor of disclosing their personal data with any organization at all, according to the same report.4 According to the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority                                                  1 UAE Coronavirus (COVID-19) Updates, UAE Sup.

Legal FrameworkA. Privacy and Data ProtectionThe UAE does not have one specific law on privacy and data protection. The country has a number of legal instruments protecting the privacy of individuals. These legal instruments include Federal Law No. 5 of 2012 on Combating Cybercrimes, Federal Law No. 3 of 1987 on the Penal Code, and the 1971 UAE Constitution.  1. Federal Law No. 5 of 2012The Law penalizes individuals and entities who disclose any information obtained by electronic means, if such information was obtained in an unauthorized manner.6 It also criminalizes the act of using, without authorization, any computer network, website or method of information technology to disclose private information.7  2. Federal Law No. 3 of 1987 on the Penal CodeThe penal code of the UAE sanctions any person who violates the private or family life of other individuals by eavesdropping, recording, or transmitting, through a device of any kind, conversations that took place in a private place or by telephone or any other device, or by capturing or transmitting, through any type of device, a picture of a person in a private place.8  3. The 1971 ConstitutionThe Constitution states that communications by post, telegraph or other means are confidential.9 B. Data Protection and RetentionFederal Law No. 2 of 2019, known as “the Health Data Law,” is the first and only domestic legislation regulating data retention and protecting the privacy of personal health data.10 It also 5 UAE’s Mobile Phone Penetration Rises to 228%, Al-Rasub (May 29, 2017), https://perma.cc/CX9B-DVCR. 6 Federal Law No. 5 of 2012, art. 21, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 540, 13 Aug. 2012, https://perma.cc/WK27-478N. 7 Id. art. 22. 8 Federal Law No. 3 of 1987, art. 378, 12 Aug. 1978, Abu Dhabi Jud.

However, it allows sharing of health data without the permission of the patient under the following circumstances: (1) responding to a request for information issued by insurance companies covering the medical services, (2) for the purpose of adopting public health preventive and treatment measures, (3) to respond to a request for information issued by a judicial authority, and (4) to respond to a request for information about a patient pertaining to the preservation of public health.20    The Law imposes disciplinary actions and fines ranging between one thousand and one million Emirati Dirhams (between US$250 and US$250,000) on health care providers who violate any of its provisions.21                                                    11 Els Janssens & Kellie Blythe, UAE Issues Law to Protect Health Data and Restrict Its Transfer Outside the Country, Baker McKenzie (Mar. 20, 2019), https://perma.cc/AL8D-LXNY.  12 PwC, Health Data Protection in the UAE: A New Federal Law 3 (2019), https://perma.cc/6RFS-YBX8. 13 Federal Law No. 2 of 2019, art. 4(1). 14 Id. art. 4(2). 15 Id. art. 6.  16 Id. art. 8. 17 Id. art. 13. 18 Id. art. 24. 19 Id. art. 20.   20 Id. art. 16. 21 Id. art. 25. \fRegulating Electronic Means to Fight the Spread of COVID-19: United Arab Emirates  The Law Library of Congress 204  III.  Electronic Measures to Fight COVID-19 Spread  On April 19, 2020, the Health Department in Abu Dhabi announced that it had launched a mobile application, called “TraceCovid.” The department has urged all UAE citizens and expatriates to install the application on their mobile devices. The main purpose of the mobile application is to identify any individuals who came close to someone who is a COVID-19 patient.22  According to the main web page of “TraceCovid UAE,” the application authorizes users to detect mobile devices that have the same application installed. To illustrate, when a person is located at a supermarket and comes close to another person whose phone also has TraceCovid installed, the application on both mobile devices exchanges an encrypted STI and stores the exchanged STI locally on their devices. The STI consists of anonymized data and a timestamp. In the event that one of those two people gets the virus, the health department will request that the infected person upload the list of STIs stored locally on that person’s mobile phone. Such information will assist the medical authorities in contacting other people who may have come in close contact with the infected person and identify them faster to minimize the spread of the virus.23   The Abu Dhabi Health Department has announced that the TraceCovid application does not affect the use and efficiency of Bluetooth on a mobile phone. The application runs in the background to communicate with another person’s mobile device that has the same application. The department also said that the privacy of the personal data of the person installing the application is protected.24  The Health Department of Abu Dhabi also launched a second mobile app for individuals who have been identified as COVID-19 patients or who have come in close contact with someone infected with COVID-19. These individuals are ordered to quarantine at home.25   According to the health department, these individuals will be asked to download a mobile app from Google Play or the App Store. The app ensures that the quarantined person adheres to mandatory requirements. The main purpose of the app is to send alerts that inform users to stay within the range of movement allowed during the quarantine. The app provides the health authorities with the precise location of these individuals to ensure that they do not violate the quarantine.26  We were unable to find any information on tracking individuals who do not possess a mobile device.                                                  22 Coronavirus: New App to Help Track Covid-19 Cases in UAE, Nat’l (Apr. 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/A6R7-JTY5. 23 How TraceCovid Works, TraceCovid UAE, https://perma.cc/P6MR-R3HN. 24 Id.  25 Ashwani Kumar, UAE Fights Covid-19: New Self-Quarantine App Launched to Stop Spread, Khaleej Times (Apr. 3, 2020),  https://perma.cc/C35A-46Q5. 26 Id.

Introduction  This report covers the legal and policy frameworks that govern the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) (formerly known as “One Belt One Road”) in select jurisdictions and regions around the globe, namely, China, Cambodia, Djibouti, Egypt, Greece, Kenya, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Pakistan, the Philippines, Portugal, the Russian Federation, Sweden, Switzerland, the United Kingdom (UK), and certain Central Asian, Caribbean, and South American countries. The BRI is a transcontinental investment strategy and program with the aim of promoting economic connectivity and integration in more than 100 countries in Asia, Europe, and Africa through a large set of rail, road, and sea infrastructure projects, energy pipelines, special economic zones, and other areas of cooperation meant to expand China’s economic and political influence. In 2015, the Chinese government issued an official outline of the principles, framework, priorities of cooperation, and cooperation mechanisms of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (which together now are referred to as the BRI).  The report looks at the nature and types of agreements made by these countries, the debt implication of some of the major projects, the extent of involvement of local companies and the amount of job creation, and whether projects have any military or strategic purpose in addition to commercial uses.   II.  Legal and Policy Framework   According to the official BRI portal, China has signed 206 BRI cooperation documents with 140 countries and 32 international organizations. Most of the agreements signed with China take the form of “bilateral cooperation agreements” or Memoranda of Understanding (MoUs). BRI-related MoUs can concern government-to-government agreements involving the Chinese government and the host country government, state entities (including state-owned corporations), or regional organizations.   The international legal framework for the participation of host countries in the BRI can be difficult to review, as the text of most agreements and their precise contents and terms are not publicly available. According to one expert, despite some differences in design, the basic structures of these MoUs are similar.1 These agreements can have paragraphs where parties affirm common objectives and guiding principles of cooperation, areas of cooperation (policy coordination, facilities connectivity, unimpeded trade, financial integration, and people-to-people bonds),                                                  1 Cooperation Agreements and MoUs Under the Belt and Road Initiative, Belt & Road Initiative (Nov. 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/Y2W5-AMKG. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 2 modes and mechanisms of cooperation, methods for resolving differences, and applicable law.2 Cooperation in the agreements can cover a wide range of areas, such as transportation infrastructure development, energy projects, trade and investment promotion, and financial cooperation.    Reports indicate that none of these MoUs is legally binding. For example, the MoU with Italy includes the following paragraph on applicable law:  This Memorandum of Understanding does not constitute an international agreement which may lead to rights and obligations under international law. No provision of this Memorandum is to be understood and performed as a legal or financial obligation or commitment of the Parties. This Memorandum of Understanding will be interpreted in accordance with the legislations of the Parties and as well as [sic] applicable international law and, as for the Italian Party, with the obligations arising from its membership of [sic] the European Union.3  However, according to one expert on the BRI, these agreements allow the parties to “formulate interpretations of certain parts of the agreements” and such interpretations may influence future diplomatic negotiations on more specific areas.4    Due to a lack of public access to most MoUs, reliance must be made on government statements, secondary sources, and media reports for details on most of these agreements. The survey of the Russian Federation and Central Asian countries describes the lack of transparency in BRI-related high-level meetings that result in sets of new agreements in various sectors, while the public is informed only of the titles of the agreements.    The level of involvement and number of investment projects can vary widely between jurisdictions and regions. Some countries might not have published a confirmation of signing an MoU or might deny having signed one. Not all BRI members host BRI projects—some countries sign an MoU to “merely formally endorse BRI as a concept and pledge to cooperate with China to promote the initiative.” As noted in the report on South American countries, whether a country is officially involved can be unclear at times. China, however, uses a pragmatic approach to allow nations that have not officially joined BRI for mainly political reasons to benefit from China’s investments in the region.  Several jurisdictions in Europe surveyed for this report, such as Switzerland and Luxembourg, have limited involvement in the BRI. Switzerland has taken a cautious approach with no major flagship projects and a single BRI MoU focused on financial and economic matters to deepen the “innovative strategic partnership” between Switzerland and China and expand areas of collaboration in trade, investment, and finance for projects in third countries. Luxembourg also does not have any investment infrastructure projects but has signed an MoU on financial services,                                                  2 Gov’t of Italy, Memorandum of Understanding Between the Government of the Italian Republic and the Government of the People’s Republic of China on Cooperation Within the Framework of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative (Mar. 2019), https://perma.cc/NDT4-NA3U.  3 Id. para. VI, Applicable Law. 4 Belt & Road Initiative, supra note 1.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 3 by which it seeks to cement its status as an international financial center—in particular for green finance. In South American countries, concerns and criticism of the BRI involving inefficient legal frameworks, regulatory risks, lack of transparency, Chinese geopolitical interests, and domestic political issues, are commonly cited as obstacles to BRI projects in the region.  The UK has not signed an MoU to participate in the BRI, and it does not have any projects in its territory due to concerns over debt sustainability and China’s compliance with international procurement standards. However, it is involved in the BRI by encouraging UK companies to finance these projects, and it is working to ensure that its economic and strategic interests are not left behind.   China has expressed a desire to create a “Polar Silk Road” transportation route into and through the Polar Region, including the Nordic countries of Finland, Norway, and Sweden, but no initiatives have been implemented in these countries. Sweden, despite being a large recipient of China’s direct investment, is not a part of the BRI, and its government has been reluctant to endorse the initiative or the Polar Silk Road. The Swedish Defense Research Agency has said that Chinese foreign direct investment can have negative consequences for the security of the country.  Other countries have numerous bilateral agreements and other arrangements. Pakistan is heavily involved in the BRI’s flagship project, called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), and signed 51 agreements, MoUs, and financing contracts with China at CPEC’s official launch in 2015. Malaysia signed various MoUs and agreements related to a number of infrastructure projects involving Chinese funding and companies between 2013 and 2017, including eight government-to-government MoUs signed in 2015 and 14 MoUs signed in November 2016.   Agreements and contracts can also involve state governments and Chinese businesses, business-to-business agreements, and other arrangements. Secrecy and a lack of details surrounding financing and project implementation contracts has also characterized many if not most BRI projects. In Kenya and the Philippines, loan agreements for certain projects have nondisclosure clauses, which state that the borrower must keep all the terms and conditions of an agreement strictly confidential. Loan agreements in both countries also include clauses waiving sovereign immunity and mandating arbitration of disputes before the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission in Beijing.    III.  Problems Surrounding Terms and Conditions of Debt Loans    According to a Green Belt and Road Initiative Center analysis, from 2004 to 2019, China’s overseas loans (including in BRI countries and non-BRI countries) grew by almost 12 times, from US$59 billion to US$696 billion. Many of the BRI projects are financed by loans from Chinese financial institutions, such as the China Development Bank and Exim Bank of China. Among these loans, many are lent to, or guaranteed by, BRI country governments.   Debt problems and risks have been associated with many BRI projects in a number of host countries such as Djibouti, Kenya, Pakistan, and Malaysia. Kenya, for example, has 43 loans worth US$9.2 billion, and interest payments to Chinese lenders constituted 87% of the money it used to service its debts in 2019. It is also struggling to generate enough revenue from one of its flagship projects, the standard gauge railway (SGR), to service its debt. Djibouti’s risk of external \fBelt and Road Initiative: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 4 debt distress and overall risk of debt distress is also high, with China holding at least 70% of Djibouti’s debt. Pakistan’s ratio of Chinese debt is lower (27.4%), but CPEC energy power projects may increase Pakistan’s debt burden because of sovereign guarantees, and these projects are currently facing a circular debt problem. However, for countries like Cambodia, although foreign debt has increased, and 44% of such debt was owed to China in 2020, many BRI projects are financed through private corporate investments rather than government-to-government loans, which may reduce the risk of a debt-trap. In Central Asia, the poorest countries of the region, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, are also vulnerable to debt shocks, as they borrow under unfavorable conditions to finance their respective BRI-related infrastructure projects.  Some commentators argue that China is involved in “debt trap” diplomacy, where it is purposefully burdening countries with “unsustainable levels of debt in order to gain control of strategic infrastructure or political influence when borrowing countries can’t repay their loans.”5 One often-cited example of this practice is the Hambontota port in Sri Lanka. Concerns also rose when Kenya was said to have waived its sovereign immunity in a loan agreement, potentially exposing key public assets to seizure by China in the event of a default. However, some observers note that although it is unlikely that China will seize the Mombasa port in the event that Kenya fails to meet its debt obligations, the possibility does give China leverage over Kenyan political decisions. Similarly, in Egypt, there is concern that the country may fail to repay its loans for major infrastructure projects because of the government’s substantial debts, and that this may result in less Chinese investment in the future.   However, although debt appears to be a significant problem associated with BRI projects in a number of host countries, this narrative has been disputed by some commentators as being overly simplistic. With respect to Malaysia, for example,  commentators have argued that problems with BRI-linked projects, including their cost and financing, have arisen due to the influence of domestic interests, politics, and corruption, and that the country is not facing debt distress as a result of the deals.    Many observers are concerned that Djibouti has taken on more debt than it can handle, but some dispute that it has fallen into a “debt trap.” They argue that a number of factors may mitigate against that eventuality, including positive economic prospects, significant reputational cost to China if that happens, and the Djiboutian government’s long experience in leveraging its strategic position to protect its interests. Some observers also note China’s willingness to renegotiate, waive, or restructure loans in some cases. For example, some or all of the above factors may have contributed to China’s willingness to renegotiate with Djibouti regarding its debt in respect to the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. Pakistan also is negotiating with China in order to restructure the terms of energy projects, seeking to cut interest rates on current power sector-related loans and a 10-12 year extension on the debt repayment period.   Other commentators note that, with the focus on debt, not enough attention is drawn toward some of the mutual economic benefits that BRI projects brings to China and the host country. For example, the potential benefits that China seeks from the BRI and that African countries involved                                                  5 Erica Downs, The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Power Projects: Insights into Environmental and Debt Sustainability 34, Columbia U. Ctr. Global Energy Pol’y (Oct. 2019), https://perma.cc/6HVG-HBEU.    \fBelt and Road Initiative: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 5 in the program, including Kenya with the Mombasa–Nairobi SGR, stand to gain from it are not necessarily mutually exclusive. Proponents in Pakistan’s government also criticize the narrow focus on commercial loans when CPEC projects have also been financed through a variety of other structures, such as joint ventures/public-private partnerships, equity financing, grants, and no interest/concessional loans.  In 2019, in response to criticism, China recognized the need to do things differently, a shift that is being described as BRI 2.0. During the second Belt and Road Forum (Second BRF), leaders issued a joint communiqué that stated the BRI would strive to “build high-quality, reliable, resilient and sustainable infrastructure” and recognized a need for more “diversified and sustainable financial supports for projects” from national and international financial institutions.6 President Xi Jinping’s remarks during the forum also emphasized that China would make BRI more financially sustainable. As a result, China’s Ministry of Finance formulated the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative.7 The aim of the framework is to promote sustainable economic and social development of BRI countries while ensuring debt sustainability. It is a nonmandatory policy tool to conduct debt sustainability analysis and manage debt risks to support lending decisions.  IV. Local Companies/Local Job Creation    In some host countries, all major BRI projects appear to be dominated by Chinese companies and state-owned enterprises, sometimes in joint ventures or partnerships with local businesses and other third parties. In Central Asia, for example, BRI projects are predominantly built by Chinese investors and companies, and such projects are disproportionately backed by Chinese state financiers. There has been considerable criticism over corruption and the lack of transparency, due diligence, and competitive bidding/fair procurement practices involved in BRI projects across host countries. For example, in Kenya, the China Road and Bridge Corporation was awarded the contract to build the SGR without open tendering, in disregard of the 2010 Constitution and 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. Similarly, in Pakistan, there were reported irregularities violating procurement rules in the award for highways and motorways projects. In Malaysia, some of the projects and deals have generated controversy and have formed part of the corruption allegations against Najib Razak, the former prime minister who initiated them. A new prime minister sought to renegotiate or terminate some of the significant projects between 2018 and 2020, arguing that they imposed too great a burden on the country, and the former prime minister was subsequently convicted of corruption offenses in 2020. Concerns about potential violations of procurement processes, concessions in respect to local content, and fair labor practices have also been raised in a number of Caribbean countries.    As part of the BRI 2.0, China is putting greater emphasis on transparency and abiding by international rules on bidding and procurement. The joint communiqué of the Second BRF highlighted “the importance of open, transparent and non-discriminatory public procurement                                                  6 Joint Communique of the Leaders’ Roundtable of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, Second Belt & Road F.

Local job creation has been another area of controversy in BRI projects in a number of host countries. In Pakistan, CPEC is expected to add over 700,000 jobs to the Pakistani labor market from 2015 to 2030. Some commentators reported estimates exceeding 2.3 million jobs by 2030. However, it appears that a large portion of the jobs generated by these projects employ unskilled laborers while most skilled opportunities go to Chinese workers. Similarly, in Egypt, although Chinese companies are hiring local Egyptian workers, there is a concern that local employees are underrepresented in the companies’ managerial positions. This may deny the workers the opportunity to gain important knowledge and skills.   V.  Military or Strategic Purposes of Projects   Commentators have written about the potential and actual use of certain BRI-linked ports and other maritime assets for strategic and military purposes, but this is usually downplayed or rejected by the host country and China. A report by the BRI Leadership Group, China’s government coordination body, stresses that the BRI is not a geopolitical or military alliance, but “an initiative for peaceful development and economic cooperation.”  Cambodia and China are suspected of having signed a secret agreement granting China exclusive rights over a certain part of the Ream Naval Base, although both governments deny this. Similarly, the Gwador seaport in Pakistan is often highlighted as an example of a potential or likely site for a Chinese overseas naval base. However, according to available reports, it is not currently being used as a People’s Liberation Army military base, and both governments have downplayed any military use for the port. Some experts note, however, that the port may still serve China’s broader strategic and other policy objectives. In Greece, COSCO Shipping, a state-owned enterprise, has a majority stake in and operates the Piraeus Port Authority, making the Port of Piraeus the first major seaport in the European Union that is wholly managed by a Chinese company, raising strategic concerns among US and European allies. In Portugal, its maritime assets, the Port of Sines and the archipelago of the Azores, have attracted investment and strategic interest from China. In March 2019, President el-Sisi affirmed Egypt’s support of the BRI, and he called for enhanced defense cooperation in August 2020. A Chinese company, Hutchison Ports, has signed a long-term agreement with the Egyptian navy for the development and operation of a new container terminal inside the Abu Qir Naval Base on the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, Djibouti hosts China’s only foreign military base, a naval facility adjacent to the Doraleh Multipurpose Port from which it can participate in anti-piracy operations and generally safeguard its access to the strategic maritime route along the coast of the Horn of Africa.   \f China  \fThe Law Library of Congress 7 China Laney Zhang Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY China has officially stated that the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) “focuses on Asia, Europe and Africa, but is open to all partners,” and that the BRI is not a geopolitical or military alliance, but “an initiative for peaceful development and economic cooperation.” China has so far signed 206 BRI cooperation documents with 140 countries and 32 international organizations, according to the official BRI portal.    China does not appear to have enacted any laws or regulations governing the implementation of BRI projects. The country’s highest court has issued judicial policy documents to support the BRI. The overseeing body of the BRI in China is the BRI Leading Group, and the Office of the Leading Group that manages its day-to-day work is located in the National Development and Reform Commission. Various other ministries and commissions under the State Council are also involved in the formulation and implementation of the BRI. Provinces in China have all set up their own BRI leading groups and issued their BRI implementation plans to complement the national BRI blueprint.   Since 2017, China and 28 other countries have endorsed the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road. In 2019, recognizing “the importance of striking a balance between meeting financing demands, sustainable development and debt sustainability,” the Ministry of Finance formulated the BRI Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative, a non-mandatory policy tool to conduct debt sustainability analysis and manage debt risks to support lending decisions.     I.  Introduction  A. Stated Aims   In 2015, the Chinese government issued an official outline of the principles, framework, priorities, and cooperation mechanisms of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (together now referred to as the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)).1 It states that the BRI aims to promote the connectivity of Asian, European, and African continents and their adjacent seas and establish and strengthen partnerships among the countries along the BRI, as well as to:  set up all-dimensional, multi-tiered and composite connectivity networks, and realize diversified, independent, balanced and sustainable development in these countries. The                                                  1 National Development and Reform Commission, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, & Ministry of Commerce (MOFCOM) of the People’s Republic of China (with State Council authorization), Vision and Actions on the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st-Century Maritime Silk Road (Mar. 2015) (2015 BRI Outline), https://perma.cc/G3MS-AHEA. \fBelt and Road Initiative: China The Law Library of Congress 8 connectivity projects of the Initiative will help align and coordinate the development strategies of the countries along the Belt and Road, tap market potential in this region, promote investment and consumption, create demands and job opportunities, enhance people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual learning among the peoples of the relevant countries, and enable them to understand, trust and respect each other and live in harmony, peace and prosperity.2  In 2019, the Office of the Leading Group on Promoting the Implementation of Belt and Road Initiatives (BRI Leading Group) issued a report on the progress, contributions, and prospects of the BRI (hereinafter “2019 BRI Progress Report”), which states that the BRI “focuses on Asia, Europe and Africa, but is open to all partners.”3 The report also stresses that the BRI is not a geopolitical or military alliance, but “an initiative for peaceful development and economic cooperation.” According to this report, from 2013 to 2018, China’s direct investment in the BRI countries surpassed US$90 billion, “realizing a turnover of US$400 billion in foreign contracted projects in these countries.”4  B. Countries Involved  As of June 2021, 140 countries and 32 international organizations had signed 206 BRI cooperation documents with China, according to the country list provided by China’s official BRI portal.5 The BRI has now extended its reach to all continents:    • 40 countries are in Sub-Saharan Africa,  • 34 countries are in Europe and Central Asia,  • 24 countries are in East Asia and the Pacific,  • 17 countries are in Middle East and North Africa,  • 19 countries are in Latin America and Caribbean, and  • 6 countries are in South East Asia.6   Most of the “cooperation documents” are in the form of memoranda of understanding (MOU). The BRI portal carries press releases announcing the MOUs, while only a limited number of full-text MOUs are available, such as those signed with New Zealand, Poland, and Hungary.7 Some countries on the list may have not published a confirmation of signing a full MOU or denied having signed one, as noted by the Green Belt and Road Initiative Center (GBRIC) of the Central                                                  2 Id. 3 Office of the Leading Group on Promoting the Implementation of Belt and Road Initiatives, The Belt and Road Initiative Progress, Contributions and Prospects (Apr. 22, 2019), https://perma.cc/WG49-9SLR (in Chinese).  4 Id. 5 List of Countries Having Signed Cooperation Documents with China to Jointly Build “Belt and Road,” Belt and Road Portal (updated June 23, 2021), https://perma.cc/VQJ9-FKE3 (in Chinese).  6 Christoph Nedopil, Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative, Green BRI Center, Central University for Finance and Economics (2021), https://perma.cc/W9EP-27GM.   7 List of Countries Having Signed Cooperation Documents with China to Jointly Build “Belt and Road,” supra note 5.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: China The Law Library of Congress 9 University for Finance and Economics in Beijing.8 Furthermore, a Council on Foreign Relations article points out that not all BRI members host BRI projects. According to the article,  [s]ome countries merely formally endorse BRI as a concept and pledge to cooperate with China to promote the initiative. In Italy’s nonbinding MoU with China, for example, the two countries pledged to “work together within the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) to translate mutual complementary strengths into advantages for practical cooperation and sustainable growth.”9  II.  Legal and Policy Framework   A.  BRI Policies of the Supreme People’s Court  China does not appear to have enacted any laws or regulations governing the implementation of BRI projects. Rather, in 2015, the Supreme People’s Court (SPC, China’s highest court) issued a judicial policy document to support the BRI. The document, titled the Opinion on Providing Services and Guarantees for the Belt and Road (SPC Opinion), has been updated once in 2019.10   The SPC Opinion covers a wide range of BRI-related legal issues, including cross-border criminal, civil and commercial, and maritime law, free trade zone-related judicial issues, and judicial review of arbitration. 11 In terms of financial law, the 2019 SPC Opinion states that the SPC will “serve the opening up of the financial sector according to law” and “further regulate and unify the application of foreign-related financial laws.”12 Specifically, the court will study the following legal issues:   • the special construction loans for the Belt and Road, • the Silk Road Fund, • various special investment funds, • Silk Road-themed bonds, and  • multilateral financing and development cooperation and export credit insurance.13                                                   8 Id.  9 David Sacks, Countries in China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Who’s In And Who’s Out, Council on Foreign Relations (Mar. 24, 2021), https://perma.cc/2PBM-XWCS.   10 SPC, Opinions on Further Providing Judicial Services and Safeguards for the Belt and Road Initiative by People’s Courts (Dec. 9, 2019) (2019 SPC Opinion), https://perma.cc/Z9MM-PNPQ (in Chinese).   11 Susan Finder, Supreme People’s Court and “One Belt One Road,” Supreme People’s Court Monitor (July 14, 2015), https://perma.cc/77KZ-E4YE.   12 2019 SPC Opinion, supra note 10. 13 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: China The Law Library of Congress 10 The SPC will also support multilateral financial institutions and financial institutions in various countries to participate in investment and financing of the BRI, according to the 2019 SPC Opinion.14  B.  Institutional Framework   The overseeing body of the BRI in China is the BRI Leading Group, and the Office of the Leading Group that manages its day-to-day work is located in the National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC).15 In addition to the NDRC, various ministries and commissions under the State Council are involved in the formulation and implementation of the BRI policies, such as the Ministry of Commerce, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Ministry of Finance (MOF), and Ministry of Ecology and Environment.16 At the local level, provinces in China have all set up their own BRI leading groups and issued BRI implementation plans to complement the national BRI blueprint.17  Furthermore, the Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission is responsible for approving overseas investments by Chinese banks and oversees China’s insurance industry. The People’s Bank of China, China’s central bank, establishes monetary policy and manages foreign exchange reserves.18 Many financial institutions have also been employed or have emerged to contribute to the goals of the BRI, such as:   • Chinese financial institutions, such as the Silk Road Fund, China Development Bank, and the Exim Bank of China; • Multilateral financial institutions, such as the Asian Infrastructure and Investment Bank and the New Development Bank; and • Commercial banks, such as the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, China Construction Bank, and the Agricultural Bank of China.19  III.  Responses to Criticisms  A.  BRI 2.0 in the Making?  Researchers at the S. Rajaratnam School of International Studies of Singapore’s Nanyang Technological University noted that, at the second Belt and Road Forum China (2d BRF) hosted in April 2019, “China acknowledged the criticisms labelled against the BRI and pledged to reform it a number of ways. If these pledges are implemented, and cooperation with development                                                  14 Id.  15 2019 BRI Progress Report, supra note 3.  16 See Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) Policy Database, GBRIC, https://perma.cc/PC3Y-CTJC.  17 Progress in Integrating China’s Provinces, Autonomous Regions, and Municipalities in the BRI, China Academy of the Belt and Road Initiative (Aug. 30, 2019), https://perma.cc/96BR-DV9Y (in Chinese).  18 Belt and Road Initiative Quick Info, GBRIC, https://perma.cc/N93V-YHAK. 19 Id.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: China The Law Library of Congress 11 partners and stake-holding countries increases, we could see ‘BRI 2.0’ emerging which could lead to a win-win situation for all.”20   At the forum, China’s President Xi Jinping “attached importance to BRI adopting multilateral rules and international best practices pertaining to project development, operation, procurement and tendering and bidding.” 21 He also emphasized that China would make the BRI more financially and environmentally sustainable, including releasing the BRI Debt Sustainability Framework and launching green infrastructure projects, making green investment, and providing green financing.22   The joint communiqué of the leaders’ roundtable of the 2d BRF expressed that BRI will strive to “build high-quality, reliable, resilient and sustainable infrastructure” and need for more “diversified and sustainable financial supports for projects” from national and international financial institutions. The joint communiqué also highlighted “the importance of open, transparent and non-discriminatory public procurement procedures” and “zero tolerance in anti corruption.”23  The 2019 BRI Progress Report, which was released right ahead of the forum, lays out the prospects of the BRI in the future, which “will become a road of peace, prosperity, opening up, green development, innovation, connected civilizations, and clean government.”24 Regarding “clean government,” the 2019 BRI Progress report states that China is willing to join all other countries in improving the legal systems and mechanisms to fight corruption, improving the business environment, and punishing commercial bribery. According to the report:  [c]lean government is the moral principle and the legal red line that we should never cross in Belt and Road cooperation. All participating countries should work together to foster a modern business environment which is corruption-free and efficient, strengthen supervision and management and control risk in Belt and Road projects, and create a public resource market which is procedure-based and transparent. During the tendering, construction, and operational management of a project, we should abide by related laws and regulations, eliminate power rent-seeking, and establish sound market order.25  B.  BRI Financing and Debt Governance  According to a GBRIC analysis, from 2004 to 2019, China’s overseas loans (including BRI countries and non-BRI countries) grew by almost 12 times from US$59 billion to US$696 billion. Many of the BRI projects are financed by loans from Chinese financial institutions, such as the                                                  20 Pradumna Bickram Rana & Xianbai Ji, Belt and Road Forum 2019: BRI 2.0 In The Making?, RSIS (May 2, 2019), https://perma.cc/7LQD-R5VU.  21 Id. 22 Id.  23 Joint Communique of the Leaders’ Roundtable of the 2nd Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation (Apr. 27, 2019), https://perma.cc/VZ9H-Y9F5.  24 2019 BRI Progress Report, supra note 3.  25 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: China The Law Library of Congress 12 China Development Bank and the Exim Bank of China. Among these loans, many are lent to, or guaranteed by, BRI country governments.26  The analysis recommends that Chinese policymakers, among other things, improve debt governance by setting standards for overseas official lending by strengthening debt transparency and develop coherent norms for major official Chinese lenders domestically, while at the international level embracing multilateral mechanisms for lending such as the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank.27  1.  Multilateral Financing   In 2017, China’s MOF and its counterparts in 26 other countries, including Argentina, Russia, Indonesia, and the UK, endorsed the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road (Financing Principles).28 Singapore and Saudi Arabia subsequently endorsed the Financing Principles. 29  The Financing Principles calls upon the governments, financial institutions, and companies from participating countries to work together to build a long-term, stable, sustainable financing system that is well-placed to manage risks.30   According to the 2019 BRI Progress Report, under the Financing Principles, countries participating in the BRI support channeling financial resources to serve the real economy of countries and regions involved, with priority given to such areas as infrastructure connectivity, trade and investment, and industrial cooperation.31 The report goes on to provide examples of China’s multilateral financial cooperation:   The People’s Bank of China has rolled out joint financing programs with the International Finance Corporation under the World Bank Group, Inter-American Development Bank, African Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and other multilateral development institutions. By the end of 2018, these institutions had invested in more than 100 programs in over 70 countries and regions. Established in November 2017, the China-CEEC Bank Consortium includes 14 financial institutions from China, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Croatia, and nine other Central and Eastern European countries. In July 2018, the China-Arab States Bank Consortium was founded, followed by the China-Africa Financial Cooperation Consortium established in September; each was the first multilateral financial cooperation mechanism between China and the respective area.32                                                     26 Mengdi Yue & Christoph Wang, Brief: Public Debt in the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI)—How Covid-19 Has Accelerated an Ongoing Problem of China’s Lending, GBRIC (Dec. 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/MF9K-RB8F.  27 Id.  28 MOF, Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road, Belt and Road Portal (May 16, 2017), https://perma.cc/U6ZU-FESP.  29 Saudi Arabia Became the 29th Country Endorsing the Guiding Principles on Financing the Development of the Belt and Road, MOFCOM (July 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/R3DK-LKS5 (in Chinese).  30 Financing Principles, supra note 28. 31 2019 BRI Progress Report, supra note 3. 32 Id.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: China The Law Library of Congress 13 2.  BRI Debt Sustainability Framework   In 2019, recognizing “the importance of striking a balance between meeting financing demands, sustainable development and debt sustainability,” the MOF formulated the BRI Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative.33   With the aim of promoting sustainable economic and social development of BRI countries while ensuring debt sustainability, the Framework is a non-mandatory policy tool to conduct debt sustainability analysis and manage debt risks to support lending decisions. It was formulated based on the IMF/World Bank Debt Sustainability Framework for Low Income Countries, as well as the national conditions and development stages of BRI countries.34  The authors of a Center for Global Development article commented that the Debt Sustainability Framework follows a shift of Chinese policy makers “from denying any problems with BRI lending to acknowledging the debt risks of large-scale lending and pointing to the need for more disciplined lending.” According to this article,  [t]he good news is that the new DSF [debt sustainability framework] is virtually identical to the World Bank-IMF DSF, which governs lending operations for the multilateral institutions and, to some degree, many bilateral lenders. It would seem then that China’s effort marks a significant step forward in guarding against debt problems associated with BRI.  The bad news is that, content aside, key questions remain about the role of a Belt and Road DSF in relation to the multilateral framework. Depending on how the new DSF is used, it could ultimately represent a step backward when it comes to achieving debt sustainability in low income countries.35  C.  Government Statements  In a press conference on February 23, 2021, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Wang Wenbin responded to a question concerning the debt issue in Africa, saying that there was no African country that had debt difficulties due to its cooperation with China. According to him,    [w]e never press countries having difficulties on debt repayment, not to mention asking them to sign any imparity clauses. In the meantime, China attaches high importance to debt suspension and alleviation in Africa. We are following the consensus reached by Chinese and African leaders and the G20 DSSI and actively responding to Africa’s concerns. We have signed debt relief agreements or reached debt relief consensus with 16                                                  33 MOF, Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative (Apr. 25, 2019), https://perma.cc/5HML-UPPQ.  34 Id. 35 Scott Morris & Mark Plant, China’s New Debt Sustainability Framework Is Largely Borrowed from the World Bank and IMF.

Under the FOCAC framework, China also waived interest-free loans due to mature by the end of 2020 for 15 African countries.36  In response to the question of whether China has military intentions by constructing the Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka, China’s foreign ministry spokesperson Lu Kang said:  The construction of the Hambantota Port represents the aspiration of the successive Sri Lankan governments and its people. China encourages the relevant Chinese enterprises to conduct cooperation on this project with Sri Lanka in accordance with the business principles and on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. The Chinese financial institutions, in light of the needs of the Sri Lankan side, provided support for it to bridge the financing gap. With the advancement of the project, China adjusted the assets allocation despite some diff[i]culties according to the wish of the Sri Lankan side. These moves are all conducive to our commercial cooperation.37   IV. Public Criticisms  A researcher at the UK think-tank Chatham House pointed out that public opinion in China is “a headwind to overseas lending . . . as policymakers and the public have realised China needs to invest more in its health services, which had been tested by the coronavirus pandemic.”38  The Brookings Institution published an article in 2015 analyzing the domestic controversy over China’s foreign aid in Africa, which includes debt forgiveness for least-developed countries. The article notes that most of the domestic criticism originates from the question of whether China, as a developing country itself, should provide such large foreign aid packages or prioritize the welfare of its own people.39                                                      36 Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Wang Wenbin’s Regular Press Conference on February 23, 2021, MOF (Feb. 24, 2021), https://perma.cc/J7LT-93DX.  37 Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang's Regular Press Conference on July 3, 2018, MOF (July 3, 2018), https://perma.cc/8JJ3-XDQ8.  38 Jonathan Wheatley & James Kynge, China Curtails Overseas Lending in Face of Geopolitical Backlash, Financial Times (Dec. 7, 2020) (quoting Yu Jie, senior research fellow on China at Chatham House). 39 Yun Sun, The Domestic Controversy over China’s Foreign Aid and the Implications for Africa, Brookings Institution (Oct. 8, 2015), https://perma.cc/Z5JY-ZFP5.  \f Africa  \fThe Law Library of Congress 15 Djibouti Nicolas Boring Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Djibouti is a small coastal country on the Horn of Africa, with a strategic position on one of the world’s busiest shipping lanes. Chinese President Xi Jinping and Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh signed “bilateral cooperation documents” under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) on September 2, 2018, but Chinese BRI development in Djibouti predates the signing of those documents by at least five years. The legal framework for Djibouti’s participation in the BRI is difficult to assess, as it rests on agreements that are not publicly available. The policy framework, on the other hand, seems easier to understand. China sees Djibouti as a crucial part of its Maritime Silk Road due to its geographic location. Meanwhile, Djibouti sees Chinese investment as providing the opportunity to further enhance its position as a commercial transportation hub and become the “Singapore of Africa.”    The flagship projects of the BRI in Djibouti include the Doraleh Multipurpose Port, the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone, and the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway. The Doraleh Multipurpose Port was inaugurated in 2017 and is the Exim Bank of China financed a large deep-water port representing an investment of between US$580 million and US$590 million, of which 85%. The Djibouti International Free Trade Zone, the first phase of which was inaugurated in 2018, is expected to be the largest of its kind in Africa once completed. It is being built by China Merchants Group and is run jointly by the Djibouti Ports and Free Zones Authority and a subsidiary of China Merchants Group. The first phase represented an investment of US$370 million, of which a loan from the China Development Bank financed US$250 million. The Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway was inaugurated in 2017. It replaces a long-defunct rail line from the 1890s. It is the first rail line in Africa to be entirely electric, and it reduces the travel time between Addis Ababa and the City of Djibouti to about half a day instead of three days by road. The Djiboutian section of the railroad cost US$525 million, almost entirely financed by Chinese loans.   Many observers are concerned that Djibouti has taken on more debt than it can handle, and that it may have gotten into a “debt trap” with China. Djibouti’s public and publicly guaranteed debt is indeed significant, rising to about 71% of Gross Domestic Product in 2018. The World Bank and the International Monetary Fund describe Djibouti’s risk of debt distress as high, and China holds an overwhelming share of that debt. These risks could be mitigated by positive economic prospects, however. Furthermore, some observers believe that China may not be eager for a debt-for-equity swap, as that would come at significant reputational cost and may create the kind of uncertainty and instability that it would prefer to avoid. Additionally, the Djiboutian government has long experience in leveraging its strategic position to protect its interests. Some or all of these factors may have contributed to China’s willingness to renegotiate the debt on the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway. The BRI investment in Djibouti has also been criticized for not bringing many benefits to the local population, and some observers have noted that China’s enthusiasm for large infrastructure projects in Djibouti may be cooling, as some are taking longer than expected to pay off. Nonetheless, the relationship between \fBelt and Road Initiative: Djibouti The Law Library of Congress 16 the two countries is likely to remain strong, as Djibouti is an important part of China’s BRI, and no other country appears able or willing to invest as much as China in Djibouti.   I.  Introduction  Djibouti is a small country on the coast of the Horn of Africa, on the western shore of the Bab-el-Mandeb Strait, which separates the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea. It is bordered by Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Somalia. Djibouti is one of the smallest countries in Africa and has few natural resources and little industry, but its strength lies in its strategic geographic location along some of the world’s busiest shipping lanes.1 It has a modern deep-water port that handles 95% of Ethiopia’s trade and services transshipments to Europe, the Middle East, and Asia.2 A former French colony, Djibouti has longstanding ties to France, which maintains a military presence there, as do the United States, Japan, Italy, Germany, and Spain.3 China also has a military base there—its first overseas base, established in 2017.4  On September 2, 2018, Chinese President Xi Jinping and Djiboutian President Ismail Omar Guelleh met ahead of the Beijing Summit of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation, and signed “bilateral cooperation documents” under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).5 The precise contents of these documents do not appear to be publicly available, but the website of the Djiboutian president’s office states that the leaders signed four agreements: a memorandum of understanding (MOU) officially incorporating Djibouti in the New Silk Road, an agreement by China to donate 100 million Yuan (about US$15.5 million) to support the development of large projects in Djibouti, an agreement regarding the fight against food insecurity, and an agreement to cooperate in the construction of housing and the fight against unemployment.6 The latter provides for the establishment of a professional training center and the building of 500 homes by China.7  While the signing of these agreements marks the official entry of Djibouti as a participant in the BRI, significant Chinese activity in the country in preceding years can only be considered as part of the BRI. Chinese engagement in Djibouti began to accelerate in 2013, when China Merchants Group, which is owned by the Chinese State, acquired a 23.5% ownership stake in Djibouti’s                                                  1 The World Bank in Djibouti, Overview, World Bank (Apr. 19, 2021), https://perma.cc/EX56-YURJ; CIA World Factbook: Djibouti, Cent.

Limited, a subsidiary of China Merchants Group, acquired a stake in a new corporation called Ports of Djibouti S.A., which owns the port of Djibouti and the Doraleh Multipurpose Port.  On January 18, 2016, China and Djibouti signed four agreements on trade, finance, and economic development.9 The first agreement was about the creation of a huge free-trade zone in Djibouti, while the second and third agreements had to do with reinforcing Djibouti’s role as a transshipment and redistribution platform and the creation of a clearinghouse for Djiboutian economic actors. The latter would allow them to settle transactions without needing to convert their currency into US dollars.10 Finally, the fourth agreement set the framework for strategic cooperation to make Djibouti a regional banking and financial center, and it would allow Chinese banks to operate there.11 The Chinese news agency Xinhua explicitly linked these agreements, particularly the agreement regarding transshipment and redistribution and the agreement on banking and financial services, to the development of China’s New Silk Road.12   II.  Legal and Policy Framework   It is difficult to assess the legal framework for Djibouti’s participation in the BRI. As mentioned above, the relevant agreements are not publicly accessible. It is fair to assume that China’s BRI projects in Djibouti are primarily governed by contracts between the relevant Djiboutian authorities and entities such as China Merchants Group and Exim Bank of China. Aside from these, the government-to-government agreements as between Djibouti and China appear to be MOUs. These do not appear to be legally binding.13 However, as some commentators have pointed out, these agreements could be used by China as diplomatic tools to insist that agreements have been reached over certain areas.14  The policy framework, however, seems easier to understand. From China’s point of view, Djibouti’s geographical situation at the entrance to the Red Sea, where approximately 10% of oil exports and 20% of commercial goods pass on their way to and from the Suez Canal, places it at                                                  8 Zach Vertin, Great Power Rivalry in the Red Sea: China’s Experiment in Djibouti and Implications for the United States 9-10, Brookings Inst.

As at least one analyst has described it, “for Djibouti, meanwhile, the aim is clear: like Singapore, harness its unique geography astride a major commercial shipping route to become a global logistics, services, and trans-shipment hub in a world shifting towards Asia and the Indo-Pacific.”19 The Djiboutian government hopes that this, in turn, will greatly improve the country’s economic situation, as described in its “Vision 2035” strategic plan. Among other objectives, “Vision 2035” aims to triple per-capita income by the year 2035, as well as create over 200,000 new jobs in a country currently plagued by an unemployment rate of almost 50%.20  III.

Doraleh Multipurpose Port  The first flagship project was the construction of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port, begun in 2014 and officially inaugurated on May 24, 2017.21 The port is over eight fathoms deep and features a wharf about 4,000 feet long, 12 quay cranes for general cargo, 4 quay cranes of 50 tons each for containers, and an annual capacity of 8.2 million tons.22 The Doraleh Multipurpose Port was largely inspired by the Chinese port of Shenzen, which President Ismaïl Omar Guelleh visited in 2012, and it was built in a record time of 30 months.23 According to at least two reports, it represented an investment of US$580 million, and the Exim Bank of China financed 85%.24 At                                                  15 Max Bearak, In Strategic Djibouti, a Microcosm of China’s Growing Foothold in Africa, Wash.

Djibouti International Free Trade Zone  One of the 2016 agreements between Djibouti and China is about the establishment of the Djibouti International Free Trade Zone (DIFTZ). It will encompass about 18.5 square miles, and it is intended to create an estimated 15,000 permanent jobs.29 The first phase of the DIFTZ was officially inaugurated in 2018, in the presence of the heads of state of Djibouti, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Sudan, and Somalia.30 Located adjacent to the Doraleh Multipurpose Port, this free trade zone is expected to be the largest of its kind in Africa once completed.31 It is being built by China Merchants Group, and it is run jointly by the DPFZA and China Merchants Holding Company, itself a subsidiary of the China Merchants Group.32 The first phase represented an investment of US$370 million, of which a loan from the China Development Bank financed US$250 million.33   C.  Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway  A key element of Djibouti’s transportation infrastructure development is the reconstruction of a railway between Djibouti and Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Construction of this standard gauge rail line began in 2011, and the railway was inaugurated in 2017. It replaces a long-defunct French rail line built in the 1890s.34 It is the first rail line in Africa to be entirely electric, and it reduces travel time between the two cities to about half a day, compared to more than three days by                                                  25 David Styan, China’s Maritime Silk Road and Small States: Lessons from the Case of Djibouti, 29(122) J.

Indeed, this railroad is also the first phase of a more long-term project to create a trans-African rail network that could link the continent’s eastern and western coasts, possibly linking Djibouti to Douala, in Cameroon.38  This line cost US$525 million for the Djibouti section (compared to US$3.4 billion on the Ethiopian side), and was almost entirely financed by Chinese loans.39 At least one source gives a figure of US$514 million in Chinese loans for the railway,40 while another source gives a figure of US$490 million.41  D.  Possible Future Projects  Developers and port authority officials are promoting several other projects, which are estimated to be worth US$11 billion.42 One of these projects involves a complete transformation of Djibouti’s old port into a world-class waterfront development, including a modern business district, a convention center, a marina and cruise terminals, hotels, parks, and retail shopping.43 The bid for this project was won by China Merchants Group, which built the Shenzhen port complex and already holds a 23.5% stake in Djibouti’s port authority.44   Another project is the building of an additional industrial park, port, and free trade complex at Damerjog, about 10 miles south of Djibouti city. Blueprints for that project include facilities for coal-fired power generation, petrochemicals, building materials, desalination, natural gas liquefaction, and oil export.45 This development would also include a rail link and an international quarter with hotels, residential buildings, schools, green spaces, and an office park.46 One of the Damerjog project’s central components is a US$4 billion pipeline that will link the port to a new Chinese-developed natural gas deposit in Ethiopia’s Ogaden region.47                                                  35 Djibouti inaugure à son tour le train rapide qui relie Addis-Abeba, supra note 34. 36 Id. 37 Id.; Vertin, supra note 8, at 11. 38 Djibouti inaugure à son tour le train rapide qui relie Addis-Abeba, supra, note 34. 39 Cabestan, supra note 4, at 732.  40 Id. 41 Citi GPS, China’s Belt and Road at Five, A Progress Report 36 (Dec. 2018), https://perma.cc/2VPC-Q3UR.  42 Vertin, supra note 8, at 11. 43 Id. 44 Id. 45 Id. 46 Id. 47 Id. at 12. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Djibouti The Law Library of Congress 21 Both of these projects appear to be on hold, and it is unclear whether they will actually proceed. An analysis published by the Brookings Institution states that “in the short term, the risks of further debt accumulation means these two transformational projects are unlikely to get off the ground.”48 Additionally, other domestic constraints raise doubts as to the realization of such grand designs—including “prohibitively high utility costs, an arid climate, searing temperatures, and the lack of a domestic labor force.”49   IV.  Public Support/Criticisms; Assessment of Projects’ Impact  A.  “Debt Trap” Fears    Many observers are concerned that Djibouti has taken on more debt than it can handle, and that it may have gotten itself into a “debt trap” with China. According to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Djibouti’s public and publicly guaranteed debt rose from 34% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) in 2013 to about 71% in 2018.50 A May 2020 World Bank–IMF sustainability analysis describes Djibouti’s risk of external debt distress and overall risk of debt distress as high.51 Moreover, China holds an overwhelming share of that debt: One news article states that China holds more than 70% of Djibouti’s debt.52 Another quotes Djibouti’s foreign affairs minister as admitting the country’s debt to China is equal to 71% of Djibouti’s GDP.53 Some observers believe this threatens the small country’s sovereignty and that Djibouti could suffer the same fate as Sri Lanka, which was forced to cede control of key infrastructure to Chinese companies because it was unable to repay its loans.54 Djibouti’s nationalization of the Doraleh Container Terminal (discussed in Section IV.B. below) has bolstered some of these fears.  Fears that Djibouti is caught in a debt trap could be mitigated by several factors, however. One is that Djibouti’s economic prospects are quite positive, even taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent World Bank estimates predict that “output growth is set to reach 5.5% in 2021 and average 6.2% over 2022 and 2023, as free zone re-exports, as well as economic activity in, and exports of, transportation, logistics, and telecommunication services to Ethiopia rebound.”55 While Djibouti is vulnerable to knock-on effects of a more protracted economic slump in Ethiopia, its “ongoing infrastructure projects, such as the construction of a ship repair yard, a new oil jetty at the Port of Damerjog and a new hospitality infrastructure are also expected to                                                  48 Id. 49 Id. citing Styan, supra note 25.  50 Press Release No. 19/383, IMF, IMF Executive Board Concludes 2019 Article IV Consultation with Djibouti (Oct. 23, 2019), https://perma.cc/92TU-HLMF.  51 Joint World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis, Int’l Dev.

For example, the revenue from the Doraleh Multipurpose Port has proven sufficient to service its own debt.57  Furthermore, the Chinese government may not be as eager to engineer a debt-for-equity swap as some observers fear. The takeover of Sri Lanka’s Hambantota port came at significant reputational cost, which China may wish to avoid repeating.58 Moreover, “default in Djibouti could yield the kind of uncertainty and instability Beijing would prefer to avoid,” and “it might also complicate relations with Ethiopia, who as a regional and continental leader, would be hard pressed to countenance such a move in its backyard.”59  Additionally, the Djiboutian government has long experience in leveraging its strategic location to its benefit, as illustrated by the fact that several nations have military bases there. Djibouti earns an estimated US$125 million a year in rents from the United States, China, France, Japan, and Italy combined.60 In addition to this income, Djibouti sees these bases as a guarantee of its sovereignty.61 Thus, “Djibouti’s power and influence is disproportionately greater than the state’s small size and ostensibly ‘dependent’ roles would suggest.”62  Some or all of these factors may have contributed to China’s willingness to renegotiate loans with Djibouti. Indeed, both Djibouti and Ethiopia appear to have obtained a significant restructuring of the debt by which the Addis Ababa–Djibouti Railway was financed, with an extension of repayment periods from 10 to 30 years.63  B.  Doraleh Container Terminal  The idea that Djibouti may have gotten into a “debt trap” with Beijing has been fueled by the nationalization of the Doraleh Container Terminal, a move by which China Merchants Group ended up obtaining a minority stake in this important asset.  Located just east of the Doraleh Multipurpose Port, the Doraleh Container Terminal has been described as the “crown jewel” of the country’s port complex and is its greatest source of revenue.64 Contrary to the other projects mentioned here, China was not directly involved in its construction. It was designed, built, and operated by the United Arab Emirates conglomerate DP                                                  56 Id. 57 Vertin, supra note 8, at 11. 58 Id. at 15. 59 Id. 60 Andres Schipani, Djibouti’s Port Dream to Become the “Singapore of Africa”, Fin.

This fact has led to reports that China was taking over the Doraleh Container Terminal, and DP World has sued China Merchants Group for allegedly inducing the breach of contract.72 In remarks delivered at the Heritage Foundation in December 2018, US National Security Advisor John Bolton claimed “soon, Djibouti may hand over control of the Doraleh Container Terminal, a strategically-located shipping port on the Red Sea, to Chinese state-owned enterprises.”73   However, some sources view these allegations with skepticism, and the Djiboutian government has repeatedly insisted that it had no interest in turning the container terminal over to China.74 Management of the container terminal appears to be Djiboutian, only a handful of the approximately 700 employees are Chinese nationals, and on-site technology appears to be primarily of European and American manufacture.75 Furthermore, at least one analysis                                                  65 Id. at 14. 66 Id. 67 Id. at 28, endnote 106. 68 Id. at 14. 69 Id. 70 Id.; Djibouti Seizes Control of Dubai-Run Doraleh Port, Al Jazeera (Feb. 24, 2018), https://perma.cc/NS7W-65MC.  71 Doraleh Container Terminal Battle Continues, Port Strategy (July 31, 2019), https://perma.cc/U5H8-7KQS.  72 Vertin, supra note 8, at 14; Costas Paris, China Tightens Grip on East African Port, Wall Street J.

The notion promptly gained traction in the West, was subsequently challenged by analysts and scholars, and today remains a topic of considerable debate. As such, the potential reputational costs of an outright debt-for-port swap likely outweigh the gains of assuming control, at least under current circumstances.   Second, default in Djibouti could yield the kind of uncertainty and instability Beijing would prefer to avoid. It might also complicate relations with Ethiopia, who as a regional and continental leader, would be hard pressed to countenance such a move in its backyard. In this, what’s good for Djibouti—a successful transition in Ethiopia leading to continued economic growth—is good for China. Beijing’s willingness to forgive or renegotiate major loans with both countries in recent years lends some credence to this argument.76  Nonetheless, the same analyst notes, “while a leveraged asset seizure is unlikely in peacetime, debt could be leveraged not for outright control but for preferential access or desirable advantages in other sensitive sectors. US strategists maintain, moreover, that Beijing’s debt-for equity calculations could change in a conflict scenario.”77  C.  Lack of Benefits to Local Population  Beyond questions of debt, BRI development in Djibouti has come under criticism for not bringing many benefits to the local population. For example, some observers have noted that the Doraleh Multipurpose Port seems “mainly outward-looking,” and has done little for local employment while Chinese companies have been its main beneficiaries.78 Meanwhile, it appears that China’s enthusiasm for large infrastructure endeavors in Djibouti is cooling, as some projects are taking longer than expected to pay off.79 Nonetheless, the relationship between Djibouti and China is likely to stay strong, as Djibouti remains an important part of China’s BRI, and no other country appears able or willing to invest as much in the small nation.80                                                   76 Id. 77 Id. 78 Siebt, supra note 15. 79 Id. 80 Id.; Bearak, supra note 15. \fThe Law Library of Congress 25 Egypt  George Sadek  Foreign Law Specialist    SUMMARY In January 2016, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with China to promote the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).     China’s BRI is in line with Egypt’s development goals. China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi stated that China’s BRI and Egypt’s 2030 Vision have joint economic targets. Accordingly, the cooperation between China and Egypt covers different fields, including the production of renewable energy, electric cars, and transport. Egypt utilizes legal and policy frameworks to enhance the cooperation with China. The legal framework takes the form of laws and presidential and cabinet decrees. The policy framework encompasses the forging of partnerships with Chinese entities to carry out infrastructure projects in Egypt as well as signing MOUs.   Two of the main Egyptian flagship projects under BRI are the Suez Canal Economic Zone and the central business district of the new administrative capital. China is the largest investor in the development of Egypt’s Suez Canal Economic Zone. The Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area, a Chinese corporation, carries out the work in the Economic Zone project. Additionally, the China State Construction Engineering Corporation carries out the construction projects in Egypt’s new administrative capital.    Egyptian infrastructure projects funded by Chinese investments have social, political, and economic impacts. These projects face some criticism. It is important to note that Chinese investments in Egyptian infrastructure projects were unable to curb the wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in Egypt in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.     Despite the ongoing cooperation between Egypt and China and the growing Chinese investments in Egypt over the past five years, the Egyptian government has imposed an anti-dumping duty on a number of imported Chinese products.   In addition to Egypt, China had signed a number of MOUs with other countries of the Middle East and North Africa region under the BRI.      I.  Introduction  When China proposed the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, Egypt was one of the first countries to join. In January 2016, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi signed a memorandum \fBelt and Road Initiative: Egypt  The Law Library of Congress 26 of understanding (MOU) with China to promote the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).1 According to Professor Degang Sun, an international studies scholar at Fudan University in Shanghai, China, Egypt is the hub of China’s Middle Eastern political and economic policies. Additionally, Lucille Greer, a scholar of China and the Middle East at the Wilson Center in Washington, DC, argues that Egypt’s stability in comparison to other countries in the region has caused China to invest more in projects specific to Egypt.2   In recent years, Egypt and China have enhanced their economic cooperation. China has used its close relationship with Egypt to advance the BRI, and Egypt has considered China a crucial partner in improving the Egyptian economy.3 In December 2014, China’s President Xi Jinping and President el-Sisi signed a joined statement on establishing a strategic partnership between their countries. The two presidents pledged that the partnership would include political, economic, military, cultural, and technological cooperation, along with cooperation on regional and international affairs.4   Since then, President el-Sisi has visited China six times and signed at least 25 bilateral agreements. For instance, in September 2017, during his visit to China, President el-Sisi signed US$11.2 billion worth of investment projects that included an electric train connecting the planned new Egyptian administrative capital with Cairo. During a visit to Egypt in January 2016, President Xi signed US$15 billion worth of investment projects, including Chinese investment in the infrastructure of the new administrative capital.5  During the first 11 months of 2020, China’s total exports to Egypt reached US$12.06 billion, registering an annual increase of 12.2%, according to the Chinese Embassy in Egypt. According to the Chinese Ministry of Commerce, from January to September 2020, China’s direct investment in Egypt totaled US$89.33 million, up 19.3% from the previous year. China’s total investment in Egypt has exceeded US$7.7 billion. In recent years, China’s government and financial institutions have provided more than US$7.5 billion in loans and credit to Egypt.6                                                      1 China, Egypt Sign MoU on Boosting Cooperation Under Belt and Road Initiative, China Daily (Jan. 21, 2016), https://perma.cc/H6DK-9USJ; see also Hisham AbuBakr Metwally, Egypt Boosts Its Prospects by Joining Belt and Road (Dec. 19, 2019), China Daily, https://perma.cc/4E5H-QQXT. 2 Sean Mathews, The Competition for Egypt: China, the West, and Megaprojects, Al Jazeera, (Mar. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/2QKF-S2YB.  3 John Calabrese, Towering Ambitions: Egypt and China Building for the Future, Middle East Inst.

Legal & Policy Framework   China’s Foreign Minister Wang Yi has stated that China’s BRI and Egypt’s 2030 Vision have joint economic targets. Accordingly, the cooperation between China and Egypt covers different fields, including the production of renewable energy, electric cars, and transport.7   Egypt utilizes legal and policy frameworks to enhance its cooperation with China. The legal framework takes the form of laws and presidential and cabinet decrees. The policy framework encompasses the forging of partnerships with Chinese entities to carry out infrastructure projects in Egypt, as well as signing MOUs.  A.  Legal Framework   1.  Investment Law No. 72 of 2017  Law No. 72 of 2017 grants an array of privileges to foreign companies investing and working in Egypt. One of those privileges is a foreign company’s ability to hire its own country’s citizens as part of the workforce of the investment project that it carries out in Egypt. The law stipulates that an investing foreign company has the right to employ foreign workers as up to 10% percent of its workforce. In the absence sufficient qualified national labor, the percentage can be increased to 20%.8  2.  Presidential Decrees   Egypt’s president has issued a number of decrees approving economic cooperation agreements with China, as well as Chinese loans and funding for different investment projects. For instance, Presidential Decree No. 21 of 2019 approves Chinese funding and development for a distance-learning program to be carried out in three stages.9 In addition, Presidential Decree No. 496 of 2018 approves a Chinese long-term loan of CNY4.6 billion (about US$716 million).10 Likewise, Presidential Decree No. 156 of 2016 approves an agreement signed in Beijing on June 29, 2015, concerning the establishment of the Asian Investment Bank in Egypt to invest in infrastructure.11                                                      7 Alaa Thabet, China Stretches Its Belt to Meet Egypt’s 2030 Vision, Al-Ahram (Jan. 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/J78U-DRX2. 8 Law No. 72 of 2017, art. 8, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 21 bis (c), 31 May 2017, https://perma.cc/5ZHB-AFFM (in Arabic).  9 Presidential Decree No. 21 of 2019, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 36, 5 Sept. 2019, https://perma.cc/3MXT-T8H4 (in Arabic). 10 Presidential No. 496 of 2018, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 19, 9 May 2018, https://perma.cc/KQ7S-AXWE (in Arabic).  11 Presidential Decree No. 156 of 2016, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, 2 Dec. 2017, https://perma.cc/BJ8L-WRP9 (in Arabic).  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Egypt  The Law Library of Congress 28 3.  Ministerial Unit on China   Egypt’s cabinet issued Decree No. 1659 of 2014 on September 16, 2014, establishing the Ministerial Unit on China. The main function of the unit is to monitor and enhance the bilateral relationships between Egypt and China in various fields. The unit meets at least once a month or whenever the need arises. The unit consists of the ministers of Industry, Trade and Small and Medium Enterprises; Petroleum and Mineral Resources; Electricity and Renewable Energy; Foreign Affairs; International Cooperation; Agriculture and Land Reclamation; Transport; and Investment; and the director of the Egyptian General Intelligence Services.12   B.  Policy Framework  This report does not cover every specific agreement between China and Egypt as part of the BRI, as there are many. However, it focuses on the most important MOUs signed between both countries and their joint infrastructure projects.   1.  Vaccine Cooperation and Manufacturing   In December 2020, Egypt’s Ministry of Health and China’s Ambassador to Egypt Liao Liqiang signed an MOU to enhance cooperation in providing COVID-19 vaccine doses offered by the Chinese pharmaceutical company called “Sinopharm.”13 In April 2021, Chinese biopharmaceutical company Sinovac signed an agreement to manufacture Sinovac COVID-19 vaccines in Egypt.14   2.  Renewable Energy  In May 2018, Egypt’s Ministry of Military Production and the Chinese GCL Group signed an MOU for building a solar panel facility that would cost US$2 billion.15 Furthermore, China news agency (Xinhua) announced in March 2019 that China’s renewable energy company TBEA Sunoasis has finished the construction of three solar power stations in the governorate of Aswan, south of Cairo.16                                                     12 Ministerial Resolution No. 1659 of 2014, al-Jarīdah al-Rasmīyah, vol. 37 bis (a), 16 Sept. 2014, https://perma.cc/E947-PCM8 (in Arabic). 13 Egypt’s Health Ministry, Chinese Amb.

Production of Electric Cars   In June 2020, Egypt’s state-owned El Nasr Automotive Manufacturing Company and China’s Dongfeng Motor signed an agreement to produce electric cars for the first time in Egypt. According to the agreement, El Nasr Automotive is supposed to produce 25,000 electric cars per year.17  4.  Building a High-Speed Rail Line  The Egyptian newspaper Al-Masry Al-Youm announced on September 5, 2020, that an Egyptian-Chinese consortium between the Chinese company Samcrete and the Arab Organization for Industrialization had won the bid to build a high-speed rail project, at a cost of US$9 billion. The rail line will run from the Red Sea town of Ain Sokhna through the new administrative capital to the Mediterranean town of El-Alamein, covering 543 kilometers and operating at speeds up to 250 kilometers per hour.18  5.  Defense Cooperation  In March 2019, Xinhua announced that President el-Sisi affirmed Egypt’s support of the BRI. The news agency reported that el-Sisi also expressed his hope that both countries would be able to enhance cooperation further in the fields of counterterrorism, joint military drills, and armed forces buildup as well as the defense industry.19 In August 2019, an Egyptian Armed Forces spokesperson announced that Egyptian and Chinese naval forces launched joint military drills in the Mediterranean Sea. The naval exercise comes as a part of a plan to boost military cooperation between the countries.20 Finally, in August 2020, the Chinese company Hutchison Ports signed a long-term agreement with the Egyptian Navy for the development and operation of a new container terminal that will cost US$730 million. The terminal will be located inside the Abu Qir Naval Base on the Mediterranean Sea.21                                                     17 Ahmed Elleithy, Chinese Automaker to Produce Electric Cars in Egypt, Al-Monitor (June 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/MSK5-T798. 18 Egyptian-Chinese Consortium Wins Bid to Construct Egypt’s First Electric High-Speed Rail, Al-Masry Al-Youm (Sept. 5, 2020), https://perma.cc/BR7E-E58Q. 19 China, Egypt to Further Enhance Defense Cooperation, Xinhua (Mar. 26, 2019), https://perma.cc/43N9-KQ8V.  20 Egypt and China Launch Joint Military Drill, Egypt Daily News (Aug. 22, 2019), https://perma.cc/CC7R-2WD7. 21 Hutchison Ports and Egyptian Navy Collaborate to Build US$730m Container Terminal, Container Mgmt.

Suez Canal Economic Zone   Based on a report issued by Global Construction Review in June 2015, Egypt announced that it would seek China’s funding for the development of the Suez Canal because the canal has already been incorporated into the route of China’s “Maritime Silk Road.”22   According to a statement issued to Xinhua by the director of the Suez Canal Economic Zone (SCZone), by March 2017, China had become the SCZone’s largest investor in its development. The Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA), a Chinese corporation, has established the China-Egypt Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone with the Egyptian government. The company has increased the number of its development projects and tenant factories in the Ain Sokhna district of the Suez Canal Corridor east of Cairo. Furthermore, TEDA is developing a 7.23 square kilometers industrial zone at Ain Sokhna. It has completed its first phase, attracting some 68 enterprises, including Jushi, a “fiberglass giant” from China.23  In 2018, another Chinese company, called “Harbour Excavation” contributed to the development of the Suez Canal by constructing a container terminal in the Port of Damietta, north of the canal. In the same year, the company also began building a second terminal basin in the Sokhna Port south of Suez on the Red Sea.24  In December 2019, the SCZone director held a meeting with a Chinese delegation at the TEDA Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone to discuss Chinese investment in multiple projects, including the textile, petrochemical, and plastics industries. Those investment projects are supposed to take place in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and create 20,000 jobs.25  By the end of 2020, the China–Egypt Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone had attracted 96 enterprises and investment of more than US$1.25 billion. With sales revenue exceeding US$2.5 billion, the businesses in the zone have paid more than US$176 million in taxes and provided about 4,000 direct jobs and 36,000 employment opportunities in related industries.26 We were unable to find any information that would indicate that the SCZone is suffering any financial problems or debt issues.                                                      22 China to Fund $10bn Worth of Egyptian Infrastructure Schemes, Global Construction Rev.

New Administrative Capital  Under the BRI, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC) carries out the construction projects in Egypt’s new administrative capital.27 The new administrative capital is located 45 kilometers east of Cairo and is supposed to accommodate a population of 5 million people. Additionally, it is supposed to include all the buildings of the executive branch of the government as well as a new building for the legislative branch (parliament).28   In October 2017, China State Construction Energy Corp (CSCEC) signed a US$3 billion deal to build a central business district in the new capital, including Africa’s tallest tower.29 In January 2020, the general manager of CSCEC, Chang Weicai, announced that the company would deliver all buildings in the central business district in 2022.30 CSCEC has hired Egyptian and Chinese workers to complete the project.31 As previously mentioned, the Egyptian investment law grants the right to CSCEC to hire Chinese workers for up to 10% of its workforce. That percentage increases to 20% if CSCEC cannot locate Egyptian workers with sufficient qualifications.  Chinese bank loans cover 50% to 70% of upfront costs of the construction of the new administrative capital. The total cost of the project will reach US$45 billion, and the interest rates on the loans are about 2% to 3%. Repayment of the loans began in late 2019 and early 2020, based on grace periods of 36 to 42 months. Egypt’s portion of the project costs are to be funded by selling land in the new capital to property developers. This arrangement drew criticism from a financial reporter, who stated “It is easy to imagine a worst case scenario for the government, where recession hits Egypt in 2019, property developers go bust in the new capital, relocation rates dwindle, and the government has trouble paying back China in 2020, and beyond.”32  Based on a report issued in January 2020 by Al-Monitor, funding problems continue to plague the plans of the Egyptian government to construct the new administrative capital. Despite the US$3 billion deal offered by China to fund the construction of the central business district located in the new administrative capital, Al-Monitor reported, the insistence of Chinese banks on payment guarantees obstructed disbursement of the US$834 million first portion of the loan. The report stated that China has concerns about whether Egypt is capable of repaying the loan. Al-Monitor claims Egyptian Minister of Housing Assem el-Gazzar failed to reveal to Chinese banks the                                                  27 Feature: Chinese Construction Projects in Egypt’s New Capital City Model for BRI-Based Cooperation, Xinhua (Mar. 18, 2019), https://perma.cc/PMS2-ZD22. 28 Egypt’s New Administrative Capital Project Timeline and What You Need to Know, Global Construction Rev.

Assessment of Projects’ Impact; Public Support/Criticism   A.  Projects’ Impact   1.  Social Impact   According to a report by the Egyptian Independent, in January 2020, Chinese Consul General in Alexandria Zhao Liying announced that over 1,560 Chinese companies have provided more than 30,000 job opportunities in Egypt.34 Chinese companies operating in Egypt also donated a EGP1 million (about US$63,700) to the Egyptian Society for Integrated Development, a foundation in charge of preparing food boxes filled with staples and conducting other charitable activities. Bian Shiyuan, head of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce in Egypt, has stated that Chinese companies operating in Egypt are very pleased to take part in this kind of activity to show their commitment to Egyptian society.35  2.  Political Impact   In a news article, Lisa Blaydes, a professor of political science at Stanford University, was quoted as saying “Chinese investments in Egyptian infrastructure have the potential to support the el-Sisi regime in a way that insulates the leadership from popular pressure.” Blaydes added that the newly constructed administrative capital reduces pressure on the need to upgrade Cairo’s crumbling infrastructure. It also protects the government from existing urban populations that have shown a willingness to engage in protests.36  According to the same article, Samuel Ramani, an international relations researcher at Oxford University, asserted that President el-Sisi views the Suez Canal Economic Zone, which is China’s largest investment in Egypt, as an even more significant legacy project than the construction of the new administrative capital. Ramani also said: “[The] strategic importance of this project is further augmented by Egypt’s desire to be a Mediterranean, African and Middle Eastern power and Chinese officials have pitched the Suez Canal investments in a manner that satisfies these objectives.”37                                                     33 Ahmed Youness, Egypt Faces More Delays in Funds to Build New Capital, Al-Monitor (Jan. 28, 2020), https://perma.cc/L9U9-2QLT.  34 Chinese Companies Provide Over 30,000 Job Opportunities in Egypt: Diplomat, Egyptian Indep.

Economic Impact   Economic expert Walid Gaballah, a member of the Egyptian Association for Political Economy, claims that the BRI is pumping huge investments into countries along the old Silk Road to create more jobs and achieve more economic growth. Gaballah has added that the BRI has consolidated Egypt’s partnership with Chinese companies in implementing mega projects such as the central business district in the new administrative capital, solar power stations, and a project to establish an integrated Chinese textile city in Sadat City. Such mega projects aim at boosting the Egyptian economy to unprecedented levels. For instance, Chinese investment in Sadat City will establish more than 500 factories and create 160,000 job opportunities for the local Egyptian population.38 In 2019, Ambassador Liqiang said in an interview with state media that Beijing’s investments in Egypt had reached nearly US$7 billion, representing a 90% increase over a period of five years.39  B.  Criticism   Chinese infrastructure projects in Egypt have faced criticism. According to an article by Mordechai Chaziza, a scholar specializing in China’s foreign and strategic relations, the mega infrastructure projects funded by China in Egypt have had limited results so far. This is due to Egypt’s economic weakness and governance problems, according to Chaziza. He also argues that this will lead Chinese companies investing in Egypt to devote fewer resources in the future.40   In addition, Chaziza claims that China and Chinese companies will not recklessly throw resources into Egypt’s mega infrastructure projects if they think that Egypt will fail to repay their loans because of the Egyptian government’s substantial debts. Chaziza concludes his article by stating that the Chinese projects in Egypt are not growing rapidly despite the extensive cooperation between both countries and contrary to what many news stories imply.41  The Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy (TIMEP), a think tank located in Washington, DC, also criticizes the Egyptian mega projects funded by China. In a study published in November 2019, TIMEP argues that these mega projects pose a strain on Egypt’s macro economy. According to TIMEP, it is unclear whether the projects in which China has invested will advance Egypt’s long-term strategic economic interests. Additionally, TIMEP claims that although Chinese companies operating in Egypt hire Egyptian workers, there is a concern throughout Africa that local employees are underrepresented in the companies’ managerial positions. This may deny the workers the opportunity to gain important knowledge and impede skills transfer.42                                                   38 Interview: BRI Boosts Chinese Investments in Egypt, Says Expert, Xinhua (Oct. 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/Y64N-SP4X. 39 Sean Mathews, The Competition for Egypt: China, the West, and Megaprojects, Aljazeera (Mar. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/YH6Y-5KWP. 40 Mordechai Chaziza, Egypt in China’s Maritime Silk Road Initiative: Relations Cannot Surmount Realities, in China’s Maritime Silk Road Initiative, Africa, and the Middle East 255 (J.M.F.

Anti-China Sentiment   Chinese investments in Egyptian infrastructure projects were unable to curb the wave of anti-Chinese sentiment in Egypt during the COVID-19 pandemic. Chinese and Asian expatriates have faced harassment by some Egyptians in the wake of the pandemic. For instance, a Chinese individual purposely was left stranded on Cairo’s Ring Road highway as individuals avoided helping him. Another Chinese individual sitting in the back seat of a car was forced out of the car because he was holding tissues against his nose and mouth. In a third incident, Henry Woo, an Asian expatriate, was walking through City Stars Mall when a group of Egyptians yelled ”corona” at him.43  During anti-China sentiment in the wake of the pandemic, an Egyptian attorney announced that he would sue Chinese President Xi, asking China to pay US$10 trillion in damages caused by COVID-19 in Egypt,44 prompting Ambassador Liqiang to ridicule the lawsuit.45      China has tried to win the hearts of Egyptians by donating 300,000 doses of a Chinese COVID vaccine called “Sinopharm.” The Chinese ambassador to Egypt announced that the donation of the vaccines was due to the comprehensive strategic partnership and mutual assistance between the two countries.46   D.  Anti-Dumping Policies Against Chinese Products   Despite the ongoing cooperation between Egypt and China and the growing Chinese investments in Egypt over the past five years, the Egyptian government has imposed an anti-dumping duty on a number of imported Chinese products. For instance, the minister of trade issued Ministerial Resolution No. 40 of 2018 to impose an anti-dumping duty of 11% on imports of tires for buses and trucks from Chinese company Prinx Chengshan (Shandong) Tire Company Ltd.47 Also, according to a news report issued in July 2020, the Egyptian Trade and Industry Ministry announced that will maintain the 55% to 74% anti-dumping duties on synthetic fiber blankets imported from China until August 2025.48 In addition, according to a news article published on the official website of the Arab Iron and Steel Union, the Ministry of Trade and Industry decided                                                  43 Sarah Ahmed, In the Wake of COVID-19, Egypt’s Asians Fall Victim to Racism, Egyptian Streets (Apr. 15, 2020), https://perma.cc/BP6F-7N7T. 44 Egyptian Lawyer to Sue China for $10 Trillion over Coronavirus Damages, Daily Sabah (Apr. 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/L8CA-5A77. 45 Chinese Ambassador to Cairo Slams Calls for Chinese Compensation over Coronavirus, Egypt Indep.

Chinese Cooperation with Other Countries in MENA Region    In addition to Egypt, China had signed a number of MOUs with other countries in the MENA region to advance BRI projects. For example, China signed MOUs with North African countries, such as Algeria,50 Libya,51 Morocco,52 and Tunisia.53 China also signed MOUs with other Arab countries of the Middle East, including Bahrain,54 Lebanon,55 Oman,56 and the UAE.57  In North Africa, China is particularly involved in investments in Morocco and Algeria. In 2017, China announced an investment of US$11 billion in the construction of the “King Mohamed VI Tangier Tech City” in Morocco. The new city is projected to provide 100,000 new job opportunities. In February 2018, Morocco and China expressed a mutual interest in expanding economic partnerships following the sixth session of the Morocco-China Joint Committee for Economic Cooperation.58 Chinese companies have invested in construction in Morocco, including the Noor 2 and Noor 3 solar parks.59 The Noor Power Plant in Morocco is the world’s largest concentrated solar power plant complex.60                                                    49 Arab Iron & Steel Union, Egypt Imposes Anti-Dumping Duties on Imports of Ferrosilicon Alloys from India, China and Russia (Apr. 8, 2021), https://perma.cc/5VZG-7UJQ. 50 Algeria Inks MoU on Adherence to China’s ”Belt and Road“ Initiative, Algeria Press Serv.

Algeria is the top exporter of oil and petroleum to China.61 According to a study published by the Middle East Institute, political turmoil in Algeria has prevented China from investing in mega projects infrastructure. For example, in 2017, there were plans to construct a new deep-water port at El Hamdania in Cherchell, with US$900 million of the financing coming from a 20-year loan from the African Development Bank and the remainder from a consortium of Chinese banks. China Harbor Engineering was supposed to manage the port’s operations for the first 25 years. However, work on the project was suspended in April 2019 because of the Hirak protest movement that caused the resignation of Algeria’s President Abdelaziz Bouteflika. In July 2020, after a new government took over, it decided to reach out to China to resume work on the El Hamdania Port project.62  In addition to Algeria and Morocco in North Africa, China has invested heavily in the Middle East country of Oman. China’s investment in the Sino-Oman industrial city and the Duqm Special Economic Zone has reached US$10.7 billion. After its completion, the Duqm Special Economic Zone will be the biggest special economic zone of the MENA region. According to Lu Ruquan, director of the Strategic Development Department of the China National Petroleum Corporation, Oman is China’s main energy corridor. According to news reports, Oman’s Duqm Port could help China bypass the Strait of Hormuz in case of a military conflict between the United States and Iran.63                                                     61 Giancarlo Elia Valori, The African Oil Markets of China and the Continuous Daily Needs for Crude Oil, Mod.

Its institutions reportedly are financing 20% and constructing 75% of all infrastructure projects in the continent. Road and rail transport and shipping and port projects constitute over half of the BRI projects.     Kenya has been a major participant in the BRI, in large part because China considers it an access point to markets in East and Central Africa. Kenya has 43 loans (including those extended before the implementation of the BRI) worth US$9.2 billion, and interest payments to Chinese lenders constituted 87% of money it used to service its debts in 2019.    The standard gauge railway (SGR) project connecting Mombasa port to Nairobi-Naivasha-Kisumu and on to Malaba, at the Kenya-Uganda border, is one of the flagship projects of the BRI in Kenya. In 2014, Kenya and China signed a US$3.8 billion contract to develop the first leg of the SGR project connecting Mombasa to Nairobi (287 miles of SGR tracks). The Exim Bank of China provided the lion’s share of the financing for the project and China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC), a Chinese state-owned firm, was selected to build the line, which it completed in 2017.    The SGR project has benefited Kenya in many ways. It has cut travel time from Mombasa to Nairobi by more than half. The construction of the project created thousands of temporary local jobs. It has also improved trade and connectivity, boosted local enterprises, brought about benefits in regards to technology and skill transfer, and is expected to bolster tourism.    Nonetheless, the project has faced (and continues to face) a myriad of challenges. Chief among them is that the Exim Bank reportedly inserted a confidentiality clause into the loan agreement, which shielded its terms from public scrutiny until it was too late to stop or alter them. Another major challenge was the cost of the project. Kenya had a number of options (including rehabilitating an old line and refurbishing it with the same or different gauge), but it opted for the most expensive option of building a new line. Another challenge, related to the cost of the project, is the use of the Mombasa port, a key national asset, as collateral for the project and the waiving of sovereign immunity, exposing the port to a potential takeover by the Chinese. The fact that Kenya continues to struggle to generate enough revenue from the line to service its debt has exacerbated the problem, so much so that a recent parliamentary committee report called for renegotiation of the terms of the loan with China. Other challenges to the project include corruption; an arbitration clause in the loan agreement making the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC) the final and binding arbiter of any and all disputes between the Exim Bank and Kenya; and ecosystem degradation, fragmentation and destruction.    \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 38  Some of the challenges resulted from the absence of national laws to protect the national interest, and from the deliberate disregard of existing laws by those who negotiated the loan and construction agreements. When Kenya awarded CRBC the contract to build the SGR, it did so without open tendering, in disregard of the 2010 Constitution and the 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. The Act permits the government to bypass its provisions if doing so is part of a negotiated grant or loan agreement, which the government claimed was the case here. In a 2020 decision, in response to a legal challenge brought in 2014, the Court of Appeal held that the engagement of CRBC was not an obligation arising out of a negotiated grant or loan agreement, and thus violated the Constitution and the Public Procurement and Disposal Act. In 2014, Kenya issued local content rules requiring foreign firms to subcontract or enter into joint ventures with local persons for at least 30% of the value of a contract they win. However, this law did not take effect until 2016. Although Kenya made a gentlemen’s agreement that CRBC would use local content for 40% of its needs for the SGR, with the exception of its cement needs, a number of factors made this difficult to achieve.   I.  Introduction  In 2013 China announced its “One Belt, One Road” (OBAR), also known as “Belt and Road” (BRI) initiative, a plan to establish trade networks linking China to markets in Asia, Europe and Africa.1 The initiative encompasses two primary components: “the “Silk Road Economic Belt,” which is a network of land- based infrastructure projects spanning from central China through Central Asia to Europe, and the “Maritime Silk Road” (MSR), which is composed of a series of port and coastal infrastructure projects extending from South and Southeast Asia to East Africa and the Mediterranean.2”   The popularity of the BRI in Africa is hard to overstate. It appears that all African countries, with the exception of Benin, Eritrea, Eswatini, Mali, and Sao Tome and Principe, have either signed a memorandum of understanding or expressed their support.3 By April 2019, China had signed BRI cooperation documents with 39 of the 53 African countries and the African Union.4 Kenya’s location is considered by China to be a key “maritime pivot point” for the initiative.5 According to one source, “Chinese policymakers viewed Kenya as a prime opportunity because of its                                                  1 Tatenda Kunaka, One Belt One Road Initiative: An African Perspective 6 (2018), https://perma.cc/7BWP-RXER.  2 Aweis Osman, China’s Maritime Silk Road and the Future of African Arbitration, in The Belt and Road Initiative: Law, Economics, and Politics 734, 734-735 (Julien Chaisse & Jędrzej Górski eds., 2018). 3 Venkateswaran Lokanathan, China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Implications in Africa 2 (Observer Research Found.

One source notes that “[b]y the end of 2009, China had provided assistance to over 500 infrastructure projects in Africa. Between 2010 and 2012, the Chinese government had approved a total of $11.3 billion in concessional loan financing.”7 However, its footprint was relatively small. For instance, in a span of thirteen years in the pre-BRI era, China reportedly extended US$2.2 billion in credit to Kenya.8 Since 2014, China reportedly lent Kenya around US$7 billion.9   The BRI in Africa heavily favors investment in infrastructure. At present, China is said to be the single largest financier of infrastructure projects in Africa, “financing 20% of all projects and constructing 75% of them.”10 Road and rail transport as well as shipping and ports projects constitute about 53%, followed by energy sector projects (17.6%), real estate development projects (about 14%) and mining sector projects (about 8%).11 According to the Global Development Policy Center data, loans made in transportation (US$46.6 billion), power (US$30 billion), and mining (US$18.4 billion) sectors constitute two-thirds of the US$153 billion that China has committed in Africa.12   Need is the primary diver of this focus on infrastructure. One source notes that “huge infrastructure gaps remain stumbling blocks to growth, investment and economic diversification” in Africa.13 A 2018 Africa Development Bank (AfDB)) report on the continent’s economic outlook noted the importance of investment in infrastructure, noting,   Africa must industrialize to end poverty and generate employment for the 12 million young people who join its labor force every year.   One of the key factors retarding industrialization has been insufficient stock of productive infrastructure in power, water, and transport services that would allow firms to thrive in industries with strong comparative advantages.14                                                   6 Jacob J. Lew & Gary Roughead et al., Council on Foreign Relations, China’s Belt and Road: Implications for the United States 46 (Mar. 2021), https://perma.cc/V43T-ZPGE.  7 Osman, supra note 2, at 735. 8 Lew & Roughhead, supra note 6, at 47.  9 Id.  10 Evaristus M.

Among the flagship programs Agenda 2063 identifies is an integrated high-speed train network “to connect all African capitals and commercial centres . . . thereby facilitating the movement of goods, factors services and people.”16 In 2015, China and the AU signed a memorandum of understanding on China-Africa cooperation on infrastructure.17 According to the MOU, “China will be in the ‘Africa Vision 2063’ strategic framework, to strengthen cooperation with African countries in railway, highway, aviation and industrial areas of the region, and to promote the integration of African countries.”18 Other points of convergence between BRI and Agenda 2063 are in industrialization, financial integration, and development.19  The BRI also aligns with Kenya’s “Vision 2030,” a long-term development blueprint launched in 2008 that aims to transform the country into “a newly-industrialising, middle income country providing a high quality of life to all its citizens in a clean and secure environment.\"20 In 2017, Kenya announced what is known as the “Big Four Agenda,” a plan that complements Vision 2030 and that includes four pillars: food security, affordable housing, universal health care, and manufacturing and job creation.21 Realization of these plans needs “significant resources and the modernization of the country’s infrastructure.”22 The BRI is one possible initiative for realizing these goals.  In May 2014, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a US$3.8 billion contract to lay 287 miles of SGR connecting Mombasa to Nairobi.23 China financed 90% of the project, with Kenya shouldering the rest.24 The Export Import Bank of China (Exim Bank), which operates as a government development bank, provided US$3.2 billion in loans.25 The                                                  15 Id.  16 Flagship Projects of Agenda 2063, African Union, https://perma.cc/9L8N-V5M9.   17 Neil Renwick, Jing Gu & Sen Gong, The Impact of BRI Investment in Infrastructure on Achieving the Sustainable Development Goals 15 (Sept. 2018), https://perma.cc/TK4X-D7Y9.   18 Id.  19 Umar Muhammad Gummi et al., China-Africa Economic Ties: Where Agenda 2063 and Belt and Road Initiative Converged and Diverged?, 11(5) Modern Economy 1026 (May 2020), https://perma.cc/72ZM-TD32.  20 About Vision 2030, Kenya Government Website, https://perma.cc/DA43-BMTB.   21 How the Government Can Achieve the Big Four Agenda on Housing, KIPPRA (Jan. 7, 2021), https://perma.cc/GWV4-3UUS; Sabastien Goulard, Obstacles to the BRI in Kenya, OBOReurope (July 11, 2020), https://perma.cc/2HFP-Z4RG.   22 Goulard, supra note 21.  23 Irandu & Owilla, supra note 10, at 466.  24 Osman, supra note 2, at 737.  25 Id.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 41 Mombasa-Nairobi line was inaugurated in May 2017.26 Kenya added a 75-mile leg to Naivasha, a town in Nakuru County, for an additional US$1.5 billion.27  Kenya is heavily indebted to China. China reportedly committed US$9.2 billion to Kenya in 43 loans from 2001 through 2019.28 While the loans made before 2014 (around USD$1.8 billion) pre-dated the BRI, it is difficult to determine which loans made after 2014 are part of the BRI, given the lack of transparency surrounding the BRI deals..29 However, secondary sources indicate that projects such as the expansion of the Mombasa port (the larders port in East Africa), the deep-sea port and related infrastructure projects at Lamu, and the SGR project are part of the BRI.30 In 2019, interest payments to Chinese lenders constituted 87% of the money used to service Kenya’s debt.31   Nonetheless, according to a 2020 joint World Bank-IMF debt sustainability analysis, Kenya’s debt remains sustainable and is projected to improve as the global economy rebounds from the slump caused by the Covid-19 pandemic.32 This report noted that Kenya’s gross public debt has increased from 50.2% of GDP in 2015 to 61.7% in 2019, largely due to large infrastructure projects, and the country’s risk of debt distress moved from moderate to high, primarily due to the economic slowdown resulting from the pandemic.33 The report also noted that the country’s public debt as a share of GDP is expected to increase to 69.9% by 2022, and then gradually decline.34  A number of factors explain the rapid expansion of the BRI in Africa. Chief among them is the fact that China is often the only game in town. One source notes that “[a]lthough Kenya enjoys access to international capital markets, it has been unable to finance desired infrastructure projects before China stepped in.”35 This issue is probably more acute for countries like Kenya that have a difficult relationship with western donor and lender institutions due to their political standing. Another factor is the Chinese lenders’ flexibility to work with African countries, including in the types of resources they are willing to accept to secure loans. Another source notes that:                                                   26 Duncan Miriri, Kenya Inaugurates Chinese-Built Railway Linking Port to Capital, Reuters (May 31, 2017), https://perma.cc/CPY5-RGTC.   27 Carlos Mureithi, Kenya’s Expensive Chinese-Built Railway is Racking up Losses Even as Loans Come Due, Quartz (Oct 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/SWP6-G8HR.  28 Global Development Policy Centre, supra note 12.  29 Id.  30 Lew and Roughead, supra note 6, at 46.  31 Id. at 49.  32 Int’l Dev.

China Exim Bank is an export credit agency offering loans on a bilateral basis. It evaluates the level of concession taking into account the nature of the projects. The bank’s competitive edge is that it allows countries that do not have enough financial guarantees to use their natural resources as collateral for infrastructure development. This funding model, known as the ‘Angola model’ has come in for serious criticism because using resources as collateral tends to reinforce the ‘resource curse’ of recipient economies.36  African countries choose this route as a way of attracting finance, while lenders see it as a way to minimize their risk.37   Other reasons that contribute to the success of Chinese institutions in Africa reportedly include cost effectiveness, administrative efficiency, and speedy delivery.38   However, after the rapid initial expansion, the BRI appears to be facing some headwinds. China recently declined Kenya’s request for US$3.68 billion in loans and grants for the third phase of the SGR project (Naivasha-Kisumu, and on to Malaba), “a critical segment of the Northern Corridor project that is supposed to link the port of Mombasa with the Great Lakes Region’s landlocked states.”39 Similarly, the Exim Bank recently declined to finance a major solar project in Zimbabwe due to the country’s legacy debts.40   However, it is not just China getting cold feet. In 2019, Tanzania’s President John Magufuli cancelled a US$10 billion Bagamoyo Port project signed by his predecessor in 2013, citing that some of the terms of the agreement made with Merchant’s Holdings, a Chinese company contracted to develop the port and contiguous area, were particularly onerous and made the deal infeasible.41 One source described the points of disagreement as follows:  Despite this strong financial incentive, the Tanzanian government rejected five demands made by China Merchants claiming they were not beneficial to the country. Instead of a 99-year lease [of the port], the government is now willing to issue China Merchants only a 33-year lease. The government also denied the company the tax-free status it requested, making clear that it would be subject to all applicable taxes. Likewise, the government denied the company’s request to receive a special rate for water and electricity, insisting that it would be subject to the market rate like all other investors. The government also denied China Merchants the ability to open and operate other businesses                                                  36 Irandu & Owilla, supra note 10, at 463-464.  37 Njiraini Muchira, Limited Sovereignty as African Countries Mortgage Resources to China, The Maritime Executive (Apr. 4, 2021), https://perma.cc/2PU4-3SK9.   38 Kunaka, supra note 1, at 9.  39 Allan Olingo, Kenya Fails to Secure $3.6n from China for Third Phase of SGR Line to Kisumu, The East African (Apr. 27, 2019), https://perma.cc/V8UL-UHSR.   40 David Herbling & Dandan Li, China’s Built a Railroad to Nowhere in Kenya, Bloomberg (July 2019), https://perma.cc/QS8D-WQCQ.   41 Bagomoyo Port Project Timeline and All You Need to Know, Construction Review Online (Apr. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/33QT-4ECZ.   \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 43 it deemed necessary within the port without government approval. Further, any such business, if approved, would remain subject to government oversight and regulation. Finally, the government stated that it would remain free to develop other ports to compete with Bagamoyo.42  In cancelling the deal, Magufuli is said to have remarked that “only a drunk person [would] accept the terms.”43   This report looks at the implementation of the BRI in Kenya with special focus on the first leg of the SGR project connecting Mombasa port to Nairobi.   II.  Legal & Policy Framework   A.  Bilateral Agreements  As noted above, the BRI kicked off in Kenya in May 2014 with the Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta signing a US $3.8 billion contract to lay 287 miles of SGR connecting Mombasa to Nairobi. The countries have since signed a number of other agreements. Because the texts of such agreements generally have not been made public, this report heavily relies on secondary sources.   B. National Laws   Some key national Kenyan laws appear to be relevant to BRI agreements, particularly with regard to an obligation of the government to issue open bids for public contracts and make information relating to those contracts accessible to the public.   1. Constitution  The procurement of public goods and services clause, set forth in section 227 of the Kenyan Constitution, states that “[w]hen a State organ or any other public entity contracts for goods or services, it shall do so in accordance with a system that is fair, equitable, transparent, competitive and cost-effective.”44 The Constitution mandates that Parliament put in place “a framework within which policies relating to procurement and asset disposal shall be implemented.”45                                                    42 John Hursh, Tanzania Pushes Back on Chines Port Project, The Maritime Executive (Dec. 2, 2019), https://perma.cc/7LBS-LF5N.  43 Tejas Joshi, “Only a Drunk Person would Accept These Terms”, Tanzania President Rejects China’s $10 Bln Loan, HW English (Apr. 25, 2020), https://perma.cc/E3L8-DSP5.  44 Constitution of Kenya, 2010, § 227(1).  45 Id.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 44 The access to information clause provides that “[e]very citizen has the right of access to . . . information held by the state.”46 It further states that the “State shall publish and publicise any information affecting the nation.”47  2. Procurement Law The current law governing government procurement and asset disposal matters is the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act of 2015, which took effect in January 2016.48 Prior to that, including at the time the SGR deal was negotiated and signed, the applicable law was the Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 2005.49 The 2005 Act was at the center of the legal suit challenging the legality of the SGR deal (see part II(C) below).   The stated purpose of the 2005 Act included to “establish procedures for procurement,”  “increase transparency and accountability in those procedures,”  “increase public confidence in those procedures” and “facilitate the promotion of local industry and economic development.”50 It also required that government institutions use “open tendering” established under its provisions for each procurement.51 A clause on conflicts with international agreements stated that “[w]here any provision of this Act conflicts with any obligations of the Republic of Kenya arising from a treaty or other agreement to which Kenya is a party, this Act shall prevail except in instances of negotiated grants or loans.”52 A clause on conflicts with conditions on donated funds stated that “[i]f there is a conflict between this Act, the regulations or any directions of the Authority and a condition imposed by the donor of funds, the condition shall prevail with respect to a procurement that uses those funds and no others.”53 For discussion on the relevance of these provisions, see Part II(C) below.   The current version of the conflicts with international agreements clause states that “[s]ubject to the Constitution, where any provision of this Act conflicts with any obligations of the Republic of Kenya arising from a treaty, agreement or other convention ratified by Kenya and to which Kenya is party, the terms of the treaty or agreement shall prevail.”54  3. Access to Information Act Enacted in 2016, the Access to Information Act mandates that, subject to its provisions or other applicable law, “every citizen has the right of access to information held by . . . the state.”55 Subject                                                  46 Id. § 35 (1).  47 Id § 35 (3).  48 Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act No. 33 of 2015 (Jan. 7, 2016), https://perma.cc/NFG3-8FTV.   49 Public Procurement and Disposal Act No. 3 of 2005 (Oct. 26, 2005), https://perma.cc/2TTP-R6M8.   50 Id.. § 2 51 Id. § 29.  52 Id. § 6(1).  53 Id. § 7(1).  54 Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act, 2015, § 6.  55 Access to Information Act No. 31 of 2016 § 4 (Sept. 21, 2016), https://perma.cc/8GWS-UZ6P.   \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 45 to a number of conditions, including if disclosure would harm national security or impede due process of the law, a public entity must:  upon signing any contract, publish on its website or through other suitable media the following particulars in respect of the contract entered into—  i. the public works, goods acquired or rented, and the contracted service, including any sketches, scopes of service and terms of reference; ii. the contract sum; iii. the name of the service provider, contractor or individual to whom the contract has been granted; and iv. the periods within which the contract shall be completed.56  4. Local Content Law In 2014, Kenya issued local content rules that reserve for Kenyans certain shares of activities in construction projects involving foreign firms and require foreign construction firms to train local workers. Under the regulations, any foreign firm that undertakes construction works in Kenya:    (i) shall subcontract or enter into a joint venture with a local person or local firm for not less than thirty percent of the value of the contract work for which temporary registration is sought;  (ii) shall transfer technical skills not available locally to a local person or firm in such manner as the Authority may determine from time to time.57  The regulations reportedly took effect in August 1, 2016.58 This, together with the fact that the National Construction Authority did not become operational until 2017, meant that the regulations did not apply to the SGR project.59   C. The Court of Appeal Decision   In 2014, the Law Society of Kenya and human rights activists petitioned the High Court of Kenya at Nairobi challenging the constitutionality and legality of the construction of the SGR project.60 The High Court summarized the petitioners’ case as follows:                                                   56 Id. §§ 5 & 6.  57 National Construction Authority Regulations, 2014, § 12(3)(d), Kenya Gazette Supplement, No. 82 (June 6, 2014), https://perma.cc/DF9Y-D6X7.

They are particularly aggrieved that the Government allegedly failed to exercise due diligence as it failed to independently carry out a feasibility study and design of the project before seeking contractors to implement it. They also claim that the Government erred in single-sourcing for the project and allowing the use of locomotives from [China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC),] which is not a manufacturer of the same. They also allege that there is a conflict of interest in the implementation of the project and lastly, that the Government failed to undertake due diligence in contracting [with the CRBC,] which has been blacklisted by the World Bank and been declared ineligible to engage in any road and bridge construction funded by the World Bank.61  The petitioners sought a determination by the Court on a number of issues. These included whether the respondents “willfully or carelessly” failed to comply with the procurement of public goods and services clause in section 227 of the Constitution and the provisions of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, and whether the characterization of the arrangement as a government-to-government contract rendered Kenyan constitutional and public procurement laws inapplicable.62 Among others, the petitioners asked the Court to declare the SGR project contract invalid and that the railway must be procured through a competitive bidding process.63   The High Court rejected the petition on procedural grounds, finding that the proof that the petitioners presented to support their case was inadmissible because it included internal documents that were not authorized for release and thus were obtained unlawfully.64 The court ordered that such documents be expunged from the record.65  The petitioners appealed to the Court of Appeal, which issued a decision in June 2020, three years after the completion of the Mombasa-Nairobi segment of the project. The court considered whether the matter was moot, given the SGR project was substantially complete.66 The court held that although the case had started before the implementation of the contract, given that by the time it reached the court the contract had been executed, it was impossible to “restrain the implementation of the impugned contract.”67 Other claims of relief, however, were not deemed moot.68                                                    61 Id. ¶ 2.  62 Id. ¶ 3. 63 Id. ¶ 4. 64 Id. ¶ 126.  65 Id.  66 Okiya Omtatah Okoiti & 2 others v Attorney General & 4 others [2020] para 61 eKLR, https://perma.cc/2L6A-TKTP.    67 Id. ¶ 68.  68 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 47 The court considered the issue of admissibility of illegally obtained evidence. On this issue, the court agreed with the holding of the High Court, stating that “[w]e do not have any basis for interfering with the decision of the High Court to expunge the documents in question.”69   The Court of Appeal then turned to “whether the procurement violated Article 227 of the Constitution and statutory law and whether the procurement in this instance was exempt from the provisions of the Act by reason of Section 6(1)” of the 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act,70 and on this issue, the Court sided with the appellants. It rejected the government’s claim that it engaged CRBC as the contractor as a result of a requirement under a financing agreement, ruling that “the engagement of CRBC was not an obligation arising from ‘negotiated grant or loan’ agreement for purposes of Section 6 of the Act. This is because as indicated above, the contract with CRBC as the contractor was procured long before the financing agreement was entered into.”71 The Court further held that:   108. We do not think that in enacting Section 6 of the Act, it was intended that the identification of a supplier of goods and services (in effect the procurement) would precede the loan agreement which would oust the procurement procedures under the Act. In this case, it is the procurement that dictated the terms of the loan that ousted the procurement procedures under the Act as opposed to the terms of the loan agreement dictating the procurement procedure or who the supplier of the goods and services would be. The situation is not at all ameliorated by the fact that the entity that undertook the feasibility study and spelt out the manner in which the project would be implemented dictated that it would be the implementor or executor of the project. 109. We conclude and hold, therefore, that in this instance, Section 6(1) of the Act did not oust the application of the Act from the procurement and [Kenya Railways Corporation], as the procuring entity, was therefore under an obligation to comply with the requirements of the Act in the procurement of the SGR project.72  The Court thus set aside the High Court’s decision relating to whether the procurement of the SGR was exempt from the provisions of the 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. It substituted it with an order that the “Kenya Railways Corporation, as the procuring entity, failed to comply with, and violated provisions of Article 227 (1) of the Constitution and Sections 6 (1) and 29 [choice of procurement procedure], of the Public Procurement and Disposal Act, 2005 in the procurement of the SGR project.”73  III.  Mombasa–Nairobi SGR Project  Kenya’s SGR program was split into three phases: Mombasa-Nairobi, Nairobi-Naivasha, , and Nairobi-Kismu-Malaba.74                                                  69 Id ¶ 84.  70 Id. ¶ 85.  71 Id. ¶ 107.  72 Id.  73 Id. ¶ 111. 74 Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway Project, Railway Technology, https://perma.cc/W7EG-A3VC.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 48  Phase one of the SGR, the Mombasa-Nairobi SGR development, is BRI’s flagship project in Kenya.75 In 2009, Kenya’s Ministry of Transport signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with the CRBC, a state-owned corporation, tasking CRBC to study the feasibility of a construction of a 310 mile electric railway system.76 The MOU also provided that if CRBC found the project feasible, it “would help identify the source of its financing.”77 In 2012, the Kenyan government decided that it would seek financing from China and that “the project would be undertaken under government to government terms.”78  As noted above, in May 2014, Chinese Premier Li Keqiang and Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta signed a US $3.8 billion contract to lay the 287-mile SGR connecting Mombasa to Nairobi.79 China financed 90% of the project and Kenya covered the rest.80 China’s share of the financing (US$3.2 billion) for the project came from the Exim Bank.81 The Mombasa-Nairobi line was inaugurated in May 2017.82 Kenya added another 75-mile leg to Naivasha, a town in Nakuru County, for additional US$1.5 billion.83  A.  Controversy Surrounding Debt Terms and Conditions of Project   Although its long-term benefits are hard to quantify at present, the SGR project brought about a number of immediate positive developments for Kenya. Aside from the jobs produced during the construction phase of the SGR, the project created 2,285 jobs at the 33 stations and in the passenger and cargo rolling stock.84 It dramatically reduced the travel time between Mombasa and Nairobi from over 10 hours to less than five hours.85 Once the SGR is expanded and connected to similar rail lines in the region, it will likely improve the movement of goods and fuel regional integration.  Apart from these immediate and potential future benefits, the SGR project has also had various challenges. Some of these are highlighted below.                                                     75 Elaine K.

Transparency   One of the major challenges to ensuring accountability around BRI projects is that they are often shrouded  in secrecy.86  In fact, China typically keeps the terms of the BRI deals out of the public eye by requiring a confidentiality clause in such agreements. For instance, according to a  2019 article in the Daily Nation, a Kenyan newspaper, a clause in the SGR loan agreement (clause 17.7) states that “[t]he borrower (Kenya) shall keep all the terms and conditions hereunder or in connection with this agreement strictly confidential.”87 The same clause makes disclosure of the terms of the contract dependent on the consent of the lender, stating that \"[w]ithout the prior written consent of the lender (China), the borrower shall not disclose any information hereunder or in connection with this agreement to any third party unless required by applicable law.”88 The Access to Information Act, enacted in 2016, did not exist in 2014 when China and Kenya entered into the SGR agreement.   2.  Cost of Project  Some sources note that, in developing the SGR, Kenya chose the most expensive option among those available to it. A World Bank study looked at four possible alternatives to upgrading the railway network in the East African Community89:  (1) rehabilitate the existing network to the original standard and gauge, (2) refurbish /upgrade the network to a higher standard, with the same gauge; (3) refurbish/upgrade the network to a higher standard, with a different gauge such as Standard Gauge on the same alignment, or (4) construct a new right of way.90   The study provided the axle load, speed, cost breakdowns and justifications for or against each alternative based on an assumption that freight traffic in the EAC community rail network will reach about 14.4 million tons by 2030:                                                    86 David Dollar, Brookings Inst., Understanding China’s Belt and Road Infrastructure Projects in Africa 2 (Sept. 2019), https://perma.cc/67WE-EBNK.  87 SGR Pact with China a Risk to Kenyan Sovereignty, Assets, Daily Nation (Jan. 13, 2019), https://perma.cc/D2QQ-G2CQ.  88 Id.  89 The Community’s member states are Burundi, Kenya, Rwanda, South Sudan, Tanzania, and Uganda. 90 The World Bank – Africa Transport Unit, The Economics of Rail Gauge in the East Africa Community 2-3 (Aug. 8, 2013), https://perma.cc/2EXU-3K7G.   \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 50  Project type Axle load to be realized Maximum Operating Speed Maximum annual capacity Project Cost  Justification for/against Project Alt. # 1 15-18 tons/axles 49.7 miles/h 5.5 million tons US$289,682/mile Would struggle to meet demand by 2030 Alt. # 2 25 tons/axles 74.5 miles/h 60 million tons US$788,578/mile Justified if 6.2 million tons of freight is added to the network annually  Alt. # 3 25 tons/axles 80.7 miles/h 60 million tons US$2.4 million/mile Justified if 20.2 million tons of freight is added to the network annually Alt. # 4 25 tons/axles 74.5 miles/h 60 million tons US$5.2 million/mile Justified if 55.2 million tons of freight is added to the network annually Created by author from information provided in The Economics of Rail Gauge in the East Africa Community, The World Bank – Africa Transport Unit (Aug. 8, 2013).   Having opted for the most expensive alternative, Kenya is said to have paid about US$9million per mile just for tracks and around US$11 million per mile including all other expenditures.91 Although initial feasibility studies were done for an electrified system, the Mombasa-Nairobi line currently run by diesel powered locomotives.92 In 2018, Kenya reportedly signed a contract with China Electric Power Equipment and Technology Company (CET) for the electrification of the Mombasa-Nairobi line, at an additional cost of US$239 million.93 A similar project in Tanzania (with one major exception in that the Tanzania system is electrified) built by a Turkish company that had won the contract in an open and competitive bid was said to have been built at a significantly lower cost.94  3. Corruption  Corruption remains a huge problem in Kenya. The 2020 Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index report ranked Kenya 124 out of 180 countries, with a 31/100 score.95 Thus, it comes as no surprise that the SGR project would have corruption issues. Among the most high profile cases involved the arrest of the head of the country’s National Lands Commission (NLC) and the managing director of the Kenya Railways Corporation, as well as a number of other                                                  91 Nancy Kacungira, Will Kenya Get Value for Money from Its New Railway?, BBC News (Jun. 8, 2017), https://perma.cc/5JM9-HEKB.   92 Kenya to Rethink Railway Due to Erratic Power Supply, ESI Africa (Jan 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/WMS9-MZD5.   93 Keith Barrow, Kenya SGR Electrification Contract Signed, International Railway J.

Take-or-Pay Clause and Debt Sustainability  Under the terms of the loan agreement, the Kenya Port Authority, the guarantor of the loan with the Mombasa port as collateral, had to enter into a long-term service purchase agreement and a ”take or pay” deal with the Kenya Railways Corporation (KRC) to ensure that the SGR gets a guaranteed cargo to generate sufficient revenue to service the debt.99 According to the F.T.Kimani, Kenya’s Auditor General, “”[t]he payment arrangement agreement substantively means that the [Kenya Port] Authority's revenue would be used to pay the Government of Kenya's debt to China Exim bank if the minimum volumes required for [rail] consignment are not met.”100  The cargo transported though the SGR was not nearly enough to meet the amount required under the terms of the loan agreement. The Mombasa-Nairobi SGR was built to accommodate 22 million tons annually.101 However, as the cargo throughput at Mombasa port increased, the throughput at the SGR did not. For instance, in 2019, the annual cargo throughput at the Mombasa port amounted to 34.4 million tons, an 11% increase from the previous year.102 Due to the Covid-19 global pandemic, the port’s throughput in 2020 was 34 million tons, lower than the 35.9 million tons projected,103 but way above the 22 million-ton limit of the SGR. Nonetheless, the SGR transported only 5.09 million tons in 2018, and only 3.25 million tons in the first nine months of                                                  96 Humphrey Malalo, Kenya Arrests Two Top Officials for Suspected Corruption over the New $3 Billion Railway, Reuters (Aug. 11, 2018), https://perma.cc/2NWU-DS8M.  97 Salem Solomon, Chinese Officials Arrested for Bribery Amid Kenya’s SGR Corruption Inquiry, VOA (Nov. 26, 2018), https://perma.cc/ER3N-RQVL.  98 Moses Michira, Anti-Graft Unit Freezes Payout for SGR Land, The Standard (Feb. 15, 2019), https://perma.cc/FR7Q-KHWP.  99 Daily Nation, supra note 87; Duncan Miriri, Kenya Forcing Importers to Use Costly New Chines Railway, Businessmen Say, Reuters (Dec. 3, 2019), https://perma.cc/9CJ3-FTHF.   100 Report: Kenya Risks Losing Port of Mombasa to China, The Maritime Executive (Dec. 20, 2018), https://perma.cc/57XW-DC2H.   101 Railway Technology, supra note 74.   102 Njiraini Muchira, Increase in Cargo at Mombasa Port Prompts Use of Double Stack Trains, The Maritime Executive (Feb. 5, 2021), https://perma.cc/9385-M8YS.   103 Gilbert Langat, Shippers Council of Eastern Africa, Covid-19 and Maritime Transport: Disruption and Resilience in Africa 10 (Apr. 26, 2021), https://perma.cc/B8UM-N8UQ.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 52 2019.104 In 2020, the SGR reportedly carried 4.4 million tons of cargo.105 This was reportedly due in part to the fact that trucking remained a cheaper option.106  Also part of the challenge is the fact that Kenya does not operate the SGR. CRBC operates the SGR through its subsidiary, Africa Star Railway Operation Co. (AfriStar). (See Part III.B below.) The Kenyan government pays US$1 million per month to Afristar to operate the line and is said to have racked up US$380 million in unpaid bills to the company.107 Afristar’s operational costs have consistently come in higher than the revenue it generates. A government report noted that the line registered a loss of over US$200 million over three years, a loss that, due to the manner in which the financing is structured, taxpayers have to cover.108 This has made it difficult for Kenya to cover the operational cost and service its debt.109  Kenya sought to boost the amount of cargo transported through the SGR by requiring businesses to use the line. On March 15, 2019, the Kenya Port Authority (KPA) issued a directive “notifying the general public that from the date of the directive, shipping lines would not be allowed to endorse a Bill of lading to importers’ Container Freight Station (CFS) of choice.”110 On August 3, 2019, the KPA and the Kenya Revenue Authority issued another directive “stating that all imported cargo for delivery to Nairobi and the hinterland shall be conveyed by the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and cleared at the Inland Container Depot – Nairobi.”111 This led to a lawsuit challenging the legality and constitutionality of the directives before the Constitutional and Human Rights Division of the Kenya High Court at Mombasa and, on November 6, 2020, the Court found both directives unconstitutional and therefore void.112  A recent Parliamentary report on the use of the SGR also found that forcing businesses to use the rail line is in violation of Kenya’s international obligations, stating:  Forced railage is against the International Maritime Laws and World Trade Organization Treaties that allow cargo owners to choose the mode of transportation that is competitive in their view. The forced railage has not only increased cost of doing business because of                                                  104 Ian Taylor, Kenya’s New Lunatic Express: The Standard Gauge Railway, 34 (3-4) Afr.

(See Part III.B below.)  5.  Sovereign Immunity Waiver  Kenya is said to have waived its sovereign immunity in the loan agreement, potentially exposing key public assets to seizure by China in the event of a default. According to a 2018 report by Kenya’s auditor general, the “[Kenya Port Authority] assets are exposed since the Authority signed the agreement where it has been referred to as a borrower under clause 17.5 and any proceeding against its assets by the lender would not be protected by sovereign immunity since the government waived the immunity on the Kenya port assets by signing the agreement.”117 The loan agreement is said to include a clause stating that “[n]either the borrower (Kenya) nor any of its assets is entitled to any right of immunity on the grounds of sovereignty or otherwise from arbitration, suit, execution or any other legal process with respect to its obligations under this Agreement, as the case may be in any jurisdiction.”118   One source noted that although it is unlikely that China will seize the Mombasa port in the event that Kenya fails to meet its debt obligations, “the possibility gives Beijing leverage over Kenyan political decisions.”119                                                    113 National Assembly, 12th Parliament (Fourth Session), Departmental Committee on Transport, Public Works and Housing, Report on the Inquiry into the Use of the Standard Gauge Railway 39 (Sept. 2020), https://perma.cc/GZ2H-PK26.  114 Taylor, supra note 104, at 19; Daily Nation, supra note 87.  115 National Assembly, 12th Parliament (Fourth Session), Departmental Committee on Transport, supra note 113, at x, 22 & 42.  116 Id. at 42. 117 The Maritime Executive, supra note 100 (quoting auditor general report); see also Moses Odhiambo, China Could Seize Mombasa Port Over Sh364bn SGR Loan, Star (Mar. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/8L8E-FLY3.   118 Daily Nation, supra note 87.  119 Lew and Roughhead supra note 6, at 47. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 54 Both the Chinese and the Kenyan governments denied that Kenya used the Mombasa port as collateral for the SGR loan.120  6.  Arbitration Clause  Adding a snag to the issues of debt default and the potential exposure of a strategic asset to possible seizure by the lender is an arbitration clause in the loan agreement. Specifically, the clause requires that any dispute between the lender and the borrower be subject to mandatory arbitration before the China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission (CIETAC), whose decision on any dispute is final and binding.121 According to the 2018 auditor general report, “[t]he agreement is biased since any non-performance or dispute with the China Exim bank (the lender) would be referred to arbitration in China, whose fairness in resolving the disagreement may not be guaranteed.”122  B.  Level of Involvement of Local Companies/workforce   Kenya awarded CRBC the two biggest parts of the SGR project: the project’s construction, and the purchase and installation of facilities, locomotives and rolling rock for the project.123 Reports also indicate that the Exim Bank conditioned its loan on Kenya awarding the contract for the operation of the SGR to CRBC, which obtained a noncompetitive 10-year contract to operate the SGR through its subsidiary, Afristar.124 Kenya recently announced that it will exercise an option under the contract that allows it to review and take over the operation of the SGR after 5 years.125 The Kenya Railway Corporation reportedly has begun the takeover and has assumed certain aspects of the operation, including ticketing, security, and fueling functions.126  CRBC claims that it created a large number of local jobs. According to a report it issued in 2018, “the project department hired a total of 72,000 local employees, 26,000 of which were hired for the Phase I Project of Nairobi-Malaba SGR, which played a major role in stimulating local                                                  120 Timothy Maina, Chinese Govt Speaks on Seizing Mombasa Port over Debt, Kenyans.com (Dec. 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/4DN9-M6BA; Patrick Vidija, Yatani: Mombasa Port Not at Risk of Takeover by Chinese Government, Star (Mar. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/5PTM-959Y.   121 Daily Nation, supra note 87. 122 The Maritime Executive, supra note 100. 123 Okiya Omtatah Okoiti & 2 others v Attorney General & 3 others, supra note 60, at ¶ 11.  124 Why Chinese Bank Imposed SGR Line Operator on Kenya, Business Daily (May 17, 2016), https://perma.cc/78LF-RRW9; Kenya Railways Poised to Take Over SGR Operations from Chinese Firm, Construction Review Online (Mar. 9, 2021), https://perma.cc/P3TH-YVZH.   125 Kenya to Take Over Chinese Operated Rail Line Five Years Early, Global Construction Review (Mar. 15, 2021), https://perma.cc/ZE2S-TADB.   126 Kenya Railway Starts SGR Takeover from Chines Firm, Business Daily (Mar. 5, 2021), https://perma.cc/GRQ7-XZC6.   \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 55 employment.”127 Another source noted that the SGR project created at least 60 jobs per .62 miles of railway built.128   However, CRBC has been accused of failing to transfer skills to the local work force. A 2018 report found that Kenyans with better training than their Chinese counterparts were not afforded the opportunity to operate the trains that run in the SGR, and Chinese employees did all the work.129 The source further noted that Kenyan employees complained about how they were intentionally kept in the dark, for instance by requiring Chinese language skills for  troubleshooting, in order to keep Chinese employees indispensable to the operation for as long as possible.130  According to one source, although not included in the written loan agreement, the parties reportedly made a gentlemen’s agreement that CRBC would use local content for 40% of its needs.131 This included local suppliers (including cement, railway sleepers, pebbles, and sand) as well as local service providers (including slope protection, drainage work, transportation, telecommunication, and banking services).132 However, a combination of factors made this difficult to achieve. According to the same source:  In some instances, Kenyan suppliers have been able to extract increasing shares of the supply chain contracts. Organized pressure by Kenyan cement manufacturers directed to the President successfully resulted in the reversal of a previous agreement with Chinese stakeholders to import cement from China. All the cement used for the project was subsequently purchased from Kenyan cement industries. Some of the construction services (slope protection, drainage works, supplies, vehicle hire), as well as the telecom, banking, and other services to the contractors and their camps, were also sourced locally. However, CRBC has had to cope with frequent lack of capacity among local providers. The managing director of Kenya Rail reported in a meeting with representatives of Kenya’s private sector association that many local companies were unable to honor contracts to term and that many laborers “run away after a week or two,” forcing the CRBC to sign short-term trial contracts. Yet, Kenyan cement producers are still among the few local manufacturers supplying materials to the SGR. Steel parts like the rails, railway engines, construction machines, and many other products that cannot currently be produced in Kenya are shipped in from China.133  The source further noted that there is hope the project will spur local employment growth beyond the construction phase:                                                   127 Kenya SGR Project Social Responsibility Report Issued, Golden Bee (Aug. 21, 2018), https://perma.cc/6YHK-YRQB.  128 Dani Redd, The Challenges and Opportunities of Africa’s Standard Gauge Railway, Africa Outlook (undated), https://perma.cc/2J32-36FW.  129 Paul Wafula, Exclusive: Behind the SGR Walls, The Standard (Jul. 8, 2018), https://perma.cc/KEY9-4N3G.  130 Id.  131 Uwe Wissenbach & Yuan Wang, China-Africa Research Initiative, African Politics Meets Chinese Engineers: The Chinese-Built Standard Gauge Railway Project in Kenya and East Africa 15 (Working Paper No. 13, June 2017), https://perma.cc/BW57-P4AT.  132 Id. at 16.  133 Id. at 16.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 56  [B]eyond the construction phase, further benefits are expected to come to local producers who can produce or supply brake blocks, lubricants, fuels, or those who can take advantage of advertising space on trains, ticket sales, catering, cleaning, waste disposal, warehousing, and local distribution of goods shipped in through the trains at the various stations.134  As noted above, the local content rules that Kenya issued in 2014 took effect in 2016, and were inapplicable to the SGR project.   The 2016 Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act includes a provision mandating foreign firms to use local sources for materials. It states:   For the purpose of ensuring sustainable promotion of local industry, a procuring entity shall have in its tender documents a mandatory requirement as preliminary evaluation criteria for all foreign tenderers participating in international tenders to source at least forty percent of their supplies from citizen contractors prior to submitting a tender.135   However, this Act too, was inapplicable to the SGR project, and as discussed above in part III.C, the SGR loan agreement was found by the Court of Appeal to have contravened its predecessor statute, the 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act.   C.  Strategic Purpose of Project   Much has been written about China’s motivations and benefits. Some describe the BRI projects in Africa as a cynical exercise in “debt trap diplomacy.”136 According to this narrative, “China provides infrastructure funding to developing economies under opaque loan terms, only to strategically leverage the recipient country’s indebtedness to China for economic, military, or political favor.”137 Another source describes what the country seeks to reap from the program as follows:  A successful BRI would allow China to more efficiently utilize excess savings and construction capacity, expand trade, consolidate economic and diplomatic relations with participating countries, and diversify China’s import of energy and other resources through economic corridors that circumvent routes that are controlled by the U.S. and its allies.138                                                   134 Id.  135 Public Procurement and Assets Disposal Act § 157(9).  136 Abdi Latif Dahir and Yomi Kazeem, China is Pushing Africa Into Debt, Says America’s Top Diplomat, Quartz Africa, March 7, 2018, https://perma.cc/D3C5-TE4E; Brad Glosserman, ‘Debt Trap' Diplomacy is a Card China Seldom Plays in Belt and Road Initiative, Japan Times (Sept. 1, 2020), https://perma.cc/XZ8V-D2ZJ.   137 Pearl Risberg, The Give and Take of BRI in Africa, Center for Strategic & International Studies (April 2019), https://perma.cc/MPG8-L8RH.   138 Dollar, supra note 86, at 1.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 57 A different source similarly notes that Chinese engagement with Kenya in the SGR project is driven by two key motivations. First is Kenya’s strategic location, which serves as a gateway to Eastern and Central parts of Africa; the SGR “will open up a fast-growing and progressively-integrating region to Chinese and international trade and investment.”139 Second is the fact that the SGR “railway construction and operation contracts are major international business opportunities for (state-owned) Chinese companies affected by oversupply in the Chinese domestic market.”140  While China foresees significant benefits from the BRI, African countries involved in the program, including Kenya, are also likely to gain from it as well. For instance, although other countries have negotiated their own agreements with China, Kenya’s SGR project is said to be the initial phase of what would be a regional railway network connecting Uganda, Rwanda and South Sudan.141 The potential benefits of the BRI to African nations, including in helping them attract international investment and achieve regional integration and inter-regional trade, is immeasurable. According to one source, “[t]here is need to develop transport infrastructure to open up Africa for international and inter regional trade. The continent’s transport infrastructure is poorly developed especially rail transport where colonial powers deliberately built railways of different gauges in their respective spheres of influence.“142 One study described the benefits of the BRI to East African region as follows:  the BRI initiative could have a very significant positive impact on East Africa. For instance, reducing the export and imports trade margins by 10 percent as a result of the BRI could result in increases the GDP growth in East Africa ranging from 0.4 to 1.2 percentage points. It could also contribute to an increase in regional welfare of nearly $ 1 billion. The total exports of countries could also increase by $192 million by boosting intra-regional trade - another important objective against the backdrop of the recently signed African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA).143  As noted above, the SGR has brought about a number of immediate benefits to Kenya, such as improving travel time between Mombasa and Nairobi and creating jobs, both during its construction and in the aftermath. The long-term benefits are hard to quantify at this stage.  However, Kenya appears to be struggling to fund the expansion of the SGR. The economic success of the SGR in large part depends on its further expansion to connect the currently underutilized railway to similar lines in neighboring countries. The project was initially planned to connect “Mombasa to Malaba on the border with Uganda and continue onward to Kampala, Uganda’s capital city. It [was planned to] further run to Kigali in Rwanda with a branch line to Juba in South Sudan. Branch lines along the route [were planned to] extend to Kisumu, Kasese and                                                  139 Wissenbach & Wang, supra note 131, at 5.  140 Id.  141 Dezenski, supra note 75, at 13. 142 Irandu & Owilla, supra note 10, at 459. 143 Rodgers Mukwaya & Andrew Mold, Modelling the Economic Impact of the China Belt and Road Initiative on East Africa (Global Trade Analysis Project Resource Paper #5653) (May 8, 2018), https://perma.cc/2JYJ-JRDN.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 58 Pakwach.”144 As noted above, Kenya’s recent attempt to secure US$3.6 billion from China for the third phase of the SGR project failed.145 It appears that Kenya has now shifted its focus to upgrading the old meter gauge railway from Naivasha to Malaba, with an initial budget of around US$32.5 million.146  IV. Assessment of Project’s Impact    A study on the ecological impact of the SGR conducted along the phase 1 and Phase 2 of the SGR project found it had resulted in ecosystem degradation, fragmentation and destruction. The Study acknowledged the safety and wildlife protection measures taken by the project, stating:  The SGR is categorized as a National Class I railway and has a wide range of safety protection measures in the design and operation that include speed limits, installation of high guard fence, safety buffers and earth embankments to avoid crossing other infrastructures. Furthermore, bridges, underpasses, culverts and flyovers have been constructed in wildlife areas such as Tsavo and Nairobi National Parks and in high human density areas such as Athi River to facilitate free movement of wildlife and people. Within Nairobi National Park, an acoustic noise barrier has been installed to reduce noise disturbance to wildlife.147  The study found, despite these measures, that “[t]he construction of the SGR has led to major impacts on ecosystem, particularly degradation[,] fragmentation and to a less[er] extent ecosystem destruction. Landscape modification by the SGR construction has resulted in increased soil erosion, land degradation, flooding, sedimentation of water bodies, habitat destruction and impeding wildlife movements.”148  A study by the University of Nairobi on the socio-economic impact of the SGR on the port city of Mombasa found mixed results.

Cambodia is one of China’s main Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partners. Cambodia’s foreign debt has increased, and 44% of it was owed to China in 2020. Many of the BRI projects in Cambodia are financed by private companies rather than government-to-government loans. This may reduce the debt-trap risk. Reportedly, much forestland has been destroyed, and some residents have been forced from their homes without just compensation, in the development of BRI projects.    I.  Introduction/Background  Cambodia is one of China’s main Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) partners in Southeast Asia.1 During Chinese President Xi Jinping’s visit to Cambodia in October 2016, the two countries signed 31 cooperation documents, including the Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on the Preparation of a Cooperation Plan for Jointly Promoting the Belt and Road Initiative.2   A.  Cambodia-China Bilateral Relation   Cambodia and China have always had a very strong diplomatic bilateral relation, which can be traced back for 2,000 years.3 President Xi stressed that the two countries are “good neighbors, friends, partners, and brothers” during his visit to Cambodia in 2013,4 and that they are “good neighbors, real friends who are loyal to each other” during another visit in 2016.5 In 2020, Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen said that the two countries have forged “an unbreakable                                                  ∗ With the assistance of Pichrotanak Bunthan, intern.  1 Le Hong Hiep, The BRI’s Footprint in the Lower Mekong Region, Rosa Luxemburf Stiftung (Dec. 15, 2020), https://perma.cc/W29T-YWW2.  2 “一带一路”倡议助力柬埔寨国家发展规划——访柬埔寨首相洪森 [The “Belt and Road” Initiative Helps Cambodia’s National Development Plan-Interview with Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen], Embassy of The People’s Republic of China in the Kingdom of Cambodia (May 18, 2017), https://perma.cc/X47V-NEZE.  3 Chansok Lak, The Belt and Road Initiative and Cambodia’s Infrastructure Connectivity Development: A Cambodian Perspective, in Regional Connection Under the Belt and Road Initiative 134, 135 (Fanny M.

In addition, Cambodia has bought 4 million doses of the vaccines from China.8   Amid the European Union’s threat to place trade sanctions on Cambodia, in 2019, China pledged nearly US$600 million in aid from 2019 to 2021 to the country and promised to import 400,000 tons of Cambodian rice.9 China has been the largest foreign investor in Cambodia. The Council for the Development of Cambodia states, “[o]f the cumulative FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) approved in the period of 1994-2019, the largest share was from China (21.81 percent).”10 In 2019, the Cambodian government recorded approved investments totaling US$9.40 billion, including US$2.75 billion by China, followed by US$912.55 million from Hong Kong and US$298.84 million by Japan.11   By the end of 2020, Cambodia’s foreign debt was US$8.8 billion, 44% (US$3.6 billion) of which was owed to China. China has provided more than US$3 billion in concessional (soft) loans to Cambodia to build about 3,000 kilometers of roads and eight bridges.12  B.  Cambodia’s Embrace of BRI and Its Rationales   Cambodia has embraced the BRI since its inception in 2013 to ensure that Cambodia is at the center of the BRI plan in Southeast Asia.13 Cambodia appears to have three rationales for supporting the BRI.  1.  Economic Rationale   Reaping economic benefits from the BRI projects is probably the most obvious rationale for Cambodia, like most countries engaged in the BRI, to embrace China’s initiative. By linking Asia to Africa and Europe, the BRI is connecting Cambodia to other BRI countries, amounting to about 4.4 billion people or 70% of the world population—a massive market for Cambodia.14                                                   6 General Secretary and President Xi Jinping Exchanges Messages with President of the Cambodian People’s Party and Prime Minister Hun Sen, FMPRC (July 3, 2020), https://perma.cc/N8U9-JX6S. 7 Chinese Top Tourist Arrivals in 2019, Khmer Times (Feb. 7, 2020), https://perma.cc/N53K-LQ2A. 8 Prak Thul, How China’s Vaccine Diplomacy Brought Bosom Buddy Cambodia Even Closer, Reuters (June 8, 2021), https://perma.cc/72HP-LYV5.  9 Joshua Lipes, China Pledges Nearly US $600 Million in Aid to Cambodia Over Three Years: PM Hun Sen, Radio Free Asia (Jan. 22, 2021), https://perma.cc/YQ4R-VKSV.  10 FDI Trend, Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC), https://perma.cc/N69C-NTNC.  11 Id. 12 Chhengpor Aun, Chinese Embassy Denies Debt Trap for Cambodia, VOA Cambodia (Apr. 12, 2021), https://perma.cc/R7JX-FLVT.  13 Sok Kha, The Belt and Road in Cambodia: Successes and Challenges, Diplomat (Apr. 30, 2019), https://perma.cc/B3QE-REB3. 14 Lak, supra note 3, at 148. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Cambodia The Law Library of Congress 62  In addition, BRI projects make financial resources other than from the World Bank Group and the Asian Development Bank available to Cambodia. These financial resources include the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, the Silk Road Fund, and the New Development Bank. These resources are vital to developments in Cambodia, particularly its infrastructure. For example, Cambodia needs US$26 billion to build expressways by 2040.15  Lastly, the BRI fits well with other existing frameworks and strategies that Cambodia is following. “The BRI is properly complementary to the existing connectivity cooperation frameworks and strategies, such as the Master Plan of ASEAN Connectivity 2025 (MPAC – 2025), Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Work Plan III, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Greater Mekong Subregion Infrastructure Connectivity 2015–2020 and its corridors.”16 Additionally, the BRI is consistent with Cambodia’s development plans, such as Cambodia’s National Strategic Development Plan (2014–2018) and Industrial Development Policy (2015–2025). These policies and plans note the significance of the infrastructure and connectivity development in Cambodia.17   2.  Political Security Rationale  Supporting the BRI is possibly one of many of Cambodia’s policies to align itself politically with China in the hope of mutual political support. For example, Cambodia has been adhering to the One-China policy for decades.18 Additionally, Cambodia was accused of blocking ASEAN’s statement regarding the Permanent Court of Arbitration’s ruling against China in the South China Sea dispute, in which many ASEAN countries have rival claims.19 China’s political support has become increasingly crucial to Cambodia over the past years because Cambodia’s relationships with the United States and Europe became strained after Cambodia’s 2018 election.20                                                     15 Id. 16 Id. 17 Id. 18 Id. at 151. 19 Manuel Mogato et al., ASEAN Deadlocked on South China Sea, Cambodia Blocks Statement, Reuters (July 25, 2016), https://perma.cc/4S27-CKGA. 20 Sok Kha, supra note 13; Charles Edel, Cambodia’s Troubling Tilt Toward China, Foreign Aff. (Aug. 17, 2018), https://perma.cc/J5XW-PTFH (by subscription). \fBelt and Road Initiative: Cambodia The Law Library of Congress 63 3.  Socio-Cultural Rationale  As BRI projects overall promote connectivity, the BRI may allow “Cambodia to link its historical, natural, and cultural heritage sites to the other [BRI] countries in order to promote Cambodia’s culture and tourist industrial development.”21  C.  China’s Strategic Geopolitical and Economic Goals in Cambodia   Concerning China’s foreign policy strategy towards Cambodia, it appears “geostrategic interest outweighs economic interest.”22 Cambodia is pivotal for China to project its power and influence in Southeast Asia.23  II.  Legal and Policy Framework   Due to the confidential/secret nature of these projects, any copy of the agreements on the projects are not located. In general, Chinese aids are provided to Cambodia’s government “without bidding transparency, financial auditing, and proper evaluation and public supervision of project operations and outcomes.”24  III.  Major “Flagship” Projects    While some researchers express concern that Cambodia will fall into a debt trap to China, other believe that its debts to China are manageable. In 2019, a Cambodian think tank director asserted “that Cambodia is still in the safe zone with regards to external debt management and that BRI provides more opportunities than risks to Cambodian economy and society.”25 Another BRI observer has stated “Cambodia’s decision to develop BRI projects through private companies rather than government-to-government loans may . . . reduce the debt-trap risk. At the same time, adopting large Chinese infrastructure investments may eventually constrain Cambodia’s strategic autonomy and lead to its economic dependence on China.”26                                                     21 Lak, supra note 3, at 152. 22 Vannarith Chheang, The Political Economy of Chinese Investment in Cambodia, in 16 Trends in Southeast Asia 1, 20 (2017), https://perma.cc/T7S7-XNF7.

Dara Sakor Project  1.  Project Overview  In 2008, long before the BRI was launched in 2013, Cambodia granted the Union Development Group (UDG) a 99-year lease for over 36,000 hectars (about 139 square miles) of land (about 20% of Cambodia’s coastline) in the Koh Kong province of Cambodia, including the Dara Sakor area. After the lease was granted, UDG began to develop the US$3.8 billion Dara Sakor Project, which was later rebranded as a BRI project.27 The project so far includes a luxury resort, a golf course, a casino, a US$45 million deep-sea port (which can handle 10,000-ton vessels), a US$350 million airport (with a 10,500-foot runway), and US$76 million for roads totaling 110 kilometers in length (about 68.35 miles).28 A 2017 Belt and Road yearbook published by an affiliate of China’s Ministry of Commerce describes the Dara Sakor Project as “the biggest project of the Belt and Road initiative so far.”29  In September 2020, the Council for the Development of Cambodia (CDC) affirmed that, “based on documents filed with the CDC, UDG is not a Chinese state-owned entity but a foreign company registered at the Ministry of Commerce with 100 percent of shares held by Tianjin Union Investment Development Group Co Ltd.” 30 It is a private-owned enterprise established in 1995 and registered in China.31 In addition, the China Development Bank had underwritten US$15 million in BRI bonds in 2017 to support UDG for a resort in Cambodia, without mentioning Dara Sakor by name.32   However, the US Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) designated UDG a Chinese state-owned entity and, under the Global Magnitsky authority,33 sanctioned it in September 2020.34 The OFAC also considered UDG-funded activities in Cambodia to “have disproportionately benefitted the PRC, at the expense of the Cambodian people” because “UDG-funded activities have forced Cambodians from their land and devastated the environment, hurting the livelihoods of local communities.”35                                                   27 Press Release: Treasury Sanctions Chinese Entity in Cambodia Under Global Magnitsky Authority, US Dep’t Treasury (Sept. 15, 2020), https://perma.cc/ME67-L5B7.  28 Brenda Goh & Prak Chan Thul, In Cambodia, Stalled Chinese Casino Resort Embodies Silk Road Secrecy, Risks, Reuters (June 6, 2018), https://perma.cc/G7MF-3D67; Hannah Beech, A Jungle Airstrip Stirs Suspicions About Chinaʼs Plans for Cambodia, N.Y.

Level of Involvement of Local Companies/Workforce   In 2015, a village official told a reporter “[n]ot many local people are working for the Chinese company [USG], because it doesn’t want to hire local people as it thinks they often stop working.”36 We were unable to locate further information regarding involvement in the Dara Sakor Project by local companies or the area’s workforce.  3.  Military or Strategic Purpose of Project   There are widespread concerns that the Dara Sakor Project is being developed for China’s military or strategic purposes, in part because the project does not make economic sense.37 The Dara Sakor International Airport, which is “capable of taking some of the world’s biggest planes,”38 is being built in a province with a population of under 207,500.39 It was reported in May 2021 that construction of the airport is almost complete.40  The Dara Sakor Project would be useful to China for two purposes: to “circumvent a possible blockage of the Malacca Strait,” and to enforce “practical jurisdiction over the South China Sea.”41 The Cambodian government has repeatedly rejected concerns that the Chinese military will use Dara Sakor. The Constitution of Cambodia prohibits hosting foreign military in Cambodian territory.42 Recently, Sinn Chanserey Vutha, undersecretary of state for the State Secretariat of Civil Aviation, said “Dara Sakor International Airport will primarily be for tourists, charters or special flights serving high-class travelers principally travelling on to Dara Sakor Resort.”43                                                      36 Valentin Hitorin, Time Running Out for Villagers in Path of Resort Development, Khmer Times (Apr. 9, 2015), https://perma.cc/4GE7-74ZV.  37 Drake Long, Cambodia, China and the Dara Sakor Problem, Diplomat (Oct. 21, 2020), https://perma.cc/44GA-KC2H; Beech, supra note 28. 38 Beech, supra note 28; Prak Chan Thul, ”We Can’t Hide Anything” Say Cambodians at Alleged China Base, Reuters (July 26, 2019), https://perma.cc/6PD4-9FVT. 39 Koh Kong Travel Guides, Tourism of Cambodia, https://perma.cc/2TLN-E8QF.  40 Chea Vanyuth, Dara Sakor International Airport Close to Operation, Khmer Times (May 13, 2021), https://perma.cc/4VW3-B9NC. 41 Long, supra note 37.  42 Men Kimseng et al., US Sanctions Chinese Company Developing Resort in Cambodia, VOA (Sept. 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/8HXZ-3THX.  43 Sok Chan, Dara Sakor International Airport ‘to Open Mid-2021’, Khmer Times (Mar. 3, 2021), https://perma.cc/TZA6-Y58T. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Cambodia The Law Library of Congress 66 B.  Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant  1.  Project Overview  Completed and inaugurated in December 2018, the 400-megawatt Lower Sesan II Hydropower Plant (“Sesan Project”) is Cambodia’s largest hydropower project. The Sesan Project cost around US$800 million and took four years to complete. 44   The project is a joint venture under the BRI framework, with Chinese company Hydrolancang International Energy having a 51% stake, Cambodian company Royal Group holding 39%, and Vietnamese company EVN International holding 10%. Hydrolancang International Energy is owned by China Huaneng Group Co., Ltd.,45 which is owned by the Chinese government.46 The ownership of the dam may be transferred to the Cambodian government after 40 years of operation.47 Only 30% of the cost of the Sesan Project was funded by the joint venture’s capital, with the remaining 70% funded by “an undisclosed bank loan.”48   2.  Level of Involvement of Local Companies/Workforce   According to the China Huaneng Group’s website:  Following the mode of ”localized“ management, the power station attracts and trains Cambodian employees to participate in operation and management, providing more job opportunities for local workers and further harmonizing the relationship between the company and local communities. . . .  The power station is invested, developed and operated by Huaneng Lower Se-San River II Hydropower Co., Ltd. in the mode of BOT (Build – Operate – Transfer). All main electromechanical equipments are imported from China, aiming to promote the “going out” combining Chinese technology, Chinese equipment and Chinese management by adopting Chinese standards, and enhance the influence of “Made in China” in Cambodia and Southeast Asia.49                                                     44 Associated Press, Cambodia’s Biggest Hydropower Dam Now Producing Electricity, Bangkok Post (Dec. 17, 2018), https://perma.cc/9Y4P-PZAA. 45 The First Unit of Huaneng Lower Se-San River II Hydropower Station Started Power Generation, China Huaneng Group, https://perma.cc/E9D6-NW4V. 46 Company Overview, China Huaneng Group, https://perma.cc/P56E-RRX6. 47 Naren Kuch & Dene-Hern Chen, Agreement Signed for Construction of Lower Sesan 2 Dam, Cambodia Daily (Nov. 27, 2012), https://perma.cc/GRU4-ZDZ2.   48 Oliver Hensengerth, Regionalism, Identity, and Hydropower Dams: The Chinese-Built Lower Sesan 2 Dam in Cambodia, 46 J.

Military or Strategic Purpose of Project   We were unable to locate information on the military or strategic purpose of the project.   C.  Developments in Sihanoukville Province   1.  Project Overview  Sihanoukville has Cambodia’s only deep-water port that is a part of a vital trade route for the BRI. Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone (SSEZ) was established in 2008 and sprawls over 1,100 hectares (about 4.25 square miles). Taihu Cambodia International Economic Cooperation Investment Co. Ltd (China’s Hongdou Group)50 and the Cambodia International Investment Development Group Co Ltd jointly developed and operate it.51 According to an article, the project received performance-based subsidies from the China’s government and financing from the Jiangsu branch of the Export–Import Bank of China. Sinosure provided US$61 million in insurance for the project in its early stages. The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has financed a power plant located within the zone.52 SSEZ includes a China-Cambodia tax-free economic zone that attracts many Chinese businesses. The majority of factories in the SSEZ are run by Chinese companies.53  The Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway is also a BRI project. At 190 kilometers (118 miles), the expressway will be the longest roadway in Cambodia when operational in 2023.54 The estimated cost exceeds US$2 billion. The Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway is a public-private partnership project that is funded by the China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC)55 and the governments of Cambodia and China.56 “The expressway is being constructed under the build-operate-transfer (BOT) model. The maintenance and development costs will be collected from the users through toll booths on the road.”57 The Cambodian Ministry of Public Works and Transport selected CRBC for the construction of the expressway. “The Cambodian Government signed a risk concession agreement with CRBC in January 2018.”58                                                  50 HOdo Group Introduction, HOdo Group, https://perma.cc/SE9U-PDV9.  51 Cam McGrath, Kingdom’s Biggest SEZ to Get Even Bigger, Phnom Penh Post (Sept. 14, 2017), https://perma.cc/JGD9-94HK.  52 Sihanoukville Special Economic Zone, People’s Map of Global China (Mar. 31, 2021), https://perma.cc/W9M3-GNJV.    53 Hannah Ellis-Petersen, ”No Cambodia Left”: How Chinese Money Is Changing Sihanoukville, Guardian (July 31, 2018), https://perma.cc/U978-CXDS. 54 Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, Road Traffic Tech., https://perma.cc/BD9Y-BQMM. 55 China Road and Bridge Corporation (CRBC) is a wholly owned subsidiary of China Communications Construction Company Limited (CCCC). “As a leading international contractor of CCCC Group, CRBC has been involved in and successfully completed a range of high-profile landmark projects all over the world.” About Us: Company Profile, CRBC, https://perma.cc/TA8G-QWLB.  56 Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway, supra note 54. 57 Id. 58 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Cambodia The Law Library of Congress 68  2.  Level of Involvement of Local Companies/Workforce   A study of SSEZ construction workers found Chinese and Cambodian workers on site. The study showed differences in their wages:   a day of work for the Cambodian workforce ranged between US$8.00 and US$20, but in the vast majority of the cases fell between US$10.00 and US$15.00, with women earning a significantly lower amount (between US$8.00 and US$10.00 per day). . . . For a day of work, a Chinese worker received between US$50.00 and US$70.00.59   3.  Military or Strategic Purpose of Project   There do not appear to be concerns that China’s military will make use of the SSEZ and the Phnom Penh-Sihanoukville Expressway when completed.   Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base, on the Gulf of Thailand, predates the BRI. It is suspected that Cambodia and China have signed a secret agreement concerning the base. Although the details are not clear due to the confidential nature of the agreement, based on an earlier draft of the agreement that was seen by US officials, the United States and its allies suspect it would allow “China to use the base for 30 years, with automatic renewals for every 10 years after that,” and “to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.”60   The military installation in question covers 190 acres and once included two facilities built with US funding and one pier. It was reported that Cambodia requested but later refused funding from the United States to improve the military facilities. However, recent satellite images show that an area in the military base in question has been “cleared in apparent preparation for construction work.”61 The images also indicate that the US-funded facilities have been demolished.62 Based on the earlier draft of the agreement, China may be building one additional pier for Cambodia and another one for Chinese use at the base, and Chinese personnel may carry weapons and control access to a specific part of the base.63   Both Chinese and Cambodian governments have denied this claim. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen also denied this claim, stating that Cambodia’s constitution prohibits establishing a foreign military base within the country. China’s defense minister also denied that China is                                                  59 Ivan Franceschini, As Far Apart as Earth and Sky: A Survey of Chinese and Cambodian Construction Workers in Sihanoukville, 52(4) Critical Asian Stud. 512-29, at 519 (2020), https://perma.cc/8CMR-SFWP (available on Taylor & Francis Online by subscription). 60 Jeremy Page et al., Deal for Naval Outpost in Cambodia Furthers China’s Quest for Military Network, Wall St. J.

Public Support/Criticisms; Assessment of Projects’ Impact   A.  Studies and Assessments of the Projects  1.  Dara Sakor Project  The Dara Sakor Project has raised concerns regarding relocation, compensation, and land grabbing. The residents in many of the communities in the project’s path depended on fishing and farming. Nevertheless, they were relocated away from the coast.66 Additionally, according to a resident’s statement, the land that was prepared for relocation is poor and not suitable for cultivation. In addition, UDG offered little money in compensation, contrary to its own statement at the beginning of the project.67 The UDG employees reportedly burned villagers’ houses to remove the residents and clear out land necessary for UDG to build the Dara Sakor project.68   2.  Lower Sesan II Project  Numerous expert studies have shown that the Lower Sesan II Project “would cause a substantial drop in fish stocks, threaten over 50 fish species and alter the livelihoods and cultures of tens of thousands of people, mostly belonging to minority groups.”69 A group of 18 civil society organizations, including EarthRights International and International Rivers, called in 2014 for a halt to the project and a more accurate environmental impact assessment from the developers, citing many studies predicting various negative impacts of the project.70 For example, one study from 2012 considers the Lower Sesan II Project as one of the projects having the most significant impact on fish biomass in the Mekong, “with 9.3% drop in fish biomass basin-wide.”71 A 2015                                                  64 Id. 65 Chhengpor Aun, supra note 12.  66 Siphat Touch and Andreas Neef, Conf.

Sihanoukville  A reporter concludes that the Sihanoukville development by BRI brought many Chinese wealth, but many local Cambodians “are being driven out by the skyrocketing cost of living” although some, especially those who own land, are benefiting from it.74 Another complaint by residents is that “even though Chinese investment brings wealth, it is mainly kept within their own community. Chinese residents and visitors buy from Chinese businesses and visit Chinese restaurants and hotels, ensuring the trickle-down effect is minimal.”75   The increase in casino gambling in Sihanoukville has brought with it organized crime. Chinese investors risk being kidnapped.76 In addition, Cambodia’s immigration authority has found many Chinese are working in Sihanoukville without work permits.77 To curb the crimes, the Cambodian government banned online and arcade gambling beginning January 1, 2020. The immigration office announced that 400,000 Chinese left by the end of 2019 because of the ban.78 According to an article, a labor ministry official told local media outlets “[a]lmost 30 casinos in Sihanoukville have closed or suspended employment of all staff except security guards, and another 33 have temporarily suspended staff.”79 Many Chinese workers were left behind in Sihanoukville without pay by their former employers, and Cambodians also lost jobs.80                                                     72 Mekong Watch, Briefing Paper: Negative Impacts of the Lower Sesan 2 Dam on Cambodia (Nov. 12, 2015), https://perma.cc/98MP-552E.  73 Cambodia: Communities Impacted by Lower Sesan 2 Hydropower Project Seek IFC Dispute Resolution Process; Companies’ Responses, Bus. & Hum.

Media and Public Sentiment   Citing various political experts and commentators, foreign media generally view the BRI as China’s attempt to broaden its economic and geopolitical power and spread its culture. Some are concerned that China is embedding military strategies in its BRI projects, undermining Cambodia's independence and aggravating Cambodia’s corruption problems.81    In addition, support from major countries like United States, Australia, and Japan as well as the European Union is regarded as at risk.82 A political analyst stated that, if Cambodia continues to support China’s BRI, Cambodia might lose its benefits from Indo-Pacific geopolitics even though it may gain China’s political support.83   Some media report supporting opinions and views of the BRI. Chheang Vannarith, president of the Asian Vision Institute, expressed hope that the economic opportunities the BRI will provide to Cambodia outweigh the debt trap risks that others are concerned about.84 Further, political analyst Lao Mong Hay has claimed that most BRI projects in Cambodia are BOT projects, and thus, Cambodia should not incur any debt.85    C.  Political Support and Opposition   Cambodian King Norodom Sihamoni, during an official visit to Beijing for the Conference on Dialogue of Asian Civilizations, expressed to President Xi that “[Cambodia] stands ready to promote the Belt and Road Initiative with China.”86 Cambodia’s Prime Minister Hun Sen fully embraces and supports BRI.87 He said Cambodia would not fall into any debt trap because Cambodia accepts only BRI projects that are beneficial to Cambodia. He added that Cambodia “will negotiate and prepare projects in the interests of the nation and its people, and not increase financial burden and public debt.” Hun Sen said the BRI is very favorable to Cambodia’s economic and cultural development, referring to the SSEZ as an example.88   Sam Rainsy, the former leader of Cambodia’s now-dissolved main opposition party, wrote an article against BRI projects in Cambodia. He claimed that the BRI would put Cambodia in                                                  81 Mean Rith, Cambodia Vows to Strengthen and Advance BRI Cooperation with China and BRI Countries for Post Pandemic Recovery, Radio Free Asia (Apr. 20, 2021), https://perma.cc/FK9P-UBAK (in Khmer).   82 Andrew Nachemson, Chinese Investment in Cambodia Is Bringing Phnom Penh Closer to Beijing—and Further from the EU, S.

However, some Cambodians express environmental concerns because forests have been cleared for construction of casinos, condominium complexes, and roads on a large scale.90 Other concerns include the degree of construction quality and the lack of transparency in the Chinese projects, “especially compared to investment projects funded by other donors and development partners.”91 In addition, some residents, nongovernmental organizations, and civil society groups criticize reported land grabbing, forced evictions, unfair compensation for relocation, and corruption.92                                                       89 Sam Rainsy, Cambodia Entrapped by China’s New Silk Road Dominance, Geopolitics (May 1, 2019), https://perma.cc/P5NR-NUEK.  90 Ellis-Petersen, supra note 53.  91 Sok Kha, supra note 13. 92 Id.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 73 Malaysia Kelly Buchanan Chief, Foreign, Comparative, and  International Law Division II   SUMMARY Malaysia is China’s most significant trading partner within the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. In 2013, the relationship between the two countries was elevated to a “comprehensive strategic partnership.” In the following years, multiple agreements or memoranda of understanding (MOUs) were signed, and projects commenced under the banner of China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), including significant infrastructure and e-commerce projects. These included government-to-government arrangements and broad MOUs related to cooperation in different areas, agreements involving Malaysian state governments and Chinese businesses, and business-to-business agreements. The specific details of the content of most of these agreements is not publicly available, although information on the projects themselves and aspects of their financing is widely reported. This includes significant loans from Chinese state institutions and partnerships and investments involving both private and state-owned enterprises in both countries.   Some of the projects and deals have generated controversy in Malaysia and became linked to corruption allegations against the prime minister who initiated them, Najib Razak. A new prime minister sought to renegotiate or terminate some of the significant projects between 2018 and 2020, arguing that they imposed too great a burden on the country, and Najib was subsequently convicted of corruption offenses in 2020. However, Malaysia has maintained its overall involvement and support for the BRI and for Chinese investment in various sectors. Accusations that China has been involved in “debt-trap diplomacy” in Malaysia have been disputed by several commentators, who note the influence of domestic interests, politics, and agency with respect to BRI-linked projects. Studies on media and public sentiment in Malaysia with respect to the BRI have indicated generally positive views, with support for cautious involvement and awareness of some of the challenges and opportunities on the part of Malaysian businesses.   I.  Introduction  A.  Malaysia-China Bilateral Relationship and the BRI  The bilateral trade and investment relationship between China and Malaysia has strengthened over the past two decades. Since 2013, multiple memoranda of understanding (MOUs) and agreements have been signed by the two countries and their various enterprises in a range of fields, including MOUs and agreements that may be considered part of or related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).   In 2013, the two countries agreed to “elevate [the] China-Malaysia strategic cooperative relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, bringing the relationship to a track of \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 74 comprehensive and mature development.”1 In addition, they agreed to a “Five Year Program for Economic and Trade Cooperation (2013-2017).” The “comprehensive strategic partnership” reportedly “aimed to boost military cooperation and nearly triple two-way trade to $160 billion by 2017.”2   Between 2013 and 2017, various MOUs and agreements were signed related to a number of infrastructure projects involving Chinese funding and companies. This included eight government-to-government MOUs signed in 2015 and 14 MOUs signed in November 2016 during an official visit by the then-prime minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. At the end of that visit, a joint press statement stated that “Malaysia highly valued its place as one of the important countries under the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road) Initiative proposed by the Chinese government in 2013.”3  Between 2018 and 2020, following the election of a new coalition government (Pakatan Harapan, PH) led by Mahathir Mohamad, which replaced the previous coalition (Barisan Nasional, BN) led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party that had been in power in some form for 60 years, Malaysia sought to renegotiate some of the BRI-related infrastructure development deals with China. This came amid a corruption scandal involving former prime minister Najib, which included allegations that the cost of certain BRI projects had been inflated in order to bail out the state-owned investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhard (1MDB), from which Najib was accused of misappropriating funds. According to one author,  [t]here are numerous indications that Najib concluded very unfavourable deals with Beijing amounting to at least USD 34 billion in order to close 1MDB’s financial gap that was created by his embezzlement. Some observers say these deals aided and abetted money laundering.4  Najib was convicted of corruption offenses related to the 1MDB scandal in July 2020 and sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years. His appeal against the sentence was heard in April 2021, and he is also facing other tax and corruption-related proceedings this year.5  Throughout this period, while some agreements were revised and some projects appear to have stalled or been canceled, Malaysia continued its overall involvement in the BRI. For example, in August 2018, a joint statement by Mahathir and the premier of China’s State Council following Mahathir’s official visit to China stated, “Malaysia welcomes, supports and will continue to                                                  1 Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China (PRC), China and Malaysia, https://perma.cc/299S-L995.  2 Yantoultra Ngui, China Elevates Malaysia Ties, Aims to Triple Trade by 2017, Reuters (Oct. 4, 2013), https://perma.cc/F5V5-LT99.  3 Joint Press Statement, China & Malaysia, Nov. 2016, https://perma.cc/7HES-JC9Y.  4 Sergei Grassi, The Belt and Road Initiative in Malaysia: China’s Geopolitics and Geoeconomics Challenged by Democratic Transformation 6 (Freidrich Ebert Stiftung, Feb. 2020), https://perma.cc/QN54-85BD.  5 Kenneth Tee, Appeals Court Reserves Ruling in Najib’s SRC Conviction Appeal, Decision Date to Be Announced Later, Malay Mail (May 18, 2021), https://perma.cc/P5QH-KGGS; Khairah N.

The two sides will speed up the implementation of the MOU on Promoting Mutual Economic Development through China’s Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road Initiative, and discuss the formulation of relevant outline of cooperation plans.”6  In March 2020, the PH government collapsed and was replaced by a new coalition (Perikatan Nasional, PN) led by Prime Minister Muhyiddin Yassin,7 remaining in power as of mid-July 2021. However, in the first week of July, UMNO, the largest party in the ruling coalition, withdrew its support for Muhyiddin, which could result in a further change of government.8 In October 2020, Muhyiddin met virtually with China’s foreign minister and reportedly said “Malaysia welcomes Chinese companies to invest in Malaysia, is willing to work with China to promote cooperation under the BRI framework and further strengthen cooperation in areas including agriculture, aquaculture, electronics and digital economies.”9 According to a Chinese state media report, the Chinese foreign minister also met with his counterpart in Malaysia in October 2020. Speaking at a joint press conference, he said that  [b]oth countries have agreed to speed up the Belt and Road cooperation. The two sides will continue to advance the cooperation of the twin industrial parks, namely the China-Malaysia Qinzhou Industrial Park and the Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and other key projects to continue to release dynamism for development and boost the economic recovery and growth of both countries at a faster pace, he said, adding that China stands ready to continue to import high quality Malaysian palm oil.10  In March 2021, ahead of an official visit to China by Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, the Malaysian government stated that  Malaysia and China are close friends and partners. Bilateral relations between the two countries have grown steadily and significantly, despite the challenges of COVID-19. In year 2020, bilateral trade between both countries expanded by 4.2%, reaching RM 329.77 billion [about US$79.54 billion] in total.

Exports to China also contributed 16.2% to Malaysia’s total exports in 2020.11  Following the meeting, a Chinese foreign ministry spokesperson said that “[g]oing forward, the two sides will launch a high-level committee on cooperation to further synergize development strategies for high-quality BRI cooperation.”12 According to an article on the foreign ministry’s website, Hishammuddin said that   [t]he high-quality Belt and Road cooperation between the two countries is pushing Malaysia-China relations to a new phase. Malaysia hopes to learn from China’s experience in pandemic prevention and control, continue to boost bilateral cooperation in various areas in the post-pandemic period, and strengthen cooperation in the fields of energy, investment, and food security under the framework of the Belt and Road Initiative.13   B.  Goals and Interests  In terms of China’s geopolitical and economic goals, one author wrote in February 2020 that “Malaysia’s centrality in Southeast Asia and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), as well as its location at the midpoint of maritime and overland East-West trade routes make it pivotal to the BRI.”14 Furthermore, as outlined above, “Malaysian-Chinese relations have developed historically. Malaysia is China’s most important ASEAN trading partner, while the PRC has been Malaysia’s most important trading partner for the last decade, and since 2016, its biggest investor.”15  In terms of Malaysia’s interests and strategic objectives, the director of the Institute of China Studies at the University of Malaya in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, has stated that  [d]iplomatically Malaysia understands China sees support for the BRI as an important indicator of how countries assess their relationship with China. Kuala Lumpur wants to preserve a stable and positive relationship with Beijing and is willing to give strong rhetorical support to the BRI. But beyond that, there is also a genuine belief among many politicians and policymakers in Malaysia, across the political divide, that Chinese investment into the infrastructure sector in Malaysia potentially could bridge the gap of regional economic balances in Malaysia. Moreover, Chinese capital, technology, and talent can be well harnessed to support Malaysia’s next phase of economic development and upgrade its industrial chain to a more technologically advanced stage. From 1970s and 1990s, Malaysia relied a lot on Western and Japanese capital and technology during its                                                  11 Press Release, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Malaysia, Official Visit of YB Dato’ Seri Hishammuddin Tun Hussein, Minister of Foreign Affairs of Malaysia, to the People’s Republic of China, 1-2 April 2021 (Mar. 31, 2021), https://perma.cc/H5AE-JMRK.  12 Transcript, Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Hua Chunying’s Regular Press Conference on April 2, 2021, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC (Apr. 2, 2021), https://perma.cc/2WZB-42L7.  13 Wang Yi Holds Talks with Malaysian Foreign Minister Hishammuddin Hussein, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the PRC (Apr. 1, 2021), https://perma.cc/ETS7-SMLD.  14 Grassi, supra note 4, at 3. 15 Id. at 4. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 77 early phase of industrialization. China is now a major economy (though not the only one), that is able to replicate that role for Malaysia’s economic and technological development.16  C.  BRI Investments and Debt  One article that discussed the November 2016 agreements and their implications for the Malaysian economy stated that the estimated value of the 14 MOUs and agreements was RM143.64 billion (about US$34.5 billion). However, it noted that “[a]s there are no details on how this figure was arrived at, one can only make some rough estimate of the economic value of  some of these deals based on details from the media including the press reports on related projects announced prior to Najib’s visit to China.”17 In addition, according to the consultancy company PWC, a further RM31 billion (about US$7.5 billion) worth of additional MOUs were signed between Chinese and Malaysian companies in May 2017.18  According to data from the China Global Investment Tracker, cumulatively from 2013 to 2018, “Malaysia was the largest recipient of China-sourced investment and construction contracts in Southeast Asia, receiving some $35 billion.”19  According to a New York Times article, Mahathir Mohamad was elected in 2018 “with a mandate that included getting the country out from under its suffocating debt—roughly $250 billion of it, some of it owed to Chinese companies.”20 Mahathir stated that three existing projects involving China and Chinese companies, the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL), Multi-Product Pipeline, and Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline, were overpriced, created no local jobs, and would bankrupt Malaysia.21 He further “accused China of ensnaring Malaysia in a debt trap in order to seize strategically significant assets.”22 However, one author argues that while many observers were quick to opine that Malaysia under Mahathir “was ‘pushing back’ against Beijing’s BRI, ‘confronting’ China’s assertiveness in the South China Sea, and ‘resisting’ Chinese hegemony in the region,” these views “are too simplistic.”23 Despite suspending the three major projects, he allowed many other China-related projects to proceed. He also “repeatedly stressed Malaysia’s support for both the BRI and Chinese investments” and, during his visit to China in August 2018,                                                  16 Mercy A.

The loans were provided by the Export-Import Bank of China (also referred to as Exim Bank) and were to be repaid over 20 years at an annual interest rate of 3.25%.25 The remaining 15% of the project cost would be funded by Islamic bonds.26 In addition, a 2018 article stated that Malaysia had “already secured around [US]$34bn of loans for infrastructure projects under China’s Belt and Road initiative.”27 For example, the Export-Import Bank of China had also “provided a USD 800 million low-interest rate loan to Malaysia to build the 22.5 kilometre second Penang bridge, the longest cross-sea bridge in Southeast Asia.”28  An analysis of China’s investment in Malaysia in 2018 found that Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) “increased after 2014 and is spread over diverse sectors,”29 with Malaysia having “tapped on the BRI to increase flows of FDI into the country.”30 The paper states that there is “no mutually agreed list of BRI projects between Malaysia and China,” but that the 14 MOUs signed in 2016 are frequently attributed to BRI projects.31 The analysis showed that “besides transport, real estate is a big recipient, with the partnership between Country Gardens and supposedly the Johor state government to develop Forest City as announced in 2013, being the largest thus far. Other non-manufacturing recipients include agriculture, finance, and technology, indicating a diverse range of investments.”32 In terms of loans, it explains that  [g]overnment to government projects are or will be primarily funded through loans that are transacted through non-affiliated companies, with China providing the technology needed. The data on these transactions are not captured by traditional FDI data since they do not comply with the standard definition of FDI. Instead, these transactions are registered as “Other investments” in Malaysia’s Balance of Payments data, which is also unpublished by country, unlike FDI data. . . . FDI data therefore understate the extent of                                                  24 Id.

The total amount of loans undertaken for financing these types of projects is unknown, but a good indicator is that a simply calculated average of the loan amount of the ECRL project alone over the projected duration of eight years made up as much as 16.6% of net FDI flows to Malaysia in 2016. It is unclear whether the annual loan amount of all the loan-financed projects will exceed the net inflows of Chinese FDI into Malaysia at some point in the future.33  While some, including former prime minister Mahathir and the PH government, consider that the various agreements with the Chinese government and Chinese companies have resulted in unmanageable debt and insufficient local benefits, one article argues that   the IMF . . . judged Malaysia’s public debt to be ‘manageable’ in late 2017 and predicted it would decline steadily relative to GDP in the period to 2022. Malaysia’s supposed pushback was also rather modest. Only four BRI projects were suspended; others proceeded or were even revived from suspension. Even the ECRL eventually went ahead, albeit at reduced cost. The PH coalition also reasserted its support for the BRI and continued Malaysia’s economic engagement with China.34  The article further argues that decisions to leave other projects involving China untouched “reflects the entrenched power of the politico-business interests involved in Malaysia’s political economy, which the 2018 election did little to dislodge.”35 This includes vested interests among the different political parties with connections to various businesses. The article argues that “[t]hese vested interests constrained PH Finance Minister Lim Guan Eng to renegotiate rather than scrap many inflated projects, including those with no Chinese involvement.”36 In a separate article, one of the authors further stated that Malaysia debt distress “did not arise predominantly from the granting of predatory Chinese loans, but rather from the misconduct of local elites and Western-dominated financial markets,”37 and that  [t]he common narrative about China’s BRI projects in Malaysia is that it was seeking influence over the strategically important Malacca Straits. The debt-trap narrative was further fuelled by claims that Beijing had inflated loans for the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) and two gas pipeline projects in order to bail out the troubled sovereign wealth fund 1Malaysia Development Berhad (1MDB). When the Pakatan Harapan (PH) coalition surprisingly unseated the long-standing United Malay National Organisation (UMNO) led coalition, it suspended the projects, leading pundits to claim that PH was spearheading an anti-BRI pushback.  The ECRL and pipelines deal was actually proposed by former Malaysian prime minister Najib Razak and his crony Jho Low to cover up their misuse of billions of 1MDB funds for political and personal gain. Their criminal misconduct, which recently landed Najib Razak in jail, was facilitated by Western financiers including Goldman Sachs, not Beijing.

(Sept. 9, 2020), https://perma.cc/BVW8-7CMX.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 80 ECRL was not proposed by China but had been part of Malaysian development planning for almost a decade prior to its initiation in 2016.  The Malaysian government never fell into debt distress and there has been no prospect of any asset seizures. It is likely that Chinese authorities agreed to the deal because it seemed to be a low risk way of maintaining relations with a friendly government, given that Malaysia guaranteed the loan and that UMNO had ruled Malaysia since independence. PH’s shock win upended these assumptions. The new government did not cancel the ECRL, but instead negotiated the price down and secured more work for Malaysian construction firms.38  II.  Legal and Policy Framework   As indicated above, Malaysia and China, and entities within those two countries, have signed multiple MOUs and agreements related to projects that are seen as being connected to the BRI. This includes agreements for construction and financing, in addition to broader MOUs, such as between government agencies, on cooperation in certain sectors. In terms of the policy and institutional settings related to the BRI in Malaysia, one author wrote in 2020 that  [t]he tendency of Chinese companies to go ‘incentive shopping’ in different Malaysian states is pushing the federal government towards the implementation of stricter requirements on transparency, stronger monitoring of the FDI approval process, and towards the re-drafting of investment incentives. This shift has led to a higher emphasis on localization and on prioritizing high-tech investments to develop Malaysia as one of the digital and automation hubs in Southeast Asia. Furthermore, the country is increasingly turning down investments related to polluting industries while implementing stricter environmental requirements and providing incentives for green FDI. The Malaysian Ministry of International Trade and Investment (MITI) established the Belt and Road Initiative National Secretariat (BRINS) right after the signing of the BRI Memorandum of Understanding between Malaysia and China. In 2019, BRINS was renamed China Section to reflect better the work of the department, which also encompasses other non-BRI related bilateral matters.39  The following examination of relevant MOU agreements is non-exhaustive. While statements from the two governments and various news sources often name particular documents, the majority could not be located through publicly available sources.  A.  2013 Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and “Twin Parks” Agreements  As stated above, in October 2013, China and Malaysia agreed to “elevate” their relationship to a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership and signed the Five Year Program for Economic and Trade Cooperation (2013-2017).40 At the same meeting, the two governments signed the “Agreement on the Establishment of the China-Malaysia Qinzhou Industrial Park and the Agreed Minutes on the                                                  38 Id. 39 Angela Tritto, The Belt and Road Initiative as a Catalyst for Institutional Development: Evidence from Indonesia, Malaysia, and Myanmar, Belt and Road, HKTDC (Apr. 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/THY4-96P2.   40 China and Malaysia, supra note 1. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 81 Establishment of Joint Cooperation Council on China-Malaysia Qinzhou Industrial Park and Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park Between the Ministry of Commerce and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.”41   Prior to this, according to a speech by Najib announcing the launch of the MCKIP in February 2013, five strategic documents were signed at that time to “kick-start the inflow of investments”:  First, the Shareholders Agreement between the Malaysia Consortium and China Consortium for the Establishment of MCKIP Joint Venture Company;  Second, the Memorandum of Understanding of Investment between the East Coast Economic Region Development Council (ECERDC) and Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group for three projects in the park: a steel plant, an aluminium plant and an oil palm refinery;  Third, the Memorandum of Understanding between Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group and Rimbunan Hijau Group for the investment in the oil palm refinery in MCKIP;  Fourth, the Memorandum of Understanding between IJM Corporation Berhad and Guangxi Beibu Gulf International Port Group on the Development and Expansion of Kuantan Port; and  Last but not least, the Framework Agreement on Financing Cooperation between China Development Bank Corporation and the Master Developer of MCKIP comprising a Malaysia consortium and a China consortium, which will involve collaboration between the parties in the areas of project financing and financial consulting services for the MCKIP project.42  B.  2015 China-Malaysia Port Alliance MOU  According to reports, in November 2015 eight government-to-government MOUs were signed that related to “various fields,” including bilateral defense cooperation, cooperation in the field of education, and agricultural cooperation. These included an MOU between the Malaysia Port Alliance and the China Port Alliance.43 According to the China-Malaysia Port Alliance (CMPA) website,   [u]nder the initiative of the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road initiative, the Ministry of Transport (MOT) Malaysia has taken the initiative to establish a Port Alliance with China ports which currently consists of 9 Malaysian Port Authorities and 12 Chinese Ports.  On 23rd November 2015, The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between the Malaysian Port Alliance and China Port Alliance called China-Malaysia Port Alliance                                                  41 Id. 42 Dato’ Sri Najib Tun Abdul Razak, Speech at Pahang: The Official Launch of Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP) (Feb. 5, 2013), https://perma.cc/32T6-RGDB.  43 Malaysia, China Ink Eight MoUs, Agreements in Various Fields, Malay Mail (Nov. 23, 2015), https://perma.cc/6XTU-2UDL.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 82 (CMPA) was signed by Minister of Transport and witnessed by Prime Minister [sic] from both countries.  The scope of the MoU includes Port Studies, Training and Apprenticeship, Technical Assistance, Traffic Development and Promotion of Services.  Further to the CMPA MoU, MOT Malaysia has appointed Port Klang Authority (PKA) to be the Secretariat for Malaysia and at the same time MOT China has also appointed China Ports & Harbours Association (CPHA) as the Secretariat for Chinese Ports.  The parties agreed to establish the meeting mechanism of the CMPA to further implement relevant actions to be implemented in strengthening communication and cooperation between ports of China and Malaysia and to accelerate long-term development of port business based on pragmatic conditions.  The objective of CMPA establishment is to establish mutual assistance and joint co-operation particularly in the fields of port studies, communications and cooperation between the Parties.44  The MOU, which is available on the CMPA website, includes articles setting out the purpose and form of cooperation, its scope (including port studies, training and apprenticeship, exchange of information, technical assistance, and traffic development and promotion of services between the ports), and provides for an action plan program, financial arrangements to cover expenses for the cooperative activities, as well as containing articles on the protection of intellectual property rights and confidentiality. Article 9 provides that each party reserves the right “for reasons of national security, national interest, public order or public health” to temporarily suspend the implementation of the MOU. Article 10 deals with entry into force, duration, and termination (requiring three months’ notice), and article 11 provides for revision, modification, and amendment of the MOU. Article 12 states that disputes “shall be settled amicably by consultation or negotiation between the Parties without reference to any third party or international tribunal.”45 There is a further MOU signed between two particular ports “for the establishment of a sister-port relationship.”46  C.  2016 MOUs and Agreements  According to reports, the following were the 14 MOUs and agreements signed following the January 2016 bilateral meeting:  1. Engineering, procurement, construction and commissioning agreement between Malaysia Rail Link Sdn Bhd, China Communications Construction Co Ltd (CCCC) and China Communications Construction Company (M) Sdn Bhd (CCCCM).                                                   44 Background, China – Malaysia Port Alliance (CMPA), https://perma.cc/472D-36V4.  45 Memorandum of Understanding Between Malaysia Port Alliance and China Port Alliance for the Establishment of a Port Alliance, Kuala Lumpur, Nov. 23, 2015, https://perma.cc/P76M-H3QU.  46 Memorandum of Understanding Between the Port Kelang Authority, Malaysia, and Xiamen Port Authority, China, for the Establishment of a Sister-Port Relationship, Xiamen, Oct. 28, 2015, https://perma.cc/W4ED-87MY.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 83 2.

In addition, according to the China Ministry of Commerce, on the same date, during the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation, “China International Trade Representative and Vice Minister of Commerce Fu Ziying and Malaysian Minister of Transportation Liow Tiong Lai signed the Memorandum of Understanding between Chinese Ministry of Commerce and Malaysian Ministry of Transportation on Cooperation of Transportation Infrastructure.”54 The MOU  made it clear that, under the framework of the laws, regulations, policies of their own and the MOU, and on the basis of the principle of equality and mutual benefit, the two parties will make efforts to strengthen, promote and develop comprehensive cooperation on transportation infrastructure between the two countries. The cooperation fields will include railway, ports, airports and the other infrastructure projects agreed by the two parties. The two parties will establish the joint working team on transportation infrastructure cooperation, so as to provide convenience to transportation infrastructure                                                  48 Introduction, Melaka Gateway, https://perma.cc/9RVY-SE4W.  49 Bandar Malaysia Master Plan, SOM, https://perma.cc/64VL-4J6L.  50 About Green Technology Park (GTP), Green Technology Park, Pahang, https://greentechnologypark.com/about-us/. 51 Mike Lo, Malaysian Government Welcome China’s Hebei Xinwuan Steel Group to Build 3 Million Tonne Steel Plant in Sarawak, Yieh Corp.

According to a news report, these included a strategic alliance agreement between Johor Corporation and Siasun Robot Investment Co. Ltd to develop 400 hectares of land for the Robotics Future City in Johor; an MOU between Yayasan Hartanah Bumiputera Sarawak, Consortium of Huanqiu Contracting & Engineering Co, and MACFeam Sdn Bhd. for the development of a methanol and derivatives complex in Sarawak; an MOU between KAJ Development and Power China, Shenzhen Yantian Port Group and Rizhao Port Group, to jointly develop Melaka Gateway; a cooperation agreement to promote and develop the Malaysian Innovation Cluster within the China-Malaysia Qinzhou Industrial Park; an exclusive agent agreement between Agrofresh International Sdn Bhd and Dashang Co. Ltd for the supply of Cavendish Banana and Tropical Fruits; and investment for a mixed development, “The Shore,” in Sabah.56  E.  2018 Statement and Agreements  At the August 2018 visit to China by then-prime minister Mahathir, the two countries agreed to actively discuss the formulation of the “Five-year Program for Economic and Trade Cooperation for the period of 2018-2022.” They also agreed to “jointly push forward the cooperation on “Two Countries, Twin Parks”, namely China-Malaysia Qinzhou Industrial Park (CMQIP) and Malaysia-China Kuantan Industrial Park (MCKIP) through the active role of the Joint Cooperation Council on CMQIP and MCKIP.”57 In addition, the two sides “welcomed the renewal or signing of various agreements and memoranda of understanding (MOU) during the visit,” which covered various sectors and matters, but did not appear to relate to BRI projects.58  F.  2019-2021 Revised Agreements  Also in August 2018, Mahathir said he was “halting a contract for the China Communications Construction Company [CCCC] to build the East Coast Rail Link [ECRL], thought to have cost the government around $20 billion, along with a $2.5 billion agreement for an arm of a Chinese energy giant to construct gas pipelines.”59 At the time, the construction costs for the ECRL had increased to RM65.5 billion (about US$15.8 billion). Previously, Malaysia’s finance minister had stated that the ECRL would proceed, as that would be cheaper than canceling the deal, for which RM20 billion (about US$4.8 billion) had already been paid out to CCCC.60 In April 2019, the government announced that a new agreement had been signed, enabling the resumption of the                                                  55 Id.  56 MoUs for RM31b Investments Signed in China, Sun Daily (May 14, 2017), https://perma.cc/GS2H-4U67.  57 Joint Statement Between the Government of the People’s Republic of China and the Government of Malaysia, Beijing, Aug. 20, 2018, supra note 6. 58 Id. 59 Jones & Hameiri, supra note 22. 60 Malaysia Admits It’s Too Late to Cancel China’s $14bn East Coast Rail Deal, supra note 25. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 86 project, with costs for phases 1 and 2 reduced to RM44 billion (about US$10.6 billion), while the length of the route was shortened to 640 kilometers from 688 kilometers (about 400 miles from 427 miles).61   Subsequently, the Muhyiddin government announced in April 2021 that it had again revised the deal to establish “ECRL 3.0,” which increased the costs to RM50 billion (about US$12 billion) and extended the length to 665 kilometers (about 413 miles).62  As outlined in Section III of this report, below, it appears that other projects were also canceled or delayed during the past two years, resulting in amendments to or withdrawals from agreements.  G.  2021 MOU on the Establishment of a High-Level Committee to Promote Cooperation in the Post-Covid-19 Era  According to reports, at the meeting between the foreign ministers of Malaysia and China in April 2021, an MOU on establishing a committee to promote cooperation between the two countries in the post-Covid-19 era was signed. This committee  would act as an overarching bilateral mechanism, overseeing the implementation of all understandings and provide policy guidance for all aspects of Malaysia-China relations on pandemic preparedness and response, trade and investment, commodity, food security, science, technology and innovation, travel facilitation as well as “Belt and Road” initiative projects.63  In addition, according to reports in November 2020, Malaysia and China were finalizing the “first draft of the second cycle of the Five-Year Programme for Economic and Trade Relations” for the period 2021 to 2025.64 Further information on this document in subsequent months was not located.                                                     61 Yiswaree Palansamy, ECRL: So, What’s the Deal with Pakatan’s New Deal?, Malay Mail (Apr. 16, 2019), https://perma.cc/A6LT-3LCB.  62 Malaysia Accepts 14% Cost Increase in China-led Rail Project, Taking Longer Route, Reuters (Apr. 5, 2021), https://perma.cc/55RL-4KMF.  63 Adib Povera, Malaysia, China Agree on Health Certs, Ink MoU to Enhance Post-Pandemic Cooperation, New Straits Times (Apr. 2, 2021), https://perma.cc/EM3H-SCTW.

Major “Flagship” Projects    The following appear to be the most significant infrastructure and development projects in Malaysia connected in some way to the BRI:  • ECRL, • MCKIP and Kuantan Port, • Bandar Malaysia, • Forest City, • Gemas-Johor Bahru electrified double-tracking railway project,65  • Melaka Gateway and Deepwater Port,  • Malaysia-Singapore High Speed Rail (HSR), • Trans-Sabah Gas Pipeline (TSGP), • Melaka/Port Dickson-Jitra Multi-Product Pipeline (MPP), and • an oil and gas pipeline connecting Melaka to a Petronas plant in Johor.  In addition, the Digital Free Trade Zone,66 launched in 2017 in partnership with China’s Alibaba Group, “aims to connect Malaysia’s SMEs [small and medium enterprises] globally through Alibaba-inspired electronic world trade platforms that are being established to support greater exchange between Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) countries.”67  However, one author argues that  [o]ne should be cautious . . . in treating China’s involvements in all these projects as the same. Some were completely private initiatives, some were initiated by the governments of both sides but with significant private sector participation, and some were government-to-government projects. Some projects were driven by local (state-level) governments. The financing also differed from project to project, and not all of them would result in the increase of debt. Some projects are not strictly speaking “investment,” rather the Chinese companies only won the construction contracts, although not always under the most transparent manner. Hence, the tendency by certain foreign and domestic media alike to lump together all these projects as if they’re all the same and constitutive components of a strategically designed “debt-trap” diplomacy by China is misleading.  In addition, one should also take note that China’s investment in the manufacturing sector in Malaysia has been extensive and increasing. Chinese companies have invested in steel, solar energy, glass, locomotive, automobile, telecommunications and many other sectors                                                  65 See Rizalman Hammim, Gemas-JB Double-Tracking Project to Be Completed by Oct 2022 [NSTTV], New Straits Times (June 21, 2020), https://perma.cc/9QGD-KSK7.  66 DFTZ: Digital Free Trade Zone, Malaysia Digital Econ.

This side of China’s economic presence in Malaysia is however usually overlooked.68  A study of two of the largest projects, the ECRL and the MCKIP, highlighted some of the differences in approaches, stating that “[t]he role of the central state is considerably more noticeable in the ECRL while it is comparatively less visible in the MCKIP.”69 Furthermore,   with respect to the ECRL, the state-business relations are relatively cohesive, marked by strong coordination between the Chinese central state and CCCC, the SOE concerned. The state-business relations undergirding the MCKIP is more decentralised as business expansion has been primarily orchestrated by provincial authorities and a provincially-owned SOE using mostly market-based mechanisms in the absence of detectable directives from the central state. Lastly, the implementation of both the ECRL and the MCKIP infrastructure projects is conditioned and constrained by the host economy’s political-institutional environment, undermining the implicit assumption that the agency of local stake-holders is unimportant in the study and operationalisation of Chinese financial statecraft.70  A.  Canceled Projects  The three pipeline projects referred to above, the TSGP, MPP, and Melaka-Johor pipeline, were terminated in September 2018 by the PH government.71 At the time of their cancellation, it was reported that the Chinese state-owned company involved, China Petroleum Pipeline Co Ltd (CPP), had issued a statement saying that “CPP understands and respects that the decision is due to economic and financial reasons. CPP will proceed to discuss with the asset owner/ Malaysian government for a fair and equitable compensation for the cancellation of the projects.”72 Previously, former prime minister Mahathir had said that the projects were too expensive and Malaysia could not afford them. He noted that “compensations would have to be paid to Chinese contractors due to the deferments, only because of the poor deal-making ability of the previous Barisan Nasional government,” stating  [w]hat kind of stupidity is it that to strike a deal without a proper exit clause. Exit clauses are supposed to be of mutual interests, but in these contracts, it burdens the Malaysian government.                                                   68 Ngeow Chow-Bing, Malaysia-China Cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative Under the Pakatan Harapan Government: Changes, Continuities, and Prospects, in NIDS ASEAN Workshop 2019 “China’s BRI and ASEAN” 25-42, https://perma.cc/5UD9-W6PR.  69 Guanie Lim et al., Chinese Financial Statecraft in Southeast Asia: An Analysis of China’s Infrastructure Provision in Malaysia, Pac.

In the end, Malaysia and Singapore “were reportedly unable to settle disagreements after Malaysia pushed for structural changes to the project and to fast-track construction by two years.”76 Subsequently, in April 2021, the governments of Malaysia and Singapore announced that a settlement had been finalized with respect to the termination of the bilateral agreement on the HSR project, stating that a “payment of SGD102,815,576.00 (RM320,270,519.24) [about US$77.25 million] has been made by the Government of Malaysia to reimburse the Government of the Republic of Singapore for costs incurred for the development of the HSR Project, and in relation to the extension of suspension of the HSR Project.”77 According to a Singapore law firm, “[t]he termination payment received by Singapore would ordinarily be considered insufficient, being less than half of the actual costs incurred by Singapore, but in the context of the geo-political backdrop, it bodes well in that it leaves the door open for future collaboration in transport and infrastructure projects on a government to government level.”78  The Melaka Gateway project was also effectively canceled in November 2020 by the Melacca state government, which stated in a letter that the developer, KAJ Development Sdn Bhd, had “failed to complete the reclamation works after three years as contracted.”79 However, the KAJ                                                  73 P Prem Kumar et al., ECRL, Gas Pipeline Cancellation to Ease Debt Load, Malaysian Res.

In February 2021, a court dismissed KAJ Development’s application for judicial review of the state government’s decision, ruling that there was no public law element involved. The developer subsequently lodged an appeal with the Court of Appeal.81  B.  Select Ongoing Projects  1.  ECRL  The Chinese company contracted to construct the ECRL, CCCC, states on its website that the railway is “a flagship project” of the BRI and is “the largest overseas project of Chinese companies under construction and will continue to be the most eye-catching mega project both in Malaysia and in the entire South-east Asia.”82  According to the study referred to above,   the ECRL boasts an apparent geopolitical undertone as it connects the Kuantan Port . . . on the east coast of Peninsular Malaysia to Port Klang on the west coast. This potential land bridge could provide a ‘significant resolution’ to China’s over-reliance on the US Navy-patrolled Straits of Malacca, a problem known to Beijing as the ‘Malacca Dilemma’. The project’s geo-economic and energy security appeal to the Chinese central state was witnessed during the ground-breaking ceremony of the ECRL on 9 August 2017. A high-level Chinese delegation headed by State Councillor Wang Yong attended the much-publicised event. Wang was accompanied by SASAC Chairman Xiao Yaqing, Vice Foreign Minister Zhang Ming, and then Chinese Ambassador to Malaysia Huang Huikang. One can deduce the strategic importance of the ECRL from the excerpts of State Councillor Wang’s speech:  [The] ECRL will be the flagship project of both countries, a model of China-Malaysia collaboration . . . Malaysia is located at the heart of Southeast Asia, with maritime and land routes interlinking the entire region, a location of utmost geostrategic value . . . I hope China and Malaysia will seize this historic opportunity to promote the Belt and Road Initiative, thereby achieving win-win outcomes. . . .’83  As outlined above, the new PH government sought to renegotiate the arrangements for the project soon after it came to power in 2018. The above study provides further information on the positions, interests, and tactics of those involved:  Merely three months after returning as Prime Minister, Mahathir, in his official visit to China in August 2018, announced in the Great Hall of the People in Beijing after meeting                                                  80 Id.

Construction Company (M) Sdn Bhd, https://perma.cc/K22A-D9FG.  83 Lim et al., supra note 69. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 91 with Chinese Premier Li Keqiang that the ECRL would be ‘deferred until such time we can afford, and maybe we can reduce the cost also if we do it differently’ (Goh, 2018). Mahathir went further, saying: ‘We do not want a situation where there is a new version of colonialism happening because poor countries are unable to compete with rich countries’. Such an announcement made international news, but several interviewees made the point that Mahathir’s intention behind the bold announcement was more nuanced, with him wanting to re-negotiate the terms of the original project rather than cancelling it outright.  The subsequent development of the ECRL project demonstrates that Mahathir’s unorthodox tactics had seemingly achieved his goals of re-negotiating the project to the advantage of Malaysia. CCCC had originally insisted the project went on or 22 billion Malaysian ringgits worth of compensation and penalty be paid to it if the Malaysian side unilaterally terminated the ECRL (TODAY, 2018). It also refused to recognise the ECRL as a G2G project, claiming that it was a purely business-to-business undertaking. CCCC also turned down Malaysia’s offer of railway re-routing as the company was wary of losing money (or earning less than initial projections) out of the project (Malgeri, 2019). The apparent upper hand of CCCC over Malaysia was confirmed by Daim Zainuddin, special envoy of Mahathir for the purpose of re-negotiations: ‘There is a binding agreement . . .  it may be one sided, but it is equally binding [on Malaysia]. . . . If you are silly enough to sign the agreement, then it’s your problem’ (Jaipragas, 2019).  This impasse was eventually broken when the powerful National Development Reform Commission (NDRC) of China stepped in. Clearly, China’s central authorities realised that its global ambitions would be thwarted if the international community took the ECRL as a positive example of Chinese ‘debt trap diplomacy’. At the time, the ‘debt trap diplomacy’ narrative was gaining momentum after the opposition parties in several developing countries (such as Sri Lanka, Malaysia and the Maldives) came to power by attacking their respective incumbents for a perceived over-friendliness to the BRI and accusations of them being captured by Chinese financial largess (Malgeri, 2019). The NDRC moved to prevent further escalations, especially when President Xi Jinping was to host the second Belt and Road Forum (BRF) for International Cooperation in late April 2019. Expecting the attendance of important national leaders and international economic organisations, the Chinese national leadership and the NDRC saw in Mahathir an influential, senior political figure in the developing world and Muslim community. As an ‘old friend’ since at least the 1980s, Mahathir has consistently championed China’s growing role in the international arena and Asian regionalism (Khoo, 2019). Therefore, a rapprochement with Malaysia would have sent the perfect signal, showing how China was receptive to international concerns and keen on supplying win-win solutions and common prosperity. This re-calibration also meat [sic] that pressure was applied from the highest echelons of the Chinese national government on CCCC whose commercial interests eventually yielded to national foreign policy goals in the end (Malgeri, 2019).  On 15 April 2019, about two weeks before the BRF took place in Beijing, Mahathir’s office announced that it had successfully re-negotiated the terms of the ECRL project with CCCC (PMO, 2019). Among other changes, the construction cost was reduced from 55 billion to 44 billion Malaysian ringgits. In addition to reducing the principal repayment amount, this would also lighten the financing interest payment. The railway track was also re-routed, passing through five states (Negri Sembilan added to Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, and Selangor) and Putrajaya rather than the previous four states, allowing more states to access the economic benefits of the improved deal. For CCCC, while it has been retained as the main contractor, it now has a longer-term stake in the project after agreeing to participate in the operation and maintenance of the ECRL through a 50/50 joint venture arrangement \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 92 with the Malaysians. CCCC also signed a memorandum of understanding to develop industrial parks along the railway aiming to transform the transport corridor into an economic corridor. This agreement, when realised, involves the establishment of logistics hubs at transport interchanges to promote connectivity and transportation of goods, and transit-oriented development stations to promote new development and to support the growth of industrial parks (Zainul, 2019).84  As also noted above, the contract with CCCC was further revised by the current PN government, with an agreement for “ECRL 3.0” reached in March 2021. This involved a realignment back to the original route, with particular impacts in Selangor, and an increase to the cost of the contract. The new plan was met with further controversy, including accusations by the Selangor state government that it had not been consulted and that the move was a political ploy to swing voters in particular areas in the next general election.85 The transport minister argued that “the decision to revert the East Coast Rail Link (ECRL) project to a northern alignment in Selangor was to maximise the project’s economic and technical benefits.”86   2.  MCKIP and Kuantan Port Development  The CMQIP and the MCKIP, which were launched in April 2012 and February 2013 respectively, are “sister” industrial parks established based on the “partnership between Malaysia Consortium and China Consortium.”87 One author notes that the MCKIP was actually proposed by then-prime minister Najib in April 2012 when he was in China launching the Qinzhou Industrial Park.88  In 2019, the two countries agreed to “step up cooperation in developing the flagship twin industrial parks in an effort to increase bilateral economic cooperation,” and Malaysia’s deputy minister for international trade and industry stated that “the progress made through the MCKIP and CMQIP would be further enhanced with greater integration of the twin parks into the China-proposed Belt and Road Initiative.”89  According to the above study,  [i]n terms of shareholding structure, a Malaysian consortium holds 51 per cent of the MCKIP’s equity. This Malaysian consortium is in turn owned by two Malaysian SOEs (combined 60 per cent equity) and one private firm (40 per cent equity). The MCKIP’s remaining 49 per cent equity is held by Qinzhou Investment Company (5 per cent) and                                                  84 Id.

The Kuantan port is also the BGP’s inaugural overseas investment in seaports. . . .  While producing a variety of commodities, covering steel products, porcelain, energy application systems, concrete panels, and solar energy cells, the largest investor to date is the Alliance Steel Group integrated steel mill. . . .   Besides its role as an investor, Guangxi BGP also takes the initiative to play a coordinating and facilitating role, promoting the MCKIP to other Chinese firms from Guangxi and beyond. Thanks to the BGP’s influence, new investments by Guangxi Zhongli Enterprise Group (a Guangxi-based private firm, hereinafter Zhongli) and Guangxi Investment Group (GIG, a Guangxi province-owned SOE) were channelled to the MCKIP. . . .   Like Alliance Steel, the shared growth strategy of Zhongli and GIG revolves around the opportunity to ‘use’ Malaysia as an avenue to work around tariff measures imposed by the West against Chinese manufacturers. In terms of financing, our desk research and fieldwork did not lead to concrete evidence suggesting that they received direct central government financial support. Their investment into the MCKIP is in fact funded through commercial loans from a consortium of Chinese retail banks including China Construction Bank, Agricultural Bank of China and others. . . .90  3.  Forest City  Forest City, in the Malaysian state of Johor, involves four reclaimed islands close to the border with Singapore. It has been called “probably the most ambitious property project in Malaysia” and is in a special status zone (the Iskandar Malaysia Special Economic Zone).91 The project, launched in 2014, came to be pitched as part of the BRI.92 The official website states that “the newly-built Forest City will be a smart and green futuristic city that combines environment, technology and cutting-edge technology to create an ideal, idyllic and technology-driven living and working space ecosystem.”93 Furthermore, “[m]any key industries have already committed to setting up their operations here, and this will further spur regional economic growth amid an already-robust backdrop of a consolidating ASEAN community and China’s “Belt and Road” initiative.”94   According to news articles written in 2014,  [t]he venture . . . is being undertaken by Country Garden Pacific View Sdn Bhd (CGPV). According to the promoters of the project, the shareholders of CGPV are Country Garden                                                  90 Lim et al., supra note 69. 91 Khor Yu Leng, Commentary: The Rise in Johor Property Prices and the Myth that Singapore Buyers Are Responsible, CNA (Mar. 20, 2018, updated Feb. 2, 2021), https://perma.cc/H5TW-UE5S.  92 James Clark, Forest City Malaysia—A New City on Man-Made Islands near Singapore, Future Southeast Asia (Apr. 8, 2020), https://perma.cc/8K9A-SVUV.  93 About Forest City, Forest City, https://perma.cc/G2GZ-AU43.  94 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 94 Holdings (60%) and KPRJ [Kumpulan Prasarana Rakyat Johor, a Johor state agency] via Esplanade Danga 88 Sdn Bhd (40%).  But checks with the Companies Commission of Malaysia (CCM) show otherwise.  CCM records show that Sultan Ibrahim is the single largest shareholder in Esplanade with 1,998 shares, which is equivalent to a 99.9% stake. Meanwhile, former directors Amutha Vasundeven and Rabindranah Nandy each hold one share.  As of now, KPRJ has no shares in Esplanade. . . .   Instead of 40% as had always been stated by the promoters, Esplanade holds only 34% equity interest in CGPV while Country Garden Holdings holds the remaining 66%.95  According to further reports, in June 2014 the Malaysian Department of Environment issued a stop-work order pending completion of an approved environmental impact assessment (EIA), following an outcry by local fishermen. A month later, “Country Garden announced it was downsizing the project by a third, dividing it into four islands, and taking a host of other steps to demonstrate its project would be a showcase of ecological sensitivity.”96 Furthermore, “Country Garden also spent $25 million to compensate some 250 fishermen for losses in their catches, and has actively been involved in financially supporting schools and an environmental education program in Kampong Pok.”97 The government approved the EIA in January 2015, requiring the developer to abide by 81 ecologically sensitive directives, and construction resumed two months later.98  A November 2019 article in Foreign Policy argued that Forest City “is a case study in how easily Chinese investment projects that are entirely private can become boondoggles due to the interference of Chinese politics and poor Chinese management.”99 It further said that the Chinese developer “became embroiled in the machinery of domestic politics in both China and Malaysia.”100 In addition to the environmental and political issues, the article states that “corrupt local leaders seem to have captured the fund that Country Garden established to compensate local fishermen for their loss of livelihoods” and, while the developer “made some effort to employ locals in Johor,” “large swaths of Forest City’s workforce are low-wage laborers from South Asia or white-collar Chinese workers who were hired to cater to Chinese clientele.”101                                                    95 Esther Lee, Johor Sultan Is Stakeholder in Forest City Project, Edge Mkts.

Public and Media Perceptions of the BRI in Malaysia  A 2019 study on perceptions of socioeconomic, cultural, and educational implications of the BRI in Malaysia, involving interviews with businesspeople and the general public, as well as media analysis of six major newspapers, found that Malaysians were generally not yet familiar with the BRI. There was also limited coverage of it in the newspapers. Overall, however, BRI was viewed as an initiative that would benefit Malaysia in its economic, social, and cultural development, but there were concerns about the negative implications of BRI. Therefore, “most of the respondents thought Malaysia should participate in BRI but cautiously.”102  A study on public perceptions towards the BRI as reflected in articles published in two Malay newspapers between April and December 2018 found that such articles were limited and mainly focused on economic aspects of the BRI and Malaysia’s relationship with China. In fact, “[m]ost of the articles are basically clarifying the idea or concept of the BRI, rather than analyse or examine the subject. Almost all the articles highlight BRI as a win-win game and how it is beneficial to Malaysia, and to China as well.”103 Furthermore, “most articles try to relate the subject globally, but most of them end up with Malaysia and China-centred conclusions. Therefore, the main characteristic and perceptions of Malay newspapers is positive and moderate towards the BRI.”104  Another study of national newspaper articles focused on media sentiment polarity related to the Forest City project, which it described as being a “heavily publicized Chinese FDI project.”105 In particular, the study sought to “uncover if there is a correlation between the bilateral political interactions and the media sentiment towards Chinese FDI projects.”106 It found that  • “the news coverage of Forest City increased significantly in Malaysian media from 2014 to 2018. It also became a politicalized economic issue, with the average sentiment score of media shifting across time in accordance with the media’s agenda-setting.” • “the sentiment of mainstream media represented by NST [New Straits Times] remained positive, while independent media, as represented by Malaysiakini, held a negative sentiment towards Forest City.” • “there are correlations between Sino-Malaysian bilateral interactions and the sentiment polarity of the mainstream media on the issue of Forest City because the government wants positive media exposure of FDI projects due to political concerns. As for Malaysiakini, its sentiment tends to link more with the perceived economic consequences of the project instead of political factors.”                                                  102 Belt & Road Initiative in Malaysia: Public Perception of Socio-Economic, Cultural and Educational Implications, UTAR Belt & Road Strategic Res.

Local SMEs believed that Belt & Road Initiative will bring overall improvement to the infrastructure and facility development in Malaysia, and they could even foresee that this will eventually improve the living quality of local people and bring a greater business environment for both local SMEs and Chinese firms.108  However, it also found  the interview results indicated that some Malaysian SMEs found that BRI imposes numerous challenges towards their business. Based on the results, the expansion of Chinese firms to Malaysia will increase the market competition in some industries. For instance, the respondents worried that food and beverage brands from China will venture into domestic industry, which will subsequently increase the market competition in the industry. Respondents also commented that the competitive market will reduce the profit margin of local SMEs as they are not only competing with the local firms but also with the multinational companies from China.  Besides, the respondents from manufacturing industry feared that they will be forced to shut down as Chinese products are cheaper and can provide better service than that of the local manufacturers. In addition, respondents informed that they might lose their comparative advantages to China-owned firms by sharing their knowledge and skills if those firms are not keen to seek for long-run partnership. However, the respondents agreed that they will be able to overcome the challenges and transform the threat into opportunities, if they have proper way forward plan. For instance, the respondents informed that they can focus on industries in which Malaysia has the comparative advantage, such as tourism. Furthermore, the respondents also suggested that Malaysian SMEs can tap into China-owned multinational company in order to explore the international market.109  A broader study regarding engagement in the BRI in Laos, Malaysia, and Thailand, with respect to elite legitimation and host country agency, published in 2021, stated that  [a]mong the Southeast Asian cases, Malaysia’s engagement with China’s BRI has been the most receptive and regionally transformative. However, it has also been repeatedly recalibrated according to changing political circumstances.

The latter recalibration and renegotiation occur especially when inter-elite contestation and bottom-up resentment combine to increase the imperative for democratic procedural legitimation, compelling the government of the day to recalibrate the country’s BRI involvement while correcting the terms of cooperation.110                                                  110 Kuik, supra note 23, at 227.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 98 Pakistan Tariq Ahmad Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY The Pakistan part of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC). CPEC has been described as BRI’s flagship project. CPEC officially launched in April 2015 during an official visit by China’s President Xi Jinping to Pakistan. CPEC projects include four major areas: the energy sector, transportation infrastructure, the deep-sea port of Gwadar, and industrial cooperation through the development and construction of Special Economic Zones. Projects are divided into three timeframes, Phase I (2017-2020), Phase II (2020-2025), and Phase III (2025-2030). Initial investments were valued at $46 billion, while estimates as of 2020 were $62 billion.   Projects under CPEC take the form of numerous bilateral agreements and other arrangements. At the time of its official launch in 2015, both countries signed 51 agreements, memoranda of understanding (MOUs), and financing contracts. The details of these and later agreements are generally kept secret. Every CPEC project has different terms and conditions and are built and financed independently from each other. They are also financed using a variety of different structures that may involve Pakistani state entities, Chinese state-owned enterprises, Pakistani private firms, and other third parties. Project financing often include a mix of Chinese grants, government concessional low-interest loans, zero-interest loans and investments through public-private partnerships (which may involve equity financing).     CPEC infrastructure projects being developed through low-interest government concessional loans, no-interest loans, or grants are often highlighted to dispute the narrative that Pakistan is taking massive loans and that CPEC and is creating a debt burden. On the other hand, CPEC power projects have engendered particular controversy over debt sustainability; the government faces a “circular debt” problem and is negotiating with China to restructure the terms of these projects. Though some experts believe that these projects will add to Pakistan’s sovereign debt burden, there is disagreement on whether this is a deliberate strategy on the part of China to create a “debt trap” or if it is due to the need for electricity infrastructure upgrades and other poor governance/planning issues.    The Gwador port is often highlighted as a potential or likely site for a People’s Liberation Army (PLA) overseas naval base. However, it is reportedly not currently being used for a PLA base, and both governments have downplayed any military use for the port. Some experts note, however, that the port may still serve China’s broader strategic and other policy objectives.     \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 99 I.  Introduction  China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), also known as Silk Road Initiative, is a global infrastructure development strategy that “connect[s] more than 70 countries on the continents of Asia, Europe and Africa via a series of rail, road and sea infrastructure projects, thus forming a ’new Silk Road’.”1 The goal is to “promote regional connections and economic integration, thereby expanding China’s economic and political influence.”2 Some commentators argue that Pakistan is one of the most important host countries in the BRI, if not the most important.3 China and Pakistan have long shared a cooperative economic and strategic relationship. Pakistan borders China’s Xinjiang Province in the north, which “provides China with a potential corridor through the Karakoram Highway to the seaport at Gwadar in Baluchistan on the Indian Ocean.”4 The Pakistan part of the BRI is called the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), which has been described as the BRI’s flagship project. The plans for establishing an economic corridor between Pakistan and China appears to have preceded the BRI.5 The project was first announced in 2013, when Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of the Pakistani Muslim League-Nawaz (PML-N) party met Chinese Prime Minister Li Keqiang in Beijing. The emphasis was on “connecting China with the Chinese-invested Pakistani port of Gwadar through highway, rail and pipeline infrastructure.”6  CPEC officially launched in April 2015 during an official visit by China’s President Xi Jinping to Pakistan, and the earlier projects were reframed as part of CPEC. Of the high profile projects, the development of the shipping port of Gwadar is considered the most important CPEC project. However, in its earlier phases, CPEC’s emphasis has been on power generation7 and most CPEC funds have “gone to building new coal-fired power plants to help Pakistan overcome its crippling power shortages.”8    CPEC projects include four major areas: the energy sector, transportation infrastructure, the Gwador port, and industrial cooperation through the development and the construction of Special Economic Zones (SEZs).9 Projects are divided temporally into three phases.10 Phase I                                                  1 Amanda Lee, Explainer: Belt and Road Initiative Debt: How Big Is It and What’s Next?, South China Morning Post (July 19, 2020), https://perma.cc/R8EM-RPFD.   2 Id.  3 Grant Farr, Pakistan’s Role in China’s One Belt One Road Initiative, E-International Relations (July 10, 2017), https://perma.cc/39M4-M5D8.  4 Id.  5 Jacob Mardell, The BRI in Pakistan: China’s Flagship Economic Corridor, Mercator Institute for China Studies (MERICS) (May 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/9WN6-48VG. 6 Id.  7 Id.  8 David Sacks, The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor—Hard Reality Greets BRI’s Signature Initiative, Council on Foreign Relations (Mar. 30, 2021), https://perma.cc/N5UC-XVGA.  9 Latest Progress on the CPEC, Embassy of the People's Republic of China in the Islamic Republic of Pakistan (Dec. 29, 2018), https://perma.cc/M5DL-8LZT.  10 Salman Siddiqui, CPEC Moves to Second Phase, Express Tribune (Apr. 12, 2017), https://perma.cc/Q3Y5-A4S5.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 100 (2017-2020) focused on power plants and transport infrastructure in order to “address the major bottlenecks in Pakistan’s economic and social development.”11 According to a report published by the US Institute for Peace, “[t]he first phase [was] essentially an economic stimulus, aimed at helping eliminate Pakistan’s industry-crippling electricity shortages and address its infrastructure inefficiencies while promoting intra-Pakistan and regional connectivity.”12 Phase II (2020-2025) is focused on medium-term projects, including SEZs and social projects “where industrialization, agriculture, science, improving livelihood of people and technology transfer to Pakistan are the key goals.”13 The second phase “aims to leverage the enhanced productive capacity in Pakistan by boosting industries, particularly export-oriented ones, through special economic zones backed with Chinese investments.”14 Phase III (2025-2030) will focus on longer-term projects.  Investments initially were valued at $46 billion, but later increased to $55 billion,15 and estimates as of 2020 were $62 billion.16    Other major projects within CPEC include a “$7 billion upgrade to the railway from Peshawar to Karachi,” two hydroelectric power plants in the disputed Kashmir region, a metro system in Lahore, the establishment of multiple SEZs,17 and “Huawei fiber-optic cables running from China to Pakistan.”18   One report notes that Pakistan’s debt sustainability has become a concern “because of the country’s heavy and increasing debt burden”19 stemming from BRI:   Pakistan’s debt-to-GDP ratio increased from 70 percent in 2017 to 75.3 percent in 2018 and is projected by the IMF to reach a high of 80.5 percent in 2020. Research indicates that countries with rising debt-to-GDP ratios above 50–60 percent are at greater risk of default or debt treatment. Pakistan’s debt is partly the result of borrowing from China. According to an IMF report published in July 2019, Chinese bilateral and commercial loans accounted for 26 percent of Pakistan’s total outstanding debt of $85.5 billion.20                                                  11 Siegfried O.

I think we should put everything on hold for a year so we can get our act together. Perhaps we can stretch CPEC out over another five years or so.”22  This interview saw pushback from the Chinese government and from Pakistan’s military, which tried to repair relations. Since 2019, after projects began to stall, Pakistan’s government has sought to revive CPEC.23 In late December 2020, the Chinese and Pakistan governments held a meeting through a Joint Working Group on International Cooperation on CPEC, during which they proclaimed that both sides “are satisfied with the progress and committed to turn this mega project into a role model for the rest of the world to follow.”24  Some experts believe the “revival” is more “a slimmed-down package” and that ”[g]oing forward, CPEC instead will comprise smaller projects with less potential economic impact.”25 One report notes that in the coming years, CPEC’s agenda will “largely be focused on completing investments that have already been agreed (including around Gwadar port), moving ahead with considerably slimmed-down plans for special economic zones, and identifying small additions that fit the current Pakistani government’s agenda, such as socioeconomic projects.”26                                                     21 Uzair Younus, Pakistan’s Growing Problem with its China Economic Corridors, US Institute of Peace (May 26, 2021), https://perma.cc/3C6Q-VF9Q.  22 Madiha Afzal, At All Costs: How Pakistan and China Control the Narrative on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor 3 (June 2020), https://perma.cc/3MQU-59EW.  23 Pamir Sahill, Israr Alam Mohmand, Pakistan Attempts To Reset Economic Ties With China, Gandhara, RFE/RL (Oct. 9, 2019), https://perma.cc/QCM8-ZYJF.  24 Muhammad Akbar Notezai, CPEC’s Environmental Toll, The Diplomat (Apr. 18, 2018), https://perma.cc/GRB9-LV6C. 25 Sacks, supra note 8.   26 Andrew Small, Center for Asian Law, German Marshall Fund of the United States, Returning to the Shadows: China, Pakistan, and the Fate of CPEC 3 (Sept. 2020), https://perma.cc/7QJE-DCNX.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 102 II.  Legal & Policy Framework   A.  Bilateral Agreements  In November 2003, Chinese President Hu Jintao and Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf signed a “joint declaration on the directions of bilateral cooperation” outlining their commitment to promote and expand bilateral trade and cooperation in investment, economic development, agriculture, technology, and tourism.27   In November 2006, the countries signed the China-Pakistan Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA),28 which was drafted “according to World Trade Organization (WTO) guidelines.”29  Projects under CPEC take the form of myriad number of bilateral agreements and other arrangements, including cooperation agreements, framework agreements, exchanges of notes, MOUs, protocols, financing agreements, commercial contracts, and third party agreements between state parties.30 At CPEC’s official launch in April 2015, both countries signed “51 agreements, memorandums of understanding (MoUs), and financing contracts.”31  However, the details of these agreements and contracts have generally been kept secret; few details have been disclosed to the public.  One case study notes that “[e]very project in the CPEC has different terms and conditions as each is executed by a different Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE) and is independent from other CPEC projects.”32 To illustrate this point, this study noted the varying financing structures used for CPEC projects, which often also involve third parties:  the PowerChina-invested coal-fired power plant is jointly invested with a Qatar-based consortium undertaking the project on a build–operate–transfer (BOT) basis (Pakistan Observer 2019), whereas the coal-fired power plant located in Thar Block II, which has less than a 10 per cent Chinese shareholding, is a public–private partnership between the Sindh provincial government, the China Machinery Engineering Company (CMEC), and Engro (a Pakistani company). The Gwadar International Airport, on the other hand, is financed by a grant (CPEC 2019a).33                                                   27 Joint Declaration Between the People's Republic of China and the Islamic Republic of Pakistan on Directions of Bilateral Cooperation, Nov. 4, 2003, https://perma.cc/RZ9L-44AT.  28 Free Trade Agreement between the Government of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and the Government of the People's Republic of China, Nov. 24, 2006, https://perma.cc/H9W3-2KKB. 29 Shirin Lakhani, The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Regional Effects and Recommendations for Sustainable Development and Trade, 45 Denv.

Long Term Plan   CPEC is also subject to a joint Long Term Plan (LTP). On November 21, 2017, both governments approved a document named the Long Term Plan for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (2017-2030) as a “conceptual framework” to provide “macro guidance for the implementation” of CPEC.34 According to an International Crisis Group (ICG) report, this LTP was “formulated by the centre with little input from local leaders, business or civil society actors. It was not disclosed until December 2017—and then only in broad strokes—after the rollout of some major elements had already begun.”35 It includes chapters on the definition of CPEC and building conditions, visions and goals, guidelines and basic principles, key areas of cooperation, and the investment and financing mechanism and supporting measures.36 This document, however, appears to be an abridged version of a “full 231-page report from 2015” which is not publicly available. According to a USIP report:  In May 2017, excerpts from a draft of the full long-term plan dated from 2015 were leaked by the Pakistani English-language daily Dawn. Planning Minister Ahsan Iqbal described the report as outdated, stating that the full long-term plan is actually a “live document” subject to change. Still, although the extent to which the full and abridged drafts are aspirational is unclear, they, combined with the new projects added to the portfolio, offer a sense of the future direction of CPEC.37  An ICG report quotes a senior journalist investigating CPEC saying, “we still know very little about CPEC. The material that would tell us more is still vigorously concealed.” Another analyst commented that “the launch of the detailed CPEC plan neither adds anything new to our understanding of the project nor helps remove the concerns of critics regarding the overall impact of the project.”38 C.  Institutional Framework  1.  Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC)  The Joint Cooperation Committee (JCC) is the “principal decision-making body” for CPEC.39 It is jointly chaired by Pakistan's Federal Minister for Planning, Development & Special Initiatives and the vice chairman of China's National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC). All the major decisions related to CPEC are discussed and finalized in this committee with the mutual                                                  34 Government of Pakistan Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform, Long Term Plan for China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (2017-2030) 28 (2017), https://perma.cc/7QZM-7LT5. 35 International Crisis Group (ICG), China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Opportunities and Risks, Report No. 297, ii (Jun. 2018), https://perma.cc/4MV5-8R32.  36 Government of Pakistan Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform, supra note 34, at iii. 37  Arif Rafiq, The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Barriers and Impact, US Institute of Peace (2017), https://perma.cc/4UFZ-EN5A (citing Khurram Husain, Exclusive: CPEC Master Plan Revealed, Dawn.com (Jun. 21, 2017), https://perma.cc/Z6BS-RLSE). 38 ICG, supra note 35, at 10.  39 Institutional Framework of CPEC, Obortunity Consulting, https://perma.cc/WR9D-F7NE.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 104 collaboration of Pakistan and China. The JCC is further divided into a five-level hierarchy of Joint Working Groups (JWGs) which cover SEZs, the Gwadar port, planning, energy projects, and transport infrastructure.40 These working groups “convene in between the JCC meetings and make recommendations to the full committee.”41  2.  CPEC Authority   On Oct 8, 2019, the President of Pakistan promulgated the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority Ordinance, which established the CPEC Authority.42 The Authority was established to better coordinate and ensure the timely completion of long delayed CPEC projects.43 The ordinance was extended for 120 days, but lapsed on May 31, 2020. On June 4, 2021, a law to replace the ordinance received presidential assent.44 Section 4 sets out the powers and functions of the Authority, which “shall be responsible for planning, facilitating, coordinating, enforcing, monitoring and evaluating the smooth implementation of all activities related to” CPEC.45 The law provides the Authority shall do so in accordance with an MOU between China’s NDRC and Pakistan’s Ministry for Planning, Development & Special Initiatives on the “Outline of the Long Term Plan on CPEC” signed on November 8, 2014, as well as with decisions taken at meetings of the JCC.46   The Authority is headed by a chairperson and also includes an executive director operations, an executive director research, and six other members.47 The act gives the CPEC Authority the power to organize meetings of the JCC and the joint working groups and to ensure “inter-provincial and inter-ministerial coordination” on CPEC related activities.48 The Authority reports directly to the Prime Minister. A Carnegie Endowment for International Peace report notes that the JCC will still be co-chaired by the Minister for Planning, Development & Special Initiatives on the Pakistani side, but according to section 4(4)(ii), the CPEC Authority may “interface with” NDRC “after due deliberations and consultations with relevant ministries, departments, and other existing fora constituted by the government.”49 Concerns have been raised that the Authority is being headed by a retired military general, which could lead to a shift of control over CPEC projects away from                                                  40 Id.  41 Katharine Adeney, Filippo Boni, How China and Pakistan Negotiate 5, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (May 24, 2021), https://perma.cc/6D8G-WXJ5. 42 China Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority Ordinance, 2019, Pakistan Gazette (Oct. 8, 2019), https://perma.cc/AT7A-Q5LU.  43 ‘CPEC Authority’ Being Set Up For Timely Completion of Projects: PM, Dawn.com (Aug. 20, 2019), https://perma.cc/Z2X4-XG34.  44 China Pakistan Economic Corridor Authority Act, 2020, Pakistan Gazette (June 10, 2021), https://perma.cc/79SS-ZH6W.    45 Id. § 4(1).  46 Id. 47 Id. § 5(1). 48 Id. § 4(3)(iii)-(iv). 49 Adeney & Boni, supra note 41, at 22 (quoting id. § 4(4)(ii)).  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 105 civilian government towards the military.50 The creation of the Authority has also raised concerns over further centralization of CPEC decision-making and reduced provincial influence.51  According to the same Carnegie Endowment report, this centralization has apparently pleased the Chinese government, “but Beijing has still sought to increase ’effective oversight and monitoring’ by proposing a new Pakistan-China joint parliamentary committee on the CPEC. This body will not replace the JCC but reportedly will be responsible for ’day-to-day monitoring of [the] CPEC.’”52  III.  Major CPEC Projects    This part will highlight certain CPEC projects and debt-related issues that have engendered discussion in policy and scholarly circles regarding Pakistan’s debt sustainability in relation to the BRI.  The exact financial structures and terms of various project arrangements are unclear, and information is dependent mostly on secondary sources. Generally, projects under CPEC are financed with a “mix of grants, long-term government concessional loans, zero interest loans and simple partnership or investment mode.”53 These four types of “financing instruments” under CPEC can be summarized as follows:   The first type is called “Investment” where the Chinese firms that are undertaking the infrastructure projects borrow commercial loans with an interest rate between 4-5% The second category is called “Concessional Loans” which are given to the Government of Pakistan at an interest rate of 2-2.5% with a maturity period of 25-30 years. The third category is called “Interest-free loans” which constitute a small proportion of the overall financing and have zero interest payments. The last category is “Grants” which are aimed at improving state capacity.54  A.  Controversy Surrounding Debt Terms and Conditions of Projects  1.  CPEC Infrastructure Projects  CPEC infrastructure projects are being developed mostly through low-interest government concessional loans.55 According to one paper, “[a]pproximately $11 billion worth of infrastructure projects being developed by the Pakistani government will be financed by concessionary loans,                                                  50 Mifrah Haq, Pakistan Army Set to Gain Sweeping Belt and Road Authority, Nikkei Asia (Nov. 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/5MF4-AJSB.  51 Adeney & Boni, supra note 41, at 22. 52 Id. at 23.  53 FAQs, CPEC, https://perma.cc/3L6S-LNQD.  54 Muhammad Khudadad Chattha, Financing Structure of CPEC, CPEC Portal (Oct. 3, 2019), https://perma.cc/L77Y-7KQ2.  55 Naveed Butt, Economic Corridor: China to Extend Assistance at 1.6 Percent Interest Rate, Business Recorder (Sept. 3, 2015), https://perma.cc/9UTL-MKF6.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 106 with composite interest rates of 1.6%. Concessionary loans will be dispersed by the Exim Bank of China, China Development Bank and Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.”56 China’s Exim Bank’s 1.6% low interest concessional loan is covering part of the costs of the upgrading and reconstruction of certain sections of the Karakoram Highway.57 The $1.6 billion Orange Line of the Lahore Metro is being financed at an interest rate of 2.4%, although China reportedly wanted over 3%.58 The $44 million China-Pakistan fiber optic project is at a concessional interest rate of 2%.59   There have been reports of disagreement between the governments of Pakistan and China over the terms of a $6 billion loan and the financial viability for Karachi–Peshawar Railway Line, 60 which includes upgrading a 1,872 km rail line from the capital of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, Peshawar, to the main port city of Karachi.61 More recently, the Express Tribune newspaper reported that due to the “weakening financial position” of Pakistan, the Chinese government during negotiations proposed requiring “additional guarantees” and a “mix of commercial and concessional loans against Islamabad’s desire to secure the cheapest lending.”62 The Chinese Foreign Ministry, on the other hand, denied that it had sought the additional guarantees on a CPEC loan guarantee and said that “[t]hese reports are simply baseless.”63  Some loans from the Chinese government are interest-free. The Eastbay Expressway was financed by such an interest-free loan.64 Also, Pakistan's Gwadar Port and Gwadar airport are being funded by a “grant-based investment,” which “means the government of Pakistan does not have to pay back the investment amount for the development” of the projects. The financing of the airport was converted from a $230 million dollar loan into a grant.65  These projects are often highlighted by the Pakistani and Chinese governments to dispute the narrative that Pakistan is taking “massive loans” for CPEC and “claims that China wants to                                                  56 Jawad Syed, China’s Belt and Road Initiative: A Pakistani Perspective, in China’s Belt and Road Initiative in a Global Context 25 (Jawad Syed & Yung-Hsiang Ying eds., 2019), https://perma.cc/ST5W-P4QP (available on SpringerLink subscription database). 57 Karakoram Highway, Belt and Road Initiative, https://perma.cc/N9RP-MDRF.  58 Shahbaz Rana, Concessionary Loan from China: After Metro Bus, Lahore Could See Metro Train, Express Tribune, (May 5, 2015), https://perma.cc/LMV7-VLCC.  59 Syed, supra note 56, at 25.  60 Adnan Aamir, China and Pakistan Fall Out Over Belt and Road Frameworks, Nikkei Asia (Jan. 19, 2021), https://perma.cc/P7U8-FWTB.  61 Drazen Jorgic, Fearing Debt Trap, Pakistan Rethinks Chinese 'Silk Road' Projects, Reuters (Sept. 30, 2018), https://perma.cc/JVN7-NPWT.  62 Shahbaz Rana, China Seeks Additional Guarantees for $6b New Loan, Express Tribune (Dec. 23, 2020), https://perma.cc/2X9A-7S3Z.  63 Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Zhao Lijian's Regular Press Conference on December 28, 2020, Embassy of the People’s Republic of China in the United States of America, https://perma.cc/V858-BZCB.  64 Adeney & Boni, supra note 41, at 10.  65 China Converts $230m Loan for Gwadar Airport into Grant, The News International (Sept. 23, 2015), https://perma.cc/84Q3-4ZDK.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 107 colonise Pakistan through CPEC.”66 In one response to criticism, Pakistan’s foreign office spokeswoman, Aisha Farooqui, has said CPEC was a “transformational project for Pakistan” and “[t]o claim that CPEC is always in the form of loans and other forms of financing often non-concessional with sovereign guarantees is not based on facts.”67  2.  CPEC Energy Projects   The majority of CPEC investments in the first phase went to energy and power projects, mainly coal power plants.68 Currently, nine energy and power projects have been completed out of 22 that are planned under CPEC;69 “a total estimated cost of the projects is at least $20.9 billion.”70  Experts have argued that CPEC’s energy projects are creating debt distress problems for Pakistan and are adding to the country’s sovereign debt burden. According to one report, most if not all of the “energy-related projects are structured as public private partnerships (P3s).”71 Chinese state-owned power generation companies (also called independent power producers (IPPs)) and other partners build power plants financed mostly through loans from Chinese state-owned financial institutions and banks. One paper describes them as a “private consortia” that are “Joint Chinese–Pakistani firms” to which the Exim Bank of China will “provide investments at 5–6% interest rates.”72 The CPEC power projects also sometimes involve equity investments “equivalent to 15–30 percent of the total project cost.”73 This capital investment is typically provided by IPPs and their partners. For example, “China Three Gorges Corporation provided 93 percent [$316.2 million] of the equity financing for the Karot Hydropower Station.”74  The IPPs supply power to the Government of Pakistan (through the National Electric Power Regulatory Authority (NEPRA)) through power purchasing agreements. The Pakistani government is “contractually obliged to purchase electricity from those firms at pre-negotiated rates.”75 The repayments of the Chinese loans are included within these electricity tariffs. The government of Pakistan also guarantees the obligations of NEPRA to power producers, and “[t]his sovereign guarantee has made investing in the development of power plants in Pakistan                                                  66 Pakistan Becomes Largest Recipient of Chinese Soft Loans, The News International (Jan. 3, 2018), https://perma.cc/3A5W-DCU4.  67 Pakistan Defends Chinese Investment after U.S. Official's Criticism, Reuters (Jan. 30, 2020), https://perma.cc/6NUE-ZKDH.  68 CPEC’s Power Projects Did Not Incur Debt Burden on Pakistan: China, Express Tribune (Feb. 26, 2021), https://perma.cc/8K8B-NWE2.  69 Id.; CPEC-Energy Priority Projects, CPEC, https://perma.cc/G5FS-6AB5.  70 Downs, supra note 19, at 14. 71 Lakhani, supra note 29, at 419.  72 Syed, supra note 56, at 26.  73 Downs, supra note 19, at 35  74 Id.  75 Syed, supra note 56, at 26. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 108 more attractive to Chinese firms and their partners.”76 However, the government is obligated to “honor the sovereign guarantees it issues to back the development of CPEC power projects”77 and this puts the government in a risky debt situation:  Some of these sovereign guarantees support the payment obligations [for purchases] of power [by] the purchaser, the [Central Power Purchasing Authority (CPPA)], to the power producers. . . . [I]f consumers do not pay the distribution companies in full, the distribution companies will not have enough money to pay the CPPA, which will not have enough money to pay the power producers. Under the sovereign guarantee, in the event of a default of payments by the CPPA leading to the termination of the power purchase agreement between the power producer and the CPPA, the power producer can exercise a put option to sell its power plant and recover its investment and return on investment from the government of Pakistan.78  Also, the current government has said that the previous PML-N government “entered into guaranteed power purchase agreements with Chinese companies on what are now perceived as onerous terms, including fixed and high power purchase rates.”79 As one report indicates:  Pakistan is obliged to pay $5.9 billion to the power companies for take-or-pay capacity payments alone over the next four years by 2025. Those will entail more pay than take at current power usage rates. The money is owed despite the fact many of the plants are not actually producing power due to overcapacity and the failure of Pakistani power authorities to develop the national grid and related delivery systems to fully meet grassroots demand. The contracts and their now perceived as onerous conditionalities were made at a time Pakistan faced acute power shortages.80    One report notes that “[a] Pakistani government committee concluded that Chinese contractors were overcharging Islamabad by $3 billion on two CPEC power plants, and reports emerged that Chinese investors were guaranteed large annual returns on their investments.”81 Another report indicates that “China can expect to reap an estimated 27% return on investment from most CPEC projects.”82 Experts are also concerned that “Pakistan could be in serious financial trouble due to the outflow of loans along with interests payments (of Chinese companies to Chinese development Banks) and profit remittances to Chinese companies.”83 A similar assessment is                                                  76 Downs, supra note 19, at 57.  77 Id. at 37.  78 Id.  79 FM Shakil, Chinese Power Loans Fueling a Debt Trap in Pakistan, Asia Times (Feb. 23, 2021), https://perma.cc/4FLT-8XJZ.  80 FM Shakil, Pakistan Begs China for Power Debt Forgiveness, Asia Times (May 30, 2021), https://perma.cc/JU9T-UK5A. 81 Sacks, supra note 8.   82 Lakhani, supra note 29, at 420. 83 Siegfried O. Wolf, Why The Term ‘Debt Trap’ of BRI Projects is a Dangerous Misnomer, SADF Comment, 3 (Dec. 19, 2019), https://perma.cc/B4PC-VKYJ.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 109 shared by an ICG report on overly generous terms to Chinese investors, unreformed power infrastructure, and its impact on Pakistan’s balance of payment crisis:   These assessments reflect that in its bid to attract investment, Pakistan offers overly generous terms to foreign (including Chinese) investors. These will be unaffordable if the increased power generation does not yield the expected economic growth. If, and when, Islamabad seeks another IMF bailout, the IMF will likely demand greater transparency in CPEC energy and other projects’ financing, so as to assess the impact of expensive Chinese loans on Pakistan’s balance of payment crisis. The new plants are in any case inadequate since an aging and inefficient power infrastructure will remain unreformed. Domestic industries and consumers will also continue to pay more, because of a tariff policy that is overly generous to foreign investors and reflects rising expenditure on security for CPEC projects and personnel.84 Additional costs for CPEC projects also stem from project insurance for energy and infrastructure projects. Sinosure, China’s state-owned China Export and Credit Insurance Corporation, is China’s “only official export guarantee agency,”85 and it charges a percentage fee on loans granted to Chinese companies. Sinosure has a “mandate to promote Chinese equipment exports and overseas investment through the provision of insurance against nonpayment and economic losses due to risks including war, expropriation, and breach of contract.”86 According to a leading expert:   China requires Chinese financial institutions and state-owned enterprises to obtain insurance from Sinosure before lending and making investments overseas. . . . Sinosure has underwritten 11 power sector projects in Pakistan with an insured amount of $14.92 billion. NEPRA has allowed a Sinosure fee of up to 7 percent of the total debt servicing to be included in the project cost used to calculate the tariffs for all CPEC power generation projects.87   Another paper notes a number of issues involving insurance arrangements for these projects:  First of all, Sinosure insurance coverage is mandatory for all Chinese loans and investments; it is required for anyone outside China who wants access to this type of capital. This is not uncommon since insurance for international development measures can be seen as standard procedure. But Sinosure is the only insurance provider accepted by Chinese lenders, and consequently is holds the monopoly over China’s development project insurances in both the BRI and CPEC. Sinosure’s monopoly not only undermines the free market choice in this sector; the company also charges higher fees than its international competitors which does not conform with international norms and practices.88                                                   84 ICG, supra note 35, at 11.  85 Id. at 27.  86 Id. 87 Downs, supra note 19, at 27 (citations omitted). 88 Wolf, supra note 83, at 3 (citations omitted). \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 110 Pakistan is seeking to reschedule and renegotiate CPEC loans that have resulted in its oversupply of power plants.89 The government is trying to “decelerate agreed plans to build even more power plants that would add to the overcapacity problem,” cut interest rates on current power sector related loans, and seek a 10-year extension on the debt repayment period.90  It recently has been reported that CPEC power projects are being hit with a circular debt problem, “and the government has not been able to clear Rs188 billion (approximately US$1.179 billion) due payments in breach of a bilateral energy framework agreement.”91 According to the report, “circular debt, which was Rs1.15 trillion in June 2018, has swelled to Rs2.6 trillion” (approximately US$16.3 billion) and the “government has now made a three-pronged strategy to reduce this debt to June 2018 level in the next two years.”92 The Government also “plans to negotiate with China to restructure $3 billion IPPs repayments for 10 to 12 years.”93 Another news report observes:  Pakistan’s debt problems are escalating as liabilities due on China-funded energy projects established under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) surpass $31 billion and Beijing declines to restructure $3 billion in liabilities coming due that Islamabad possibly won’t pay. The debt load, owed largely for the building of independent power producers (IPPs) on take-or-pay power generation contracts, is substantially more than the $19 billion in total invested in the plants, according to reports and industry analysts. Pakistan is obliged to pay $5.9 billion to the power companies for take-or-pay capacity payments alone over the next four years by 2025. Those will entail more pay than take at current power usage rates.94  Reportedly, under a CPEC Energy Framework Agreement from November 2014, the Pakistan government was supposed to establish a revolving fund “equal to 22% of monthly invoice” for power costs, backed by the sovereign guarantees provided by the Ministry of Finance. The purpose of the fund was to ensure that if the power purchaser “fails to make payments, the dues of the Chinese firms will be settled against this account to ensure uninterrupted payments to Chinese sponsors of energy projects.”95 The government of Pakistan “will assume the liability and pay the Chinese power producers.”96 This was a means for the Pakistani government “to attract Chinese investment in coal power projects”; the government “offered this incentive to CPEC coal power plants in April 2015 and subsequently extended it to all CPEC power projects                                                  89 Faseeh Mangi, Pakistan to Seek Debt Relief From China Belt and Road Loan, Bloomberg (Feb. 9, 20121), https://perma.cc/DK4Y-7XGP.  90 Shakil, supra note 79.  91 Shahbaz Rana, Circular Debt also Hits CPEC Projects, Express Tribune (May 9, 2021), https://perma.cc/J7YF-2GDX.  92 Id. 93 Id. 94 Shakil, supra note 80. 95 Rana, supra note 91.  96 Downs, supra note 19, at 23. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 111 in February 2016 as a result of concerns by Chinese investors about the risk of delayed payments.”97   B.  Level of Involvement of Local Companies/Workforce   Almost all major CPEC projects are being “implemented by Chinese companies and state-owned enterprises,” and there has been considerable criticism over the lack of competitive bidding and fair procurement practices.98 One World Bank working paper describes the deficiencies and lack of transparency in the procurement process:  According to the interviews, procurement of high-value CPEC projects financed through the EXIM Bank of China is restricted to Chinese contractors. The Chinese CPEC authorities nominate three Chinese firms for bidding purposes. Procuring entities then issue the bidding documents to the three nominated Chinese contractors, seeking bids for the contract. Contracts make allowance for domestic contractors to collaborate with Chinese counterparts via joint ventures. The processes used during the initial selection of the three Chinese contractors were not known, impeding an assessment of the extent to which possibilities for collusive practices are controlled for in the process of selecting the winning contractor. The feasibility of domestic construction firms being able to obtain sub-contracting work is left to the Chinese contractors, and the extent to which the government of Pakistan is willing and able to pursue “local content” objectives when negotiating BRI projects. The CPEC agreement between Pakistan and China allows for sub-contracting up to a maximum of 30% of the contract value, subject to the procuring entity’s agreement. The perception of interviewees is that Chinese contractors use their own labor and that BRI procurement contracts are not very helpful in providing employment opportunities within the country. This is consistent with other assessments that even if local capacity exists, Chinese labor and equipment are generally used for BRI projects.99  A number of Senate standing committees and the Auditor General of Pakistan (AGP) have noted a number of “irregularities” in the procurement processes in the award for highways and motorways projects,100 including a lucrative contract for the Multan-Sukkur Motorway project granted by the National Highway Authority (NHA) to a Chinese state-owned corporation, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC). They found that the project was awarded to the Chinese company on an “alternate bid” in violation of procurement regulations, and that tax exemptions and concessions were granted that were not in the original bidding documents.101 Though initially admitting irregularities, the NHA later claimed that project was “processed and                                                  97 Id. 98 Murad Ali, Monitoring and Evaluation in South-South Cooperation: The Case of CPEC in Pakistan, Discussion Paper, No. 1/2018, Deutsches Institut für Entwicklungspolitik 30 (2018), https://perma.cc/CYM6-KWEZ.  99 Tania Ghossein, Bernard Hoekman & Anirudh Shingal, Public Procurement in the Belt and Road Initiative, MTI Discussion Paper No. 10, 7 (Dec. 2018), https://perma.cc/EY95-4JVF.  100 CPEC’s transparency: NHA Admits Irregularities in Award of $2.9b contract to Chinese Firm, Express Tribuine, (Feb. 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/M6NV-2BKQ; Over Rs400bn Irregularities Found in Road Projects, Dawn.com (Oct. 17, 2017), https://perma.cc/7KN4-NDGW.  101 Id.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 112 awarded as per the prevalent rules and regulations with total transparency and there is no question of violation of any rule in this regard.”102  No agreements or conditions could be found on “local content” rules for Pakistani companies or workforce for CPEC-related projects. Statistics vary, but reports indicate that in 2017, 30,000 jobs103 were generated for Pakistanis; in 2018, 70,000 such jobs were created;104 and in 2019, 75,000 were added.105 Some reports state CPEC is “expected to add over 700,000 jobs to the Pakistani labor market” from 2015 to 2030,106 while others report estimates of 2.3 million jobs by 2030.107   However, according to one working paper,   [t]he employment generated under early harvest projects of CPEC required precise definite skills and experiences, which was unfortunately lacking in the prevailing domestic workers. Consequently, Chinese companies became more inclined towards foreign workers. In this regard, the proportion of unskilled domestic labors hired in these projects were far more than the skilled/technical labors of Pakistan.108   Therefore, a large portion of generated employment was “comprised of raw labourers, leaving space for the Chinese skilled workers to seize the employment opportunities in early harvest projects of CPEC.”109 Chinese companies “had to opt for foreign workers and the proportion of unskilled domestic labourers hired in these projects were more than the skilled and technical labourers of Pakistan. For example, an energy plant under CPEC hired almost 3,000 skilled labourers, of which 77[%] were of Chinese origin.”110   The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) is “likely to create about 575,000 direct and over 1 million indirect jobs in four special economic zones (SEZs) to be set up in Pakistan's Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KP), Punjab, Sindh and Balochistan provinces,” according to a Pakistani                                                  102 NHA Denies ‘Irregularities’ in Awarding Multan-Sukkur Motorway Contract, The News (Mar. 2, 2018), https://perma.cc/2CVA-6CTE.  103 'CPEC Provides Jobs to 30,000 Pakistanis,' Express Tribune (Jun. 7, 2017), https://perma.cc/WT2X-YRGX.  104 70,000 Employed under CPEC, 0.7m to Get More Jobs, The News International (Apr. 4, 2018), https://perma.cc/FH8V-N73S.  105 CPEC to Create 700,000 Direct Jobs for Pakistanis by 2030, The News International (Jan. 8, 2019), https://perma.cc/LH4G-5SNT.  106 Lakhani, supra note 29, at 418.  107 CPEC to Generate 2.3 Million Jobs by 2030, The News International (Aug. 10, 2020), https://perma.cc/CL6X-UHQF.  108 Shahid Rashid, Muhammad Muzammil Zia & Shujaa Waqar, Employment Outlook of CPEC: A Meta Analysis 2 (2018), https://perma.cc/Q5YQ-YCSG.  109 Govt to Impart Skill Training to Labourers for CPEC Projects, Pakistan Today (Mar. 7, 2019), https://perma.cc/YGU9-CQPX.  110 Id.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 113 government official in the Ministry of Planning, Development and Reform.111 But critics say the CPEC has “been sold to the Pakistani people as a way to ensure local development, job creation, and the inclusion of all provinces. The reality is that the government has centralized power, and there is little evidence to date of new skilled jobs being created.”112   As of 2020, Chinese companies working in Pakistan were “facing [an] acute shortage of skilled labor as [a] majority of local workers falls under [the] unskilled category.” China promised to help Pakistan establish vocational institutes in Pakistan to help meet demand for a skilled workforce.113   C.  Military or Strategic Purpose of Projects   Gwador port is a deep-sea commercial and multipurpose port located in the province of Baluchistan at the Arabian sea, situated “at the mouth of the Persian Gulf, just outside the Straits of Hormuz, near the key shipping routes in and out of the Persian Gulf.”114 It is being developed as an “economic hub” for other CPEC projects in the area, including the Gwadar Eastbay Expressway (connecting Gwadar Port to Mehran Coastal Highway), a new international airport, an SEZ, and other projects. The port of Gwadar was a “Pakistani-initiated proposal in the early 2000s that was only later rebranded as a BRI project after 2013”; “[a]ll Pakistani governments over the past twenty years, both military- and civilian-led, have encouraged China’s involvement in Gwadar, while Beijing in turn sees the port as a strategic access point to the Indian Ocean.”115 Since February 2013, construction and operations/management of the Port have been conducted by a state-run Chinese enterprise– China Overseas Port Holding Company (COPHC) through a leasing agreement “on a build-operate and transfer model spread over 40 years.” Per this agreement, which has been criticized for being one sided (“the impression in Pakistan is that benefits will accrue mainly to the Chinese”), 91% of the revenue and port generated profits will go to COPHC and 9% to the Gwadar Port Authority.116 Also, 85 percent of the revenue generated by the Gwadar free zone will also go to China.117  One report notes that the Chinese government’s “likely hopes [are] that CPEC would open up a direct route between China and the Indian Ocean, that a prosperous Pakistan would no                                                  111 CPEC Special Economic Zones to Create 575,000 Direct Jobs in Pakistan, Xinhua (June 23, 2021), https://perma.cc/U5FY-3EKZ.  112 Adeney & Boni, supra note 41, at 22.  113 Pakistan to Set Up Vocational Training Institutes with China’s Support, Daily Times (Sept. 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/YW27-LGFQ. 114 Gwadar Port, Gwadar Port Authority, https://perma.cc/5JCJ-DTZM.  115 Adeney & Boni, supra note 41, at 2.  116 Iftikhar A.

It is not currently not being used for a PLA military base, however. According to a Carnegie report,   Islamabad’s initial offer allegedly included developing a military base at Gwadar, or as then defense minister Chaudhary Ahmed Mukhtar announced, “We have asked our Chinese brothers to please build a naval base at Gwadar.” China, however, denied these claims. As the New York Times put it, Mukhtar’s statement was seen by some “as a pointed, if graceless, effort to send a message to the United States that Pakistan had other options should its foundering relationship with Washington prove beyond repair” after bin Laden was killed on Pakistani soil. Since then, both China and Pakistan have downplayed the military development of Gwadar.   According to a China Maritime Studies Institute (CMSI) case study, the port still serves to further “broader PRC foreign and domestic policy objectives.” The study notes that “[f]oremost among PRC objectives for Gwadar are (1) to enable direct transport between China and the Indian Ocean, and (2) to anchor an effort to stabilize western China by shoring up insecurity on its periphery.”  The study finds that “China’s interest in Gwadar—and in Pakistan’s economic development in general—thus does not depend primarily on commercial returns or military utilization. Instead, the Gwadar project is a mode of strategic investment in China’s external and internal security.”119  IV. Scholarly Criticisms; Assessment of Projects’ Impact    A. CPEC as “Game-Changer” or “Debt Trap”  Some observers maintain that “China is intentionally attempting to saddle countries with unsustainable levels of debt in order to gain control of strategic infrastructure or political influence when borrowing countries can’t repay their loans.”120 This is described as the “debt trap” diplomacy narrative. One expert notes, however, that   the term ”debt trap” is not suitable to describe the whole range of monetary risks and current as well as upcoming financial burdens in the context of the CPEC. Not being in a “debt trap” situation as currently—and narrowly—defined does not mean that Pakistan is able to avoid an unpleasant financial situation.121   A report by Center of Energy Policy notes that:                                                   118 Sacks, supra note 8.    119 Isaac Kardon, China’s Geopolitical Gambit in Gwadar, Wilson Center’s Asia Dispatches (Oct. 20, 2020), https://perma.cc/LZ8Y-8GVR.  120 Downs, supra note 19, at 34. 121 Wolf, supra note 83, at 4. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 115 there is a risk that the CPEC power projects will add to Pakistan’s sovereign debt burden, but multiple factors indicate that any increase in sovereign debt from these projects is unlikely to be the result of a deliberate strategy on the part of China. Although the debt financing arrangements for CPEC power sector projects primarily involve loans from Chinese banks to project companies wholly or partly owned by Chinese firms, these projects may increase Pakistan’s debt because of sovereign guarantees issued by Islamabad to support CPEC power projects and the liquidity crisis in Pakistan’s power sector known as circular debt. That said, several aspects of the China-Pakistan relationship and the large stake that China’s government and companies have in the success of CPEC indicate that Chinese interests are better served by sustainable CPEC projects than unsustainable ones.122  Other observers, including the current Pakistani government, describe the “debt trap” narrative as a false, misleading, or simplistic assessment. Advocates of CPEC, including the Pakistani government, have described it as an economic “game changer” and a “win-win project of China-Pakistan economic cooperation.”123 Both governments describe characterizations of CPEC as a “debt trap” as “devoid of facts” and hold that not enough attention is drawn to the mutual economic benefits to both countries and the region.124 One paper highlights some of these economic and trade benefits to Pakistan:  The benefits that Pakistan is likely to gain from CPEC include upgrading of the road and deep-water port infrastructure, an enhanced capacity for energy production and a boost in manufacturing activity due to the SEZs. Moreover, there are opportunities for technology transfer in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan through foreign direct investment (FDI) or through collaborative arrangements. Also, the initiative provides an opportunity to position Pakistan as a major transit point connecting the Eurasian region with South Asia and Southeast Asia, which is much needed for the country’s economic growth. In 2017, the Pakistan Credit Rating Agency (PACRA) suggested that the establishment of energy projects under CPEC would help overcome shortages and play a positive role in achieving the required economic growth of 7% in the next two to three years.125  Prime Minister Imran Khan has stated that CPEC “’is really helping’ the country,” has highlighted that loans are only a small part of the total CPEC portfolio, and has argued that as a result of the project Pakistan has attracted more foreign investment and helped Pakistan with technology/skill transfer.126 Another article summarizes the government’s point of view that CPEC loans for infrastructure are concessional loans with low interest rates and that “energy-related projects in the CPEC can prove to be very helpful for “overcoming the energy shortages”                                                  122 Downs, supra note 19, at 8. 123 CPEC a Game Changer Project Not Only for Pakistan, But Also for Entire Region: Shibli, Radio Pakistan (Nov. 25, 2020), https://perma.cc/BC8V-LNSZ.  124 Id.; Dr. Moonis Ahmar, CPEC as a Game Changer?, Express Tribune (Nov. 29, 2019), https://perma.cc/77EY-AERN.   125 Syed, supra note 56, at 22 (citations omitted).  126 CPEC is Not Debt-Trap But Helping Pakistan, Says PM, Gulf Today (Jan. 24, 2020), https://perma.cc/422P-ZC8K.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 116 and increasing the GDP growth rate.127  One paper notes that the Chinese embassy in Islamabad emphasizes that “the 42% of foreign-debt of Pakistan is from multilateral financial institutions such as the IMF and World Bank. 18% of the debt is from the Paris Club. Chinese preferential loans only account for 10% of [Pakistan’s] whole foreign debt and offer a much lower rate in the form of concessional loans rather than commercial bank loans.”128  A 2020 Chatham House paper observes that BRI cannot simply be narrowly reduced to geo-strategic terms, as   [Chinese] leaders and central agencies attempt to shape the overall direction of the BRI through (often vague) policy statements and broad commitments to particular countries or regions, but the institutional fragmentation of China’s development financing regime and its recipient-driven nature means that projects emerge in a piecemeal, non-strategic and bilateral manner.129   The paper also states that “[o]verall guidance from the government exists, but operates loosely, steering the system towards broad objectives rather than specifying detailed outcomes,”130 and “[e]ven where top leaders support specific projects, typically at foreign counterparts’ request, policy banks and SOEs may refuse or stall their participation if they cannot extract sufficient profit.”131 The paper gives the example of coal-fired plants proposed under the CPEC that “have been scrapped because SOEs could not secure their desired margins.”132  The paper goes on the conclude that “rather than debt-trap diplomacy, bumps on the Belt and Road are typically caused by the intersection between powerful interests and associated governance shortcomings on the Chinese and recipient sides.”133 Chinese SOEs’ “desperate need for contracts, and weak governance of development financing, coupled with poor planning or venal interests in recipient countries, are generating badly conceived projects that replicate China’s surplus capacity crisis.”134 The 2020 paper also notes that fewer than a third of CPEC projects had been completed, observing that “[a]t Gwadar, for example, the port is reportedly barely used; construction of an airport (which would have been Pakistan’s largest) has still not begun after six years of delays; and an industrial park sits empty.”135                                                   127 Zahid Khan et al., Debunking Criticism on the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, 53(6) The Chinese Economy, 477, 483 (2020), https://perma.cc/43NB-8ABS (available on Taylor & Francis Online subscription database).   128 Zahid Khan, The China-Pakistan Economic Corridor: Economic Rationale and Key Challenges, 5(2) China Quarterly of Int’l Strategic Stud. 249 (2019), https://perma.cc/9A2M-NXYB.  129 Lee Jones, Shahar Hameiri, Chatam House, Debunking the Myth of ‘Debt-trap Diplomacy’ How Recipient Countries Shape China’s Belt and Road Initiative 8 (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/6FSX-CWHA.  130 Id. at 9.  131 Id. 132 Id. 133 Id. at 11.  134 Id. 135 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 117 One report also notes that China has also established a “track record of waiving or restructuring loans without taking control of assets.”136   A report published by the Center of Asian Law states:   [w]hile CPEC will not be the game-changer for the Pakistani economy that its supporters once hailed, it is not a debt trap either. This picture could change if there is injudicious selection of new projects designed around maintaining the CPEC narrative rather than Pakistan’s economic needs but the two sides have so far been more cautious on debt-financing than has been seen elsewhere on the BRI.137   Another writer says there is scant evidence supporting the criticism that the BRI pushes countries into debt traps, but notes that the BRI can generate debt problems for some countries, as well as “a range of short to medium-term economic problems, . . . such as acute fiscal issues, balance of payments crises, and a dramatic fall in foreign reserves.”138   Another paper draws a similar observation on what it calls misleading and simplistic narratives on CPEC:  CPEC is also an illustration of the fact that assessing the BRI’s future direction will continue to require a close read of the practical developments in the countries concerned, rather than a scan of public pronouncements and a hunt for data to fit a preexisting analytical framework. Discussion of CPEC has consistently been characterized by a major gap between the facts on the ground and how it is described. Even some of the best, and most thoughtful experts continue to use figures that have long lost their connection to reality. The BRI meta-narrative casts a long shadow over whichever specific case is being examined, whether it be lines drawn on maps across Asia, superlative numbers, dual-use ports, debt traps, and other tropes. In the case of Pakistan, some of these framings have been misleading. The “corridor” concept and transportation routes from Xinjiang to Gwadar have been a consistent, distracting focal point from the nature of the investments that have been made. Rumors of large-scale debt distress—which are founded in several other BRI cases—have not been fully borne out by the facts. There continues to be more interest on the part of many outside observers in potential dual-use facilities at a barely functional port than out-and-out military cooperation taking place in plain sight.139                                                      136 Downs, supra note 19, at 35. 137 Small, supra note 26, at 5. 138 Srijan Shukla, Two Phrases Critics of China’s BRI Must Not Use – Debt Trap & Threat to Sovereignty, The Print (May 1, 2019), https://perma.cc/H4FT-GLQJ.  139 Small, supra note 26, at 5. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 118  Hambantota Port (Sri Lanka)  On the discussion of “debt trap” and BRI, the controversy surrounding the deep sea port of Hambontota in Sri Lanka is often mentioned.140 The story as commonly framed is that despite feasibility studies showing that the port was not financially viable, the Sri Lankan government took out loans with onerous terms to construct the port; it was unable to pay off the loans, which pushed the country into default, and the government had no choice but to hand over control of the port to a Chinese firm as collateral.141 However, other experts believe the situation is more complex.142 While the government of Sri Lanka’s previous president, Mahinda Rajapaksa, took out loans from China at commercial interest rates to “build infrastructure in his hometown of Hambantota, including a port,”143 these loans were not a significant portion of the foreign debt servicing payments. Facing a “persistent balance of payment (BOP) crisis,” the government “had to look for various avenues to obtain foreign currency inflows.” Leasing the port “was one of the ways to increase the country’s foreign reserves.”144 In 2017, China Merchants Port Holdings (CMPH) “became the majority shareholder in a joint venture with Sri Lanka Ports Authority that holds a concession to develop and operate the port for 99 years. CMPH paid the Sri Lanka Ports Authority $1.12 billion for the joint venture stake.”145    B.  Impact Assessment of Projects  A number of impact assessments and other policy studies have been done looking at the political/strategic, environmental, economic, and social impact of CPEC projects. For example, the Sustainable Development Policy Institute (SDPI) conducted a preliminary environmental impact assessment of CPEC northern route road construction activities in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa, and found that “the impacts of the road construction activities are different and vary with the process and component and [m]ost of these impacts have a detrimental effect on the environment & public health and require mitigation measures to minimize the damage.”146 Criticisms have also been directed towards the negative impact on the environment and health from coal power plants and the lack of “economic cost benefit analysis and Environmental Impact Analysis (EIA) of the said coal-based projects in Pakistan.”147 Other studies have looked at the negative impact on Pakistan’s biodiversity:                                                  140 Maria Abi-Habib, How China Got Sri Lanka to Cough Up a Port, NY Times (Jun. 25, 2018), https://perma.cc/NH58-Q5X4.  141 Id. 142 Deborah Brautigam, Meg Rithmire, The Chinese ‘Debt Trap’ Is a Myth, The Atlantic (Feb. 6, 2021), https://perma.cc/2YDM-5Y8E.  143 Downs, supra note 19, at 35. 144 Umesh Moramudali, Is Sri Lanka Really a Victim of China’s ‘Debt Trap’?

Sadly, the road route proposed for the CPEC requires forest cutting, as Pakistan already has the lowest sustainability performance score, by having the smallest share of forests in South Asia. Pakistan has already launched different collaborative conservation projects with different donor agencies such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF), mainly aimed at conserving habitats for fauna and flora and developmental skill programs for the locals of the northern area. Biodiversity in the northern mountain has a pivotal role in supporting and sustaining the livelihood of surrounding communities. In this context, China and Pakistan are engaged in identifying different ways to address, minimize, and mitigate harm to biodiversity on a priority basis and maximize the social acceptability and environmental benefits of the CPEC.148  Another study looked at the social impact of investment activities in different parts of the country according to different stakeholders:  According to the Pakistani side, political and safety risks are higher than other risks. We also found that different stakeholders within Pakistan have different attitudes to different risks. Based on the questionnaire results and the four divided regions in accordance with the [regional discourse method], we determined that social risks of the western high mountain region include tribal obstacles and religious extremism. The social risks to the southeast coastal plains include preserving the historical and cultural heritage of the area and international protection of national parks. The social risks in north Kashmir include disputes, extremist threats, religious and cultural differences, and the protection of natural reserves.149  Another study looks at displacement and the impact on the social life patterns of fishing communities of Gwadar port.150  Other studies have also evaluated the lack of due diligence and evaluation of the financial viability of projects. For example, one study stated:   This need and greed [i.e., regional favoritism and patronage in infrastructure projects], and associated political contestation, very often overwhelm rational development planning, generating projects of dubious economic viability with substantial negative political, social and environmental implications. Many developing countries have limited capacity to assess projects’ viability or ensure their appropriate governance, and bureaucratic niceties are often overridden by powerful interests. For example, Pakistani interest groups’ wrangling has repeatedly changed the route and scope of the CPEC, with many additional projects being added on, some of which appear commercially unviable.

Public Support and Political Opposition   Individual parliamentarians have raised concerns about “inequitable distribution of CPEC projects and resources,” increased centralization of CPEC decision making, and lack of transparency over specific CPEC projects. However, according to a 2018 ICG report, “all the major opposition parties have also supported CPEC and been reluctant to discuss it in parliament,” and “[c]ommittee chairs and ranking members have failed to promote open debate or exercise oversight over one of Pakistan’s most ambitious economic and geostrategic undertakings.”152 However, despite near universal political support for CPEC among all major political parties, the opposition has criticized the government for lack of progress on projects. For example,   The slowdown of CPEC in Pakistan has provided an overt opportunity to the opposition parties, especially the Pakistan Muslim League-Nawaz party led by Sharif. Opposition leaders have repeatedly criticized the current government for being responsible for stalled-out projects. The current government is trying hard to overcome the opposition by focusing its attention on the CPEC projects’ revival.153    There is also opposition to CPEC projects from Baloch separatist or nationalist groups, and there have been sporadic terrorist attacks in Gwador and elsewhere in the province of Balochistan and Sindh. Local residents of Gwadar have shown opposition to CPEC over concern with its impact on livelihoods, fear of displacement, and whether they will “reap the fruits of Chinese investment.”154 More recently, in January 2021, Baluchistan government authorities shelved a controversial fencing plan around Gwadar that had drawn local protests and opposition.155 In 2020, government of Sindh province, led by the Pakistan Peoples Party, opposed156 a presidentially-promulgated Pakistan Islands Development Authority (PIDA) Ordinance157 that took direct control of two islands off the coast of the port city of Karachi “to facilitate reclamation and urban planning” and develop the islands into commercial zones.158 Some news reports indicate that Sindhi nationalist politicians also oppose PIDA “because they believe the islands                                                  151 Jones & Hameiri, supra note 129, at 11 (citations omitted).  152 ICG, supra note 35, at 10. 153 Muhammad Akbar Notezai, What Happened to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor?, The Diplomat (Feb. 16, 2021), https://perma.cc/3FHW-KJG5.  154 Michael Kovrig, National Ambitions Meet Local Opposition Along the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, The Diplomat (July 24, 2018), https://perma.cc/GK24-AJD7.   155 Keegan Elmer, China-Pakistan Relations: Security Fence at Gwadar Port Creates New Tensions (Jan. 2, 2021), https://perma.cc/45SN-AWQW.  156 Centre, Sindh at Odds over Islands Ordinance, Express Tribune (Oct. 6, 2020), https://perma.cc/3AM2-7WZV 157 Pakistan Islands Development Authority Ordinance, 2020, https://perma.cc/KX86-84DQ.  158 Adnan Aamir, Pakistan Politicians Fear Losing Strategic Islands to China, Nikkei Asia (Oct. 13, 2020), https://perma.cc/PK3U-2DBE.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 121 could be handed to China as another CPEC component.”159 The ordinance has since lapsed as the federal government has not extended it nor has Parliament passed a law to replace it.160                                                             159 Id. 160 Ordinance for Islands Development Authority has Lapsed, SHC Told, The News (Jan. 16, 2021), https://perma.cc/54HD-CEWL.  \fThe Law Library of Congress 122 Philippines  Gustavo Guerra Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY The Philippines and China signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2018. The MOU provides that the Philippines and China agree to cooperate on a number of areas of common interest, including infrastructure projects. On the same date of signature of the BRI MOU, the Philippines and China signed 28 additional agreements, which include the development of a number of infrastructure projects, such as the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project and the Kaliwa Dam Project. The financing for these projects is being provided by China, through contracts that include nondisclosure and immunity clauses that have been criticized by a number of scholars.    I.  Introduction   Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte visited China on May 13-15, 2017, to participate in the Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation hosted by China, along with 29 other world leaders.1 During his visit, he held bilateral meetings with Chinese President Xi Jinping, during which President Duterte expressed the Philippines’ commitment to pursue stronger ties with China.2    In November 2018, the governments of the Philippines and China signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Cooperation on the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).3 The MOU provides that the Philippines and China agree to cooperate on a number of areas of common interest, including infrastructure, trade, transportation interconnectivity, telecommunication and energy.4 The BRI MOU is effective through 2022 and may be renewed for another four years.5                                                     1 Phl-China Relations, Embassy of the Philippines in Beijing, China, https://perma.cc/TX7J-HPFH.  2 Id. 3 Robert Vergara, Malacañang Releases Copy of PH, China MOU on Belt and Road Initiative, CNN Philippines (Nov. 27, 2018), https://perma.cc/CUB2-KJQ2.  4 Id.

Legal Framework   The 2018 MOU on the BRI provides that it does not create legally binding obligations for the signatory parties, as it is “an expression of their common aspiration to cooperate on the Belt and Road Initiative for their own benefit.”6  It also states that any disputes that may arise from the interpretation or implementation of the MOU should be settled in an amicable manner through diplomatic channels.7 This MOU does not provide specific information on implementing projects derived from it.   Notably, the Philippines and China signed 28 additional agreements on the same date that the BRI MOU was entered into, according to a release from the Embassy of the Philippines in Beijing.8  These agreements cover several topics, including the development of a number of infrastructure projects, such as the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project and the Kaliwa Dam Project.9 These projects were reportedly prioritized and expedited in recent years by the Philippines government with Chinese financing and project involvement, per pertinent agreements discussed in Section III below.10   III.  Major “Flagship” Projects    A.  Kaliwa Dam  The Kaliwa Dam, located in Quezon Province, is about 200 feet high and spreads over approximately 279 acres.11 It is supposed to hold more than 15 billion gallons of water and increase the water supply sent to the Philippine National Capital Region and its neighboring provinces.12 These provinces currently receive their water from another source (the Angat Dam), which has experienced frequent resource shortfalls in the last decade.13   The China Energy Engineering Corporation Limited (or Energy China), a major Chinese state-owned enterprise (SOE), is in charge of the construction of the Kaliwa Dam, with support from the local Metropolitan Waterworks and Sewerage System.14                                                    6 Id.

Chico River Pump Irrigation Project   The Chico River Pump Irrigation Project is designed to provide water to more than 18,600 acres of arable land in certain municipalities of Cagayan Province, and to nearly 2,900 acres in Pinukpuk, in Kalinga Province.15 This project includes the “construction of a pump house, sub-station, transmission line, diversion main canal, lateral canals, appurtenant structures, service/access road, and terminal facilities for Chico River PIP.”16   The China CAMC Engineering Company Limited (affiliated with Sinomach, another major Chinese SOE) is working with the Philippines National Irrigation Authority to build this project.17  C.  Confidentiality Clauses in Both Financing Agreements  Both of these agreements include a confidentiality clause providing that the Philippines, as a borrower, must keep all terms of the accord strictly confidential, unless the Chinese lender agrees to their disclosure to third parties or such action is required by Philippine law or a pertinent order from a court.18  Alvin Camba, a frequently cited researcher who recently published a study on these agreements, has stated that although both contracts were published by the Philippine Department of Finance on March 18, 2019, the agreements were finalized in 2018, and they were released under public pressure for their disclosure.19   The study further indicates that “such clauses effectively prevent civil society actors or foreign lenders from forming strategies to match Chinese lending terms,” and “increase the exclusivity of an investment partnership to those who have forged it, excluding . . . civil society leaders from the process.”20  D.  Dispute Resolution Clauses  Both contracts provide that these agreements and the rights and duties of the parties are to be governed by, and construed under, Chinese law, and disputes deriving them must be subject to                                                  15 Id. 16 Id. 17 Id. 18 Id. at 16, 18.

Similarly, under the 2018 contract on China’s $211 million loan for the Kaliwa Dam project, a dispute between the Philippines and China would be arbitrated by the Hong Kong International Arbitration Center.  These clauses contrast with arbitration practice for World Bank loans. The Washington-based global financial institution uses the International Center for Settlement of Investment Disputes, a multilateral body in which 163 member countries have a stake. While the center has been criticized for favoring investors’ rights over those of states, it is an autonomous institution.22  E.  Clause on Waiver of Immunity Included in the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project Loan Agreement  Clause 8.1 of the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project Loan Agreement provides that the Philippines has agreed to waive any immunity on grounds of sovereignty “for itself or its property” related to any arbitration proceeding derived from disputes pertaining to the loan agreement.23  The RFA article on this agreement cited in Section III.D. above provides the following commentary on this clause:                                                    21 Preferential Buyer’s Credit Loan Agreement on the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project, art. 8.4, supra note 18; Preferential Buyer’s Credit Loan Agreement on the New Centennial Water Source-Kaliwa Dam, art. 8.4, supra note 18.  22 China’s Loan Agreements with Philippines Skewed in Beijing’s Favor: Contracts Show the Philippines Is One of Few Southeast Asian Countries to Make Such Agreements Public, Analysts Say, RFA (June 14, 2021), https://perma.cc/JX9R-6Z65.   23 Preferential Buyer’s Credit Loan Agreement on the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project, art. 8.1, supra note 18. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Philippines The Law Library of Congress 126 The Chico River project has also raised concerns, with critics saying it placed the Philippines’ “patrimonial assets” as collateral. The contract states that the Philippines “irrevocably waives any immunity” on “patrimonial assets and assets dedicated to commercial use.”  Patrimonial assets are properties owned by the Philippines that are not for public use, public service, or the development of national wealth, legal sources say. That means under the Chico River loan contract, the Philippines has no immunity on assets it owns that are used for commercial purposes.  Antonio Carpio, a former senior associate justice at the Philippine Supreme Court, believes Beijing could end up taking over assets such as the gas-rich Reed Bank in the disputed South China Sea, if Manila failed to pay back the loan.  In March 2019, then-Finance Assistant Secretary Antonio Lambino told CNN Philippines that the Reed Bank could not be classified as a patrimonial asset because its exploitation would increase national wealth.  But Carpio told BenarNews that Reed Bank must be considered a commercial use asset because the government would sell gas obtained from it to the market.  There are “many . . . laws authorizing the sale of oil and gas to private parties under Service Contracts. Once covered by a Service Contract, [they] are patrimonial assets, they can now be collateralized and subject to seizure by creditors,” he said.  Other countries that lend do not employ such clauses in their loan agreements. For instance, Japan, also a major investor of infrastructure projects in the Philippines, does not require waivers of immunity, or the use of Japanese law. Japan also doesn’t require waiving rights to patrimonial assets in its general terms and conditions for overseas development loans.24  IV.  Criticism    In May 2021, the Stratbase ADR Institute (ADRi, an independent, international research organization focused on analysis of economic, social, political, and strategic issues influencing the Philippines and the Indo-Pacific region) held a virtual town hall discussion that examined the BRI’s impact on Southeast Asian countries, in particular the Philippines.25    According to a news report on this event, participants criticized the confidentiality and waiver of immunity clauses included in the financing agreements explained in Section III above, for similar reasons described therein.26 In addition, a scholar with ADRi addressing the interest rate of the projects was quoted as follows:                                                   24 RFA, supra note 22.   25 Stratbase ADR Inst., BRI and Corrosive Capital: Mitigating Corruption Risks in the Philippines (May 14, 2021), https://perma.cc/5HSJ-6GQC.    26 Bernie Cahiles-Magkilat, Think Tanks, Groups Warn vs China’s Global Infrastructure Build-Up, Manila Bull. (May 25, 2021), https://perma.cc/TY27-4VEU.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Philippines The Law Library of Congress 127 At an interest rate of 2%, the Chico River Pump Irrigation Project and the Kaliwa Dam project contracts to China were disadvantageous to the Philippines.  Compared to less than 0.2 percent. Remember the two projects, Chico river, Kaliwa Dam, were at an interest rate of 2 percent per annum, whereas we could have gotten it at 0.2% from . . . South Korea and Japan.27  On this matter, Alvin Camba stated the following:  Keeping interest rates low was not important to the Philippine government. Both the Kaliwa Dam project and the CRPIP had interest rates of 2 percent, which are slightly higher than those that must be paid to Japanese lenders but far lower than what commercial bank lenders have demanded from the Philippines. As a Philippine Department of Defense interviewee pointed out, “The payment scheme for both Chinese-financed projects will last for twenty years across multiple Philippine administrations but the construction period would mostly happen now during Duterte’s term.” The Duterte government cared more about meeting the president’s own political needs on the projects’ timeline and was willing to accept a higher interest rate as part of the bargain. Duterte and his negotiators made concessions on the financing terms to secure their preferred operational timeline. Reportedly, the timing was a higher political and domestic priority for Duterte himself.28  Regarding environmental and social impacts of the infrastructure projects in question, Camba has indicated that, based upon his research (including interviews with interested parties), the Philippine government conducted “superficial” environmental impact assessments to the surrounding areas, which caused environment groups to criticize the projects.29  In addition, local residents and authorities reportedly were not consulted on the development of the projects, which will displace a number of indigenous communities from their ancestral territories.30                                                     27 Id. 28 Camba, supra note 10, at 20. 29 Id. at 4, 9, 12, 21, 23. 30 Id. at 4, 21, 22. \f Caribbean \fThe Law Library of Congress 128 Caribbean Countries Ruth Levush Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY Caribbean countries have reportedly signed a number of Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) agreements with China in recent years. The text of these agreements, however, is not readily available. China’s Caribbean portfolio includes highways and bridges, housing, energy, mining, airports and seaports, tourism projects, hospitals and official residences. Several port projects involving partnership with China began before the recipient country formally joined the BRI. These projects have allegedly served as incentives in the formal negotiation process, which is not available in the public record.   Flagship projects in the Caribbean include the construction of a 2,000-acre special economic zone and modernization of the main deep-water cargo port in Antigua and Barbuda, building a dry dock facility in Trinidad and Tobago, and a transshipment port and industrial park in Jamaica. Some BRI projects have raised environmental concerns in addition to concerns about potential violations of procurement processes, fair labor practices, and building and other codes in the relevant countries.   I.  Introduction  By March 2021, seven Caribbean countries had reportedly signed Belt and Road Initiative [BRI] agreements with China: Antigua and Barbuda (A&B), Barbados, Dominica, Grenada, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago (T&T).1   A December 2019 report by the Caribbean Investigative Journalism Network (CIJN) estimated the total Chinese investment in the Caribbean to be $8.25 billion in the preceding 25 years, with an additional $8.92 billion expected for upcoming projects. China’s Caribbean portfolio “includes highways and bridges, housing, energy, mining, air and sea ports, tourism projects, hospitals, and even official residences, forming a part of that country’s strategic thrust into Latin American and the Caribbean.”2  The Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) projected that the region would need about $30 billion to modernize its infrastructure over the next decade. Estimates by the Inter-American Development Bank as of November 14, 2017, indicated that Latin America and the Caribbean together needed an additional $120 billion to $150 billion per year in investment to close their                                                  1 Jennifer Hillman & David Sacks, China’s Belt and Road: Implications for the United States (Table, The Belt and Road Initiative Has Gone Global), Council on Foreign Rel.

Describing the strategic geopolitical and economic goals behind the $4 trillion T&T’s BRI MoU, Prime Minister Keith Rowley stated:    We told them we need your investment and you need our location in the Caribbean . . . As the world economy evolves . . . so too must T&T: “Foreign investment came to this country from Britain and later from the United States, and all along we’ve had this foreign investment inflow. But today China is the world’s second-largest economy so while the economy of Britain drove us for a while and the US for another period, if we are to tap into serious inflows of foreign direct investment we have to look into countries that are looking for investment opportunities abroad and China is that today.”5   We were unable to locate specific data on investments and external public debt accrued to China resulting from BRI agreements in Caribbean countries.   II.  Legal and Policy Framework   There are a number of media and official Chinese reports on various Caribbean countries signing BRI agreements with China.6 The text of these agreements, however, does not appear to be publically available.  For example, BRI funding in Barbados, in addition to projects related to maritime and air transportation and infrastructure, was reportedly expected to include modern agriculture, marine economy, renewable energy sources, culture and sports-themed tourism, medical services, and health.7   China’s ambassador to Jamaica has said that BRI’s projects in Jamaica focus on infrastructure, trade, finance, and people-to-people exchanges.8 The MoU signed with Antigua and Barbuda in June 1018 reportedly “mentions projects such as roads, bridges, civil aviation, ports, energy and telecommunications.” Similarly, Grenada’s September 2018 MoU appears to focus “on                                                  3 Daisy Margaret Jane Streatfeild, More Than 230 Million Reasons to Invest in Sustainable Infrastructure, Hablemos de Sostenibilidad Y Cambio Climático (blog), Inter-American Dev.

Several port projects involving a partnership with China began before the recipient country formally joined the BRI. These projects have allegedly served as incentives in the formal negotiation process, which is not available in the public record. The exact start dates of negotiation and construction are similarly unclear. According to experts at the Tearline Project, “Given the actors involved and increased public/private/government favor towards China, it is clear that these are BRI projects.”10    Seven Chinese-financed port projects were identified in Central America and the Caribbean region by August 14, 2020. The projects spanned six countries and included container ports, cruise terminals, and dry docks.  Of those, one project was completed (in Cuba), one was progressing according to schedule (in A&B), three were behind schedule or delayed (two projects in Panama and one in T&T), and two were canceled (in El Salvador and Jamaica).11    III.  Major “Flagship” Projects    As noted in Section II above, Chinese investments in the Caribbean began before recipient countries formally joined the BRI. The following describes major BRI projects in the Caribbean region.  A.  Antigua and Barbuda  1.  Yida  Following Hurricane Irma in September 2017, China invested heavily in rebuilding efforts and other sectors of the A&B economy, especially tourism. The Yida project involves plans to construct a 2,000-acre special economic zone that will include factories, homes, and resorts. The project has inspired public opposition, as it allegedly “largely ignores environmental safeguards, thus increasing Antigua’s hurricane risk and destroying coastal vegetation home to many endangered animals.”12                                                    9CIJN Staff Writers, The Caribbean Engages the Belt and Road Initiative, CIJN (Dec. 1, 2019), https://perma.cc/3D2T-V78B.  10 Matthew Crittenden et al., China’s BRI in Latin America: Case Study—Ports, Tearline.mil (updated Aug. 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/KE7X-QTA3. 11 Id. at 4. 12 Id. at 13, linking to Gemma Handy, Antigua: Sprawling ‘Chinese Colony’ Plan Across Marine Reserve Ignites Opposition, Guardian (June 20, 2019), https://perma.cc/Q94D-4RD3.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Caribbean Countries The Law Library of Congress 131 2.  Expansion of St. John’s Deep Water Harbor  In January 2018, A&B signed an agreement with China Civil Engineering Construction Corporation Ltd., a Chinese state-owned enterprise, to modernize A&B’s main deep-water cargo port at St. John. The Export-Import Bank of China, a Chinese state-funded and state-owned policy bank, would finance the US$90 million contract with a low-interest loan. “Acknowledging complaints that China’s BRI can be non-sustainable, delayed, and utilize primarily Chinese laborers, Antigua and Barbuda’s Prime Minister, Gaston Browne, mandated that at least 40% of laborers must be local. There has been no recent public indication that China has not followed this mandate.”13 The construction of the port began in April 2018 and is expected to be completed in mid-2021.14   B.  Trinidad and Tobago  On September 7, 2018, the T&T government signed an MoU with the state-owned China Harbour Engineering Company Ltd. (CHEC) to build the La Brea Dry Dock facility over a four-year period. Accordingly, CHEC would finance 30% of the port with a direct equity investment. Concerns regarding the debt drew attention to whether there is sufficient demand for the dock, to whether the La Brea location is appropriate, and to the fact that the World Bank blacklisted CHEC for bribery. According to the Tearline Project,  [t]here was increased economic pressure for the Government of Trinidad and Tobago to partner with China for a large infrastructure project in the La Brea area after the Petrotrin oil refinery closed, causing over 5,000 people to lose their jobs and the region to lose its industry. The port will benefit the local area directly and indirectly. Once operational, it will generate $500 million USD annually, create training programs for community members on ports, support a more diverse local economy by consistently bringing in foreign business, and create thousands of jobs. This economic benefit, specifically the creation of 3,500 direct jobs and 5,700 indirect jobs during construction, is desperately needed in the region after the closing of the oil refinery. However, there is skepticism that the port will not generate the jobs that CHEC has announced for locals, due to the trend of importing Chinese laborers for large infrastructure construction associated with BRI, which is already occurring elsewhere in Trinidad and Tobago.  Per the Trinidad and Tobago government, the port will include two dry docks, a berth, land reclamation to support the proposed facilities, deep water dredging for the channel and turning basin, and necessary terminals to facilitate the operation of the port. However, despite the September 2018 agreement and the announced plans, our most recent imagery from late May 2020 shows that no construction has occurred, not even the beginning stages of land reclamation. The project has been further delayed by COVID-19 halting all foreign investment occurring in the spring of 2020. The indefinite delay of the project emphasizes how Trinidad and Tobago cannot build the port and bring business to the economically struggling La Brea area without Chinese aid. It appears that either the port is not a priority to the BRI or there are unpublicized reasons for its delay, as CHEC has continued to push                                                  13 Matthew Crittenden et al., supra note 10. 14 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Caribbean Countries The Law Library of Congress 132 back the project years after designs were finalized without any announcement about issues.15  C.  Jamaica  In August 2013, the Government of Jamaica announced that CHEC would be developing a transshipment port and industrial park on Great Goat Island and Little Goat Island. The project would have required leveling the islands to construct the necessary infrastructure and extensive dredging to accommodate Super Post Panamax ships. The project was subject to strong opposition as environmentally endangering the habitat for endangered species, leaving surrounding communities vulnerable to hurricanes, and destroying small-scale fisheries that sustain local communities. Prime Minister Andrew Holness, elected in 2016, announced that the Jamaican government would cancel the plans to build a transshipment port on the Goat Islands.16  IV.  Public Support/Criticisms; Assessment of Projects’ Impact    In addition to the public criticism of BRI projects described in Section III above, concerns have been expressed “about procurement processes and concessions related to local content, labour practices and adherence to building and other codes.”17  Among problems associated with BRI implementation are the following:   A.  Bahamas  Legal disputes associated with the $3.5 billion Baha Mar resort project constructed by a subsidiary of China State Construction Engineering reportedly led to a downgrading of the Bahamas’ S&P Global rating in 2015.18   B.  Jamaica  According to CIJN,  a 2012 independent forensic audit of the Jamaica Development Infrastructure Programme (JDIP) and the Palisadoes Shoreline Protection and Rehabilitation Works Project concluded there was “non-adherence to allocations approved by Parliament and the Ministry of Finance. There was also the arbitrary issuance of Variation Orders and selection of sub-contractors along with unprogrammed and arbitrary allocation of funds for institutional strengthening,” according to the audit document.19                                                    15 Id.  16 Id.  17 Carla Bridglal et al., supra note 2. 18 Id.  19 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Caribbean Countries The Law Library of Congress 133 C.

The initiative coincided with increased confrontation between Russia and the West, resulting in Russia’s attempts to leverage the BRI as an alternative to western investments, technologies and financial instruments while facing Western economic sanctions.     Two out of six transport corridors in the BRI cross Russia, and transport is thus an important component of Russian-Chinese cooperation. Transport corridors are seen as vital to developing poorer Chinese provinces bordering Russia and Mongolia. Nevertheless, the dominant area of cooperation of two countries is energy. Two BRI flagship projects are the Power of Siberia natural gas pipeline project and the Yamal liquefied natural gas project. Russia and China have also intensified their cooperation in nuclear energy.   The BRI plays an important role in the broader context of Eurasian integration through the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the Shanghai Cooperation Organization (SCO), in which China and Russia play a leading role. The EAEU is a key partner in the BRI, since it comprises a majority of states covered by the BRI’s overland route. The BRI and the EAEU have formally signed an agreement of cooperation.    China’s Arctic strategy became another area of collaboration with Russia. Even though the security sector is not an official part of the BRI, evidence suggests China sometimes uses the BRI to leverage gains. Cooperation in the security sector is increasing and taking various forms, including the transfer of advanced technology and joint military exercises.    The legal framework for cooperation is multifaceted but opaque. While high-level meetings regularly result in packages of new agreements in the various sectors, the public is informed only of the titles of the agreements. The economic and financial parts of the agreements remain unavailable to the public and can be analyzed only through indirect evidence and information reported by mass media.   The Russian public generally is in favor of increased cooperation with China. Experts point to the highly political nature of implementing the BRI projects, and argue there are few benefits, including economic ones, for Russia. Several projects caused scandals, and environmental groups have raise alarms on the BRI’s ecological impact. In Central Asia, the public appears more concerned about the impact of BRI projects, and anti-Chinese protests have periodically occurred across the region.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Russian Federation and Central Asian Countries The Law Library of Congress 135 I.  Introduction  China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was launched in Kazakhstan in 2013,1 is being actively implemented in Russia and other former Soviet republics of Central Asia. Working with these countries, China is focusing on two out of three major components of the Initiative, namely the land-based Silk Road Economic Belt (SREB), comprising six development corridors, and the Polar Silk Road, a northern sea route.2 Apart from Russia, these countries are landlocked, and thus are not involved in the third BRI component, the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road.3  The SREB refers to land-based trade corridors linking Asia and Europe by roads, railways, and pipelines.4 The New Eurasian Land Bridge Economic Corridor (NELBEC) and the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC), both of which go through Russia, are two of the six corridors of the BRI.5  According to the American Enterprise Institute’s China Global Investment Tracker, since 2005, China had invested US$34.76 billion in Russia.6 The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Russian Federation lists official statistics of Sino-Russian cooperation; te that in 2019, bilateral trade reached US$110.9 billion. In the first half of 2020 (the latest data available), the trade between two countries amounted to US$49.15 billion.7  In addition to Russia, BRI projects extend to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), created in 2014 to promote the free movement of goods, capital, services, and people within its five member states, Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Russia.8  The Joint Declaration on Cooperation in Coordinating Development of the Eurasian Economic Union and the Silk Road Economic Belt, signed in 2015,9 serves as the framework for partnering between China and the EAEU, as well as for bilateral agreements between China and individual member states of the Union. Under this framework and such bilateral agreements, China and the EAEU agreed to work                                                  1 President Xi Jinping Delivers Important Speech and Proposes to Build a Silk Road Economic Belt with Central Asian Countries, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, People's Republic of China (Sept. 7, 2013), https://perma.cc/CEK9-SJSS. 2 Belt and Road Initiative, https://perma.cc/DTC8-GHYD. 3 Enrique Martínez-Galán, The Financing of the Belt and Road Initiative: Blessings and Curses in Francisco José B.

It was believed that cooperation would be beneficial for both sides,10 regardless of the fact that the Chinese initiative is focused on broad free trade zones, while the Eurasian Economic Union provides for the protection of domestic markets from external players and a tariff-free zone only for its members.11 Even though the most recent strategic document for the development of the EAEU does not mention the BRI,12  member states agreed to enforce the Agreement on Trade and Economic Cooperation between the EAEU and China,13 Which is a prior agreement regulates the entire structure of trade and economic relations between the Member States and the PRC. Some analysts argue that inherited differences between Chinese and Russian projects and politically boosted integration plans ungrounded in economic necessity could potentially cause serious friction between the two sides.14  For the post-Soviet Central Asian states, China’s Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) and China’s overall economic influence became crucial factors shaping their economic development. China’s cumulative investment and construction expenditures since 2005 equaled US$34.68 billion in Kazakhstan, US$4.73 billion in Kyrgyzstan, US$2.32 billion in Tajikistan, US$6.8 billion in Turkmenistan, and US$7.7 billion in Uzbekistan.15   II. Legal and Policy Framework  A.  Political Cooperation at the Highest Level  Russian President Vladimir Putin and Chinese President Xi Jinping meet several times a year. A special state commission coordinates every meeting and agenda.16   In May 2017, Putin attended the Belt and Road High-Level International Forum in Beijing, where he held separate meetings with Xiand Li Keqiang, the Premier of China’s State Council.17   On July 4, 2017, Xi paid an official visit to Russia. During the meeting, issues of trade, economic, military-technical, political interaction and humanitarian cooperation between the two countries                                                  10 Gaziza Shakhanova & Jeremy Garlick, The Belt and Road Initiative and the Eurasian Economic Union: Exploring the “Greater Eurasian Partnership,”49(1) J.

A package of intergovernmental and commercial documents on cooperation between the countries were signed following the visit.18   In June 2019, Xi made a state visit to Russia.19 High-level negotiations were held in Moscow, and twenty-seven documents on cooperation were signed.20   The package included two joint statements, the Joint Statement on the Development of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for Collaboration in the New Era,21 and the Joint Statement on Working Together to Maintain Global Strategic Stability and Promote World Peace and Development.22 In addition, an Agreement on Settlements and Payments,23 a Memorandum on Assistance in the Creation of a Russian-Chinese Joint Scientific and Technological Innovation Fund,24  and other documents related to trade, agriculture, customs and aviation safety were signed by respective agencies of the two countries. The package also included specific agreements between Russian constituent states and particular Chinese companies in specific areas of investment and trade.  The Joint Statement on the Development of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for Collaboration in the New Era states that its objectives include deeper integration; close coordination and strategic collaboration on national development strategies; expansion of mutually beneficial economic, trade, and investment cooperation; innovation and improvement of concepts and mechanisms of cooperation between two countries; and development of new fields, projects, and technologies, based on principles of multilateralism. The countries agreed to “solve international and regional problems, do justice in international affairs, and promote the formation of a more just and reasonable multipolar world that benefits the peoples of the world and to achieve win-win cooperation.”25                                                  18 Press Statements Following Russian-Chinese Talks, President of Russia (July 4, 2017), https://perma.cc/58F6-F2CD.  19 Joint Statement of the People's Republic of China and the Russian Federation on the Development of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership for Collaboration in the New Era, June 5, 2019, https://perma.cc/8MAS-EZRK (in Russian); Bilaterals.org, https://perma.cc/Y9HE-USEK (English translation).   20 Russian-Chinese Documents Signed During the State Visit of the President of the People's Republic of China Xi Jinping to the Russian Federation, President of Russia (June 5, 2019), https://perma.cc/7TVJ-X32V (in Russian). 21 Joint Statement on the Development of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, supra note 19.  22 Assistant Foreign Minister Zhang Jun Publishes a Signed Article on Jointly Strengthening Global Strategic Stability Between China and Russia, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China (June 12, 2019), https://perma.cc/5R28-EZBC.  23 Agreement between the Government of the Russian Federation and the Government of the People's Republic of China on Settlements and Payments, June 10, 2019, Pravo.RU, https://perma.cc/3ARN-CBTL (in Russian).  24 Memorandum of Understanding between the Ministry of Education and Science of the Russian Federation and the Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China on Cooperation in the Implementation of Joint Projects in Priority Areas of Development of Science and Technology, Dec. 6, 2012, Pravo.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry described the relationship between Russia and China as “a model of cooperation.”26 The prime ministers of both countries actively continued their interaction and follow-up regarding the decisions of their respective leaders.27 State academic institutions dedicated special research studies to this emerging and rapidly growing collaboration.28  B.  Cooperation at the Eurasian Economic Union Level  As noted above, the EAEU was established in 2014 as an economic union of its five member states: Armenia, Belarus, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and its founding member, Russia.29 The EAEU sought to introduce the free movement of some goods, services, capital, and people within its five member states by 2015.30 Russia intended the EAEU to partner with China, amid China’s own bilateral engagements with the individual members of the EAEU within the framework of the BRI.   In May 2015, Vladimir Putin offered to coordinate the BRI with economic integration within the EAEU.31  Guaranteed bilateral engagements with most of the EAEU countries gave comfort to China to safely engage with the EAEU without any significant extra diplomatic or economic costs.32 Coordination of the BRI with EAEU integration was officially reflected in the Joint Declaration on Cooperation in Coordinating Development of the EAEU and the Silk Road Economic Belt.33 In this declaration, China and the EAEU agreed to work on joint infrastructure projects and trade facilitation. Even though the declaration involved the five EAEU states, it was signed on behalf of the EAEU by Putin rather than the EAEU’s chairman.  The most recent strategic document for the development of EAEU–China relations is the Economic and Trade Cooperation Agreement of 2018.34 Also, the importance of the Greater                                                  26 Head of Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs Calls the Relations with Russia a Model of Cooperation, RBC (Dec. 24, 2019), https://perma.cc/HN8L-VZST.  27 Joint Communiqué, Heads of Governments of Russia and China, on the Findings of the Twenty-Fifth Regular Meeting, Dec. 2, 2020, https://perma.cc/8CLF-3DGP (in Russian). 28 Sergey Luzyanin, Zhao Huasheng, Russia–China Dialogue: The 2020 Model, Russian International Affairs Council (Aug. 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/7EDP-FE3Q. 29 General Information, Eurasian Economic Union, supra note 8.   30 Golam Mostafa, Monowar Mahmood, Eurasian Economic Union: Evolution, Challenges and Possible Future Directions, 9(2) J.

Legal Mechanisms Used in the Agreements  The acceleration of cooperation between Russia and China has been accompanied by multiple declarations on collaborative projects and signed agreements, but most of these agreements are not publicly accessible. Typically, the public is informed only on the general subjects of the agreements, without further details. In some instances, officials have invoked the need to maintain trade secrecy as the reason for lack of disclosure. For example, in 2019, the Vice Foreign Minister of Kazakhstan, Ermek Kosherbayev, said in an interview that the “founders of industrial projects with the participation of Chinese companies in Kazakhstan may be against the disclosure of commercial information.’’39 In numerous official statements, Kazakh authorities asserted that the reason for the lack of transparency regarding BRI projects is due to commercial privacy and has nothing to do with any hidden agenda.40  According to analysts, the BRI disproportionately involves state-backed players or sovereign governments themselves:   The BRI projects are predominantly built by Chinese investors, and such projects are disproportionately backed by Chinese state financiers, especially the China Development Bank, the Silk Road Fund and the China EXIM Bank. On the other side, many of the projects are directly backed or guaranteed by the BRI-targeted countries, especially in Central Asia.41  1.  Dispute Resolution Principles  It appears that legal institutions along the BRI routes are embracing international dispute resolution, because it takes time for investors to gain confidence in individual domestic legal systems, and there are significant challenges created by the different legal systems potentially involved in the cross-border BRI projects.42   However, a commentator has argued that the preferred use by the Chinese of friendly consultation, rooted in both its culture and its international legal instruments, makes it difficult for non-Chinese counterparts to bring Chinese parties before an arbitration panel. While the Chinese Government has signed dozens of MOUs with BRI countries, these MOUs are not legally binding, and almost none of them include specific dispute resolution mechanisms.43                                                     39 Dzjanbolat Mamishev, Why Not All Information About Chinese Projects in the Country is Available to Kazakhstanis: Foreign Ministry Refers to Investors’ Commercial Secrets, Kursiv.Kz (Sept. 2, 2019), https://perma.cc/UGM3-U6DD. 40 Yuri V.

Debt Issues  According to recent report of the Center for Global Development, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan are among eight BRI recipient countries that are at a high risk of debt distress due to BRI loans.44   Observers have noticed the general trend of BRI projects using low-interest loans as opposed to aid grants. Most BRI investments involved non-transparent bidding processes, which enable local authorities to capitalize through corrupt practices, and which involved contracts requiring the use of Chinese firms and equipment, and often the employment of Chinese workforce as well. The resulting inflated costs at times lead to canceled projects and political backlash.45    Observers also noted that the poorest countries of the region, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan, are vulnerable to debt shocks, as they borrow under unfavorable conditions to finance BRI-related infrastructure projects. Reportedly, in 2019 China held 40% or more of both countries’ foreign debts.46 Some publications expressed alarm about the implications of the BRI for these countries’ debt sustainability.47     3.  Financing of Projects  Experts note that Chinese credit is much easier to obtain than traditional World Bank or International Monetary Fund loans. Simultaneously, borrowing from China is non-transparent, and outcomes are subject of individual negotiations and in some cases political decisions.48  Tajik National University Professor Safovudin Dzhaborov describes the practice of financing BRI projects as “predatory lending,” which he argues applies to “a bilateral loan transaction between two states that, in addition to paying back the loan principal and interest, prompts the borrowing country to make statements containing certain promises and/or make economic or political concessions favoring the lender country or its agent, company or representative.”49                                                    44 Jonathan Hillman & Matthew P.

Reportedly, a rare exception was the construction of the Astana light rail transport in Kazakhstan, which was listed among the flagship initiatives of the BRI. Observers noted that money was delivered directly to the local company without involvement of the Chinese partner. It was discovered later that much of the funding had been embezzled, resulting in the prosecution of several former officials and leading to a dispute with China. Kazakhstan had to reimburse Chinese losses through its public treasury.50   4.  Land Ownership  All of the countries in Central Asia prohibit foreign nationals to own land. However, in March 2016, the Kazakh government announced amendments to the Land Code, allowing foreign citizens to rent and buy agricultural land. Proposed amendments generated massive rumors claiming that the land would be “bought up by the Chinese.” A wave of anti-government rallies swept through Kazakhstan.51 Protesters claimed that unfair land distribution would eventually lead to ‘Sinification.’52 Eventually, the amendments were put on hold.53   5.  Employment of Chinese Labor  Media reports on anti-Chinese protests in Kazakhstan state that one factor provoking  the protests were loan conditions in BRI projects requiring Kazakh businesses to buy Chinese goods and machinery, and in particular, to staff the projects with Chinese labor. Although infrastructure projects provide some employment opportunities for local workers, the use of foreign workers has at times led to discontent among the local population, particularly since such practices do not help address the region’s high unemployment.54 However, official statistics register significantly lower numbers of Chinese workers than are perceived by the public. Kazakh authorities annually impose a special quota for foreign workers, but it is unclear if Chinese workers on BRI projects are covered by the quota.55  Addressing these public concerns, as well as the lack of transparency in BRI-related agreements, the Kazakh Foreign Ministry stressed that Kazakhstan considered China a source of new                                                  50 Ainur Koskina, Astana LRT: A Project or a Scam?, Central Asian Bureau for Analytical Reporting (Dec. 24, 2019), https://perma.cc/F3SD-629C. 51 Abdujalil Abdurasulov, Fear of China Brought People to the Streets in Kazakhstan, BBC News Russian Service (Apr. 29, 2016), https://perma.cc/D94G-EVPV (in Russian). 52 Kazakhstan’s Land Reform Protests Explained, BBC News (Apr. 28, 2016), https://perma.cc/AXQ8-RF4Z. 53 Yuri Kulintsev, Are Anti-Chinese Protests in Kazakhstan Relevant to Russian Interests?, Russian International Affairs Council (Oct. 4, 2019), https://perma.cc/BRL8-ECGE (in Russian). 54 Andrey Zubov, Chinese Money Following Chinese Workers, Which Is Not Always Good—Expert, 365info.kz (Apr. 5, 2016), https://perma.cc/HWE9-634B (in Russian). 55 Quota for Attracting Foreign Labor Force (IRS) for 2021, PWC Kazakhstan, https://perma.cc/TN87-PEUG (in Russian). \fBelt and Road Initiative: Russian Federation and Central Asian Countries The Law Library of Congress 143 technologies and investment, and that Kazakh-Chinese projects provided for the use of foreign specialists only at the construction and initial operation stages.56   D.  Specifics of BRI Projects in Individual Industries   1.  Transportation  Two of the six transport corridors of the BRI cross the Russian Federation, and seek to build optimal transport routes along the China–EAEU–EU axis.    One BRI project, the New Eurasian Land Bridge (NELB), is an international passageway linking the Pacific and the Atlantic. This route extends from China's coastal cities of Lianyungang and Rizhao to Rotterdam, Netherlands and Antwerp, Belgium. The 10,800-kilometer-long rail link runs through Kazakhstan, Russia, Belarus, Poland, and Germany, and serves more than 30 countries and regions.57   Critics has argued this and similar projects have little economic value and that there are intrinsic difficulties in implementing such large–scale projects. Critics argue the New Eurasian Land Bridge Economic Corridor appears to be largely political in nature, and is aimed at providing an alternative supply route for Chinese goods if China were to face increased pressure on maritime routes.58 Also, the new route would help develop adjacent Chinese regions, which are far from coastal shipping ports, and otherwise would demand robust investments in Chinese infrastructure, linking more developed coastal parts with inland provinces. An economic justification is that air transportation of the same goods would cost much more, while the delivery time through the routes, two to three weeks, is significantly shorter than through traditional sea routes.59   Some researchers believe that from Russia’s perspective, the BRI would help capitalize on growing inland industrial centers and incorporate industrial and agrarian clusters into the larger international economy. The BRI routes would be most beneficial for Russia if it could help develop innovative and competitive production centers, create opportunities for small and medium-sized businesses, and provide a boost for regional development, these researchers say.60   Another of the six major BRI corridors is the China-Mongolia-Russia Economic Corridor (CMREC), initiated in 2016, which derives from landlocked Mongolia’s own integration project,                                                  56 Mamishev, supra note 39.  57 What are Six Economic Corridors under Belt and Road Initiative?

Such projects include the construction of a cross-border highway and railway, the development of transit transport, and the expansion of cooperation in the industrial, energy, tourism, educational, and scientific and technical sectors. The establishment of the CMREC is considered a promising step toward regional connectivity and economic development in Eurasia through the territory of Mongolia; the Mongolian initiative fits easily with China’s goals for the BRI, and matches Russia’s desire for active involvement in the project. Mongolia’s vision for the CMREC is much more than a mere transit zone between China and Russia.62 At present, 32 projects covered by the CMREC are being implemented.63   Challenges related to the implementation of the projects are similar for Mongolia and Russia. Both countries expect China to finance all those initiatives, with the likely consequence of increased dependence on China.64  2.  Energy Sector  The energy sector has been a dominant field Sino-Russian cooperation from the early days of the BRI initiative. China was seeking accessible energy resources for its northern regions, especially for the Xinyang province, while Russia was trying to reduce its dependence on European markets. Collaboration in the oil and gas sector has also triggered joint projects in petrochemical production. In these projects, China has emphasized requiring the use of Chinese equipment for the plants, having majority ownership in the associated businesses, locating processing facilities on Chinese territory, and using Chinese workers in projects on Russian territory.65  Both sides have kept the details of the signed deals secret. However, sources have revealed the substantial scale of the countries’ cooperation. The Joint Sino-Russian Energy Forum of 2018 resulted in twenty agreements in the energy field.66 The energy sector attracts most of the investments from China in Russia. According to Russian reports, in 2019, energy constituted 90.2% of all Chinese investments.67                                                   61 Tian Guangqiang, Steppe Road Plan (Mongolia), in Cai Fang, Peter Nolan, Routledge Handbook of the Belt and Road 554-558 (2019), https://perma.cc/6D69-7UP6 (available in Taylor & Francis Ebooks database).  62 Yelif Ulagpan, Belt and Road Initiative: Opportunities and Challenges for Mongolia, 19(3) Asia-Pacific Journal: Japan Focus no. 3, at 3, https://perma.cc/DHC7-MD5A. 63 Id.  64 Zorikto Dondokov, The Economic Corridor “China-Mongolia-Russia”: Problems and Development Prospects, 2018 IOP Conf.

In 2018, a major package of deals were signed between Russia and China to build several new units at China’s Tianwan and Xudapu nuclear power plants, as well as the construction of a fast neutron reactor.68 The construction work at the Tianwan and Xudapu plants started in 2021.69 The Chinese Foreign Ministry called its cooperation with Russia on nuclear projects of great importance to Sino-Russian collaboration.70 The power units are expected to enhance China’s nuclear energy capacity to ensure a reliable supply of clean electricity to the country’s grid.71 The Chinese side also portrayed these projects as part of its efforts to tackle climate change.72  3.  Arctic Cooperation  A recent addition to the BRI is the Northern Sea Route, which derived from China’s Arctic Policy.73 “In June 2017, the State Committee for Development and Reform and the State Oceanographic Administration of China named the Arctic as one of the directions of the BRI project. The ‘Concept of Cooperation at Sea within the Framework of the BRI’ refers to the need to involve Chinese companies in the commercial use of Arctic transport routes.”74 Russia has signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the Chinese Oceanographic Administration, aimed at expanding international cooperation in the Arctic and Antarctic.75 Russia and China claim they have cooperated in Arctic for some time. Their first joint Arctic expedition was conducted in 2016, and a second was conducted in 2018 with the goal to “provide scientific support for the development of a Polar Silk Road.”76 China’s Arctic Agenda states that China will not favor any specific Arctic country and will respect international law and the sovereignty and jurisdiction of Arctic countries. 77                                                     68 Record-Breaking Contracts—Russia and the PRC Signed the Largest Package of Documents on Atomic Energy, Prime Business News Agency (June 6, 2018), https://perma.cc/BVM6-VMAC (in Russian). 69 Elena Teslova, Putin, Xi Launch Construction of Xudapu, Tianwan Nuclear Power Plants, Anadolu Agency (May 20, 2021), https://perma.cc/9C3P-D355. 70 Chinese Foreign Ministry Commented on Cooperation between Russia and China in the Nuclear Industry, Atomic Energy 2.0 (May 19, 2021), https://perma.cc/8Q2A-N7P3 (in Russian). 71 Joint Statement on the Development of a Comprehensive Strategic Partnership, supra note 19. 72 Nuclear Cooperation Shows China, Russia Determined to Tackle Climate Change—Experts, Belt and Road Portal (May 20, 2021), https://perma.cc/5SKA-XUD2 .  73 China's Arctic Policy, Belt and Road Portal (Jan. 29, 2018), https://perma.cc/EVP8-3T7F. 74 Maria Smotrytska, Implementation of BRI at Sea: South Maritime & Arctic Silk Roads, Belt & Road News (July 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/484R-XS6Z. 75 Maria Smotrytska, The Implementation of the BRI Project at Sea: South Maritime and Arctic Silk Roads, Modern Diplomacy (July 13, 2020), https://perma.cc/F3YZ-3FXX.  76 Xie Chuanjiao, Sino-Russian Expedition Provides Arctic Data, China Daily (Oct. 31, 2018), https://perma.cc/R5XU-B5Q2. 77 Elena Kienko, International Legal Framework for Cooperation of China with the Arctic States, 2019(2) J.

Military Cooperation  Military and security cooperation is not officially encompassed by the BRI. However, there are multiple indirect signs that China leverages economic engagement for achieving its security objectives.78 China and Russia have signed major BRI deals that correspond in time with the decisions of Russia to share its most advanced military technology with China. For example, the Power of Siberia deal to supply natural gas to China did not go forward until Russia decided to sell to China its advanced S-400 air defense missile system,79 which was later followed with its sale of its flagship Su-35 aircraft.80   According to analysts, Russia’s worsening relationship with the West encouraged Russia’s further collaboration with China in the military domain. Allegedly, the trust and partnership developed during implementation of the BRI projects gave Russia confidence to foster closer cooperation with Beijing by advancing Chinese capabilities that would challenge western technological military dominance.81 For example, Russia helped China to develop a missile early warning system.82 However, in 2020, Russia suspended its delivery of S-400 missiles, for reasons that are unclear.83  III.  Major “Flagship” Projects  A.  Projects in Russia  1.  Power of Siberia  A natural gas pipeline project, Power of Siberia, was initiated in 2014 between the Russian state-owned GAZPROM and the state-owned China National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC). The deal envisioned supplying 38 billion cubic meters of natural gas to China annually for 30 years.84 It took 10 years to negotiate the deal. Unlike in previous cases, China did not offer any credit, but                                                  78 Joel Wuthnow, Chinese Perspectives on the Belt and Road Initiative: Strategic Rationales, Risks, and Implications, Center for the Study of Chinese Military Affairs, Institute for National Strategic Studies, China Strategic Perspectives No. 12 (Oct. 2017), https://perma.cc/C9J3-DAFR. 79 Zachary Keck, Putin Approves Sale of S-400 to China, The Diplomat (Apr. 11, 2014), https://perma.cc/XN5S-Y4QW.   80 Franz-Stefan Gady, Confirmed: China Buys 24 Advanced Fighter Jets From Russia The Diplomat (Nov. 20, 2015), https://perma.cc/UA8E-KQ4F. 81 Paul Stronski & Nicole Ng, Cooperation and Competition: Russia and China in Central Asia, the Russian Far East, and the Arctic, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Feb.28, 2018), https://perma.cc/4XQ7-XHQ3.  82 Chinese Missile Early Warning System—With Russian Help—May be Nearing Completion, Defense World.net (June 25, 2020), https://perma.cc/VN6S-MSQB.   83 In Another Setback to China, Russia Suspends Deliveries of S-400 Missiles, Business Standard News (July 27, 2020), https://perma.cc/JR8Q-GDY2; Mark Episkopos, Russia Halted S-400 Air Defense Sales to China.

Experts and some official statements underlined the political importance of the project over its economic value.89 Media sources reported that Russia even agreed to annul its mineral extraction tax specifically for this project, further decreasing its economic benefits.90 This project encountered major challenges in 2020 due to an inaccurate calculations in gas field developments, which further decreased the economic benefits for Russia.91    2.  Yamal LNG Project  The Yamal Liquified Natural Gas (LNG) Project, the largest one beyond the Arctic Circle, was launched in 2017. China’s National Petroleum Corporation (CNPC) owns 20% of the business, and an additional 9.9% is owned by the Chinese Silk Road Fund. The US$27 billion project was developed by the Russian firm Novatek, a privately-owned gas production company, the second-largest in Russia, which owns 50.1% of the project. Besides Novatek and Chinese companies, the French petroleum conglomerate Total holds 20%. The operational capacity equals 16.5 million tons per annum.92  The project faced financing challenges due to US and EU sanctions on Russia.93 It completed financing in 2016 with a US$3 billion loan from the Russian development bank VEB and loan                                                  85 Iacob Koch-Weser, Craig Murray, The China-Russia Gas Deal: Background and Implications for the Broader Relationship, U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission (June 9, 2014), https://perma.cc/E9KQ-DXQC. 86 Edward Chow, Sino-Russian Energy Relations: A Match Made in Heaven?, Carnegie Moscow Center, Carnegie Endowment for International Peace (Jan. 29, 2021), https://perma.cc/UD2R-6SJE.  87 Yulia Magdalinskaya, Doubling Overall Strength, Rossiyskaya Gazeta (Dec. 30, 2019), https://perma.cc/HC7S-5XAY (in Russian).  88 Mikhail Krutikhin, ”Historical Sideshow Act”—Mikhail Krutikhin on Why the Kremlin Needs the ”Power of Siberia,” Fontanka.RU (Dec. 2, 2019), https://perma.cc/8GDX-JGYG (in Russian). 89 Evlaliya Samedova, What is the \"Power of Siberia\"?

In addition, Yamal LNG received the equivalent of US$2.4 billion from Russia's National Welfare Fund.96 The project became partly operational in 2017, and after some delays is reportedly now running at full capacity.97   In February 2021, Novatek and Chinese state-owned Shenergy Group Company signed a 15-year agreement under which Novatek will supply 3 million tons of LNG annually.98 It will come from the Arctic LNG 2 project, which is the next phase of the Yamal project, and which will have 19.8 million tons per annum capacity.99 All products of the project are Asia bound and are aimed at diversification of Russia’s gas supply markets.100 Novatek’s owners are believed to be close associates of President Putin, and one of them, Gennady Timchenko, as well as Novatek itself, are subject to US sanctions.101   B.  Projects in Kazakhstan   At present, Kazakhstan is the leading destination in the Central Asian region for Chinese investments, absorbing 80% of such investment; Chinese investment in Kazakhstan exceeds US$70 billion. More than a half has been in the energy sector, with the next largest sector being infrastructure. Chinese investors own 24% of Kazakhstan’s oil production assets and 13% of its gas production assets.102  In order to match the BRI institutionally, the Government of Kazakhstan began its own initiative called “Nurly Zhol,” the State Program for Infrastructural Development. Its goals include infrastructural support for and transport links between the territories; an efficient transit, export and logistics infrastructure; increased economic efficiency and competitiveness of transport                                                  94 Russia's VEB Guarantees $3 bln of Yamal LNG Debt (June 24, 2016), Reuters, https://perma.cc/9DU4-B4GF.  95 David Rowlands, Yamal LNG Project Financing Reaches Final Stage, LNG Industry (Oct.30, 2015), https://perma.cc/9E6P-3YW7.  96 German, Swedish, Chinese, Russian, Japanese, Italian and French ECAs Support Yamal LNG Project, ECA Watch (Apr. 21, 2017), https://perma.cc/T7J9-ZNVE. 97 Atle Staalesen, New Yamal LNG Plant is Made in Russia.

Projects in Kyrgyzstan  Kyrgyzstan’s experience with a project to reconstruct an aging heat and power plant in Bishkek illustrates China’s involvement in Central Asia. When officials were considering bids on the project, the Chinese Embassy in Kyrgyzstan reportedly put pressure on Kyrgyzstan’s Ministry of Energy and Ministry of Foreign Affairs, recommending a Chinese company, TBEA, as the sole contractor for the project, and hinting that a loan from China to the Kyrgyzstan government was linked to that selection. Consequently, a more experienced contractor, Russia’s Inter RAO, was passed over, as was another Chinese contractor, China Machinery Engineering Corporation. The unsuccessful modernization implemented by TBEA resulted in a breakdown in January 2018 that left a large part of the Kyrgyz capital without heating and electricity during bitterly cold weather.104  The failure of the heating and power plant was interpreted by local media as the result of China’s “neo-colonialism” in Central Asia.105  D.  Projects in Tajikistan  In Tajikistan, priority economic projects are focused in the mining industry, especially gold, silver, and rare earths like antimony. Thus far, 80% of Tajikistan’s mining industry has been developed by joint Chinese-Tajik companies, and Chinese interest in investing in the Tajik mining sector is likely to continue to grow.106 Observers say projects in this sector are the subject of various controversies, lack transparency, and raise serious questions among both experts and the Tajik population.107  In some cases, Chinese companies own 100% of a business, such as in the case of a London-listed company called China Nonferrous Gold, which was the first foreign company to own a 100% stake in a mine in Tajikistan.108  This project entailed serious controversy. According to media reports, China Nonferrous Gold paid a consulting company owned by the Tajik president’s son-in-law, Shamsullo Sakhibov, US$2.7 million for the gold mining concession.109                                                    103 State Program of Infrastructural Development of the Republic of Kazakhstan “Nurly Zhol” for 2020-2025, Official Informational Portal of the Prime Minister of the Republic of Kazakhstan, https://perma.cc/6M6X-VQR3 (in Russian).  104 A.

The gold mine concession served as payment for construction of the power plant, and benefits from the mine will go to TBEA until the full amount of its costs in building the power plant is recouped.111   Tajikistan is the only republic in Central Asia which hosts a Chinese military base,112 demonstrating China’s desire to complement its economic interests with military posture. The Tajikistan base may be important to Chinese efforts to include Afghanistan as a part of the BRI project.113  IV. Public Support and Criticisms; Assessment of Projects’ Impact    It is hard to get accurate information on public attitudes in Russia toward the BRI project given the controlled media environment in Russia and the massive propaganda efforts of the government. The BRI’s major projects are not subject to public debate or scrutiny of their economic or environmental impact.114 This is also the case in China.115   However, some studies indicate attitudes of the Russian public toward Russia’s relationship with China, which could indirectly suggest views toward the BRI. A joint Chicago Council on Global Affairs-Levada Analytical Center report based on data from multiple surveys finds generally favorable views of the Russian public to the growing bilateral relationship.116 According to these surveys, three out of four Russians (74%) express a favorable view of China. Nearly six in ten (57%) believe that in 10 years, Russia and China will grow closer. A majority of Russians say their respect for China has grown compared to 10 years ago (56%), while fewer say so about their respect for Russia (42%) and for the United States (46%). More than half of respondents (55%) believe that Russia’s ties to China strengthen Russia’s position in the world.117 A separate study                                                  110 Dirk van der Kley, The Full Story Behind China’s Gold Mine-Power Plant Swap in Tajikistan, The Diplomat (Apr. 14, 2018),  https://perma.cc/G3T9-WHTD. 111 Tajikistan: Chinese Company Gets Gold Mine In Return For Power Plant, Eurasianet (Apr. 11, 2018), https://perma.cc/P73A-FFWD. 112 Stephen Blank, China's Military Base in Tajikistan: What Does it Mean?, Central Asia-Caucasus Analyst (Apr. 18, 2019),  https://perma.cc/YC2Y-DNPD. 113 Id. 114 Denis Volkov et al., Russia-Chinese Relationships, ANO Levada-Center (Mar. 30, 2021), https://perma.cc/H262-GY2N (in Russian). 115 Marc Ozawa et al., The Power of Siberia: A Eurasian Pipeline Policy ‘Good’ for Whom?, in Marc Ozawa et al., In Search of Good Energy Policy 305-335 (2019), https://perma.cc/X994-WQTM (summary). 116 Russians See Greater Reward than Risk in Closer Relations with China, ANO Levada-Center (Mar. 12, 2021), https://perma.cc/428D-HL8Q. 117 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Russian Federation and Central Asian Countries The Law Library of Congress 151 of the Levada Center on xenophobia and nationalism noted an improvement of attitudes toward Chinese individuals.118  Russian government officials have made efforts publicly downplay a threat of Chinese expansion into Russia, which indirectly confirms they are concerned such public fears exist. In a newspaper interview, Foreign Affairs Minister Sergey Lavrov said that fears of “massive Chinese expansion into the Far Eastern regions of the Russian Federation are ‘exaggerated’” and that “[t]he data that already 12 million Chinese citizens live in Siberia raises serious doubts about the reliability.”119   There have been no reports of public demonstrations against Chinese workers or businesses in Russia. This could be explained by several factors, including declining Russian population in its far eastern regions and the increased dependency of those regions on Chinese investments and trade.120  Unlike in Russia, opinion polls conducted in the Central Asian republics indicate that 69% of Kazakhstanians, 77% of the Kyrgyz population, and 30% of people in Uzbekistan are concerned with Chinese acquiring local land. These fears increased after Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan ceded some territory to the PRC.121 Respondents were also asked to rate their confidence that China’s investments “will improve energy and infrastructure in our country.” Only 6% of surveyed in Kazakhstan and 7% in Kyrgyzstan answered positively.122 Some experts argue that Sinophobia limits the ability of Central Asian countries such as Kazakhstan to borrow money from China at low cost.123     Serious anti-Chinese clashes and protests have periodically occurred in Central Asian republics.  In September 2019, right before the first state visit of the new Kazakhstani President, Kassym-Jomart Tokayev, to China, mass protests were held against an intergovernmental agreement establishing 55 agricultural and industrial enterprises in Kazakhstan with Chinese capital. In several provinces across the country, including the capital city of Nur-Sultan, protesters expressed their concern over transferring what they called Chinese “dirty manufacturing” to Kazakhstan.124 Later that month, a wave of anti-Chinese protests expanded to include China’s                                                  118 Xenophobia and Nationalism, ANO Levada-Center (Sept. 23, 2020), https://perma.cc/FB6D-PAS8. 119 Lavrov Urges Not to be Afraid of Chinese Expansion to the Far East,  Finanz.ru (July 17, 2019), https://perma.cc/YRJ3-CXQZ (in Russian). 120 Yuri V.

The directorate of the Naryn free economic zone planned to allot 170 hectares of land for 49 years for the construction of a complex of warehouses, terminals, hotels, catering enterprises and a gas station. Hundreds of locals held a series of protests, claiming the project was a “land grab” by China and demanding that the project be cancelled. In order to avoid a conflict, in mid-February the Chinese investor decided to terminate the project and sent a letter to the government of Kyrgyzstan demanding the return of about US$600,000 paid earlier.127   On March 27, 2021, Kazakh authorities detained at least 20 people as demonstrators staged anti-China protests in towns and cities across country. The protesters rallied against China’s increasing influence and economic power over Kazakhstan, and denounced the suppression of Uyghurs and ethnic Kazakhs in Xinjiang.128                                                    125 Elzbieta Pron & Emilie Szwajnoch, Kazakh Anti-Chinese Protests and the Issue of Xinjiang Detention Camps, Central Asia-Caucacus Analyst (Oct. 31, 2019), https://perma.cc/8ZH7-WU3M.   126 Olga Dzyubenko & Olzhas Auyezov, China-led US$280 Million Kyrgyzstan Project Abandoned After Protests, Reuters (Feb. 18, 2020), https://perma.cc/9DK2-ATAF. 127 Id. 128 Anti-China Protests Staged Across Kazakhstan; At Least 20 Detained, RFE/RL (Mar. 27, 2021), https://perma.cc/34JS-E4Y4. \f South America  \fThe Law Library of Congress 153 South America Graciela Rodriguez-Ferrand Senior Foreign Law Specialist    SUMMARY Only six South American countries have joined the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) investment program, beginning in 2018. Although many of these countries already had a longstanding investment and trade relationship with China, the BRI framework has provided a boost in funding, mainly in infrastructure and energy, including roads, ports, railways, power plants, and agriculture. In recent years, the BRI has also focused on public health, the digital economy, green development, and other new forms of infrastructure. Most projects in the region have involved a partnership with local companies or joint ventures as part of their involvement in the BRI. Concerns and criticisms of the BRI in Latin America involve the inefficient legal frameworks, regulatory risks, lack of transparency, China’s geopolitical interests, and the effect on domestic political issues.   I.  Introduction  The Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is an investment program launched by China in 2013 to advance regional cooperation, strengthen communications between civilizations, and safeguard world peace and stability.1 The content of the BRI includes financing and investment agreements focused mainly on infrastructure projects in Asia, Europe, Africa, and Latin America. Even though the economic impact of BRI investment is important, its geopolitical consequences cannot be underestimated, because it reinforces China’s capacity to strengthen itself as a regional and global leader.2  Although China has long-standing links with a number of Latin American countries, the region is a relatively recent addition to BRI.3 Since its inception, 19 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean have signed up, including Bolivia, Chile, Ecuador, Uruguay, and Venezuela in 2018 and Perú in 2019.4 However, other countries like, Argentina and Colombia, who are not BRI members, have been recipients of substantial Chinese investment in recent years and have comprehensive bilateral cooperation agreements with China.5                                                    1 CMS Legal Servs., Belt and Road Initiative: The View from Latin America 4 (2021), https://perma.cc/ES3K-ZZ4F.

Legal & Policy Framework   In 2017, China began entering into memoranda of understanding (MOUs) within the BRI framework and BRI-related deals with governments in Central America, the Caribbean, and South America.10   Most projects in South American countries have involved a partnership with local companies or joint ventures as part of their involvement in the BRI.11  The official signing of an MOU has been announced by government officials of Ecuador,12 Bolivia,13 and other countries involved. However, the full text of most BRI-related MOUs is not                                                  6 Id. 7 Id. at 8.

Two exceptions are the MOU signed with Bolivia, which was published in that country’s official gazette,14 and the MOU signed with Uruguay.15  The basic structure of the MOUs includes the commitment to adopt policies for coordinating and deepening cooperation. Parties to an MOU agree on the following priorities of the BRI:  • policy coordination, • facilities connectivity, • unimpeded trade, • financial integration, and • people-to-people bonds.16   These five priorities are guided by the principles of extensive consultation and shared contribution benefits.17   Cooperation under MOUs has taken the form of a joint transportation infrastructure development plan, the building of industrial parks jointly with local companies, the establishment of sister-city networks, trade and investment promotion plans, and financial cooperation between Chinese and local and regional banking and financial development institutions.18   The terms of the MOUs are not legally binding.19 However, according to Chris Devonshire-Ellis, an expert in the BRI, “these agreements allow for the parties to formulate interpretations of certain parts of the agreements. . . . [C]ertain elements within the MoU could be interpreted by either party, and especially the Chinese. Such interpretations can, in fact, influence the way in which China views statements made within the MoU, and regard [sic] these as important in future diplomatic talks. In short, the purpose of these non-legally binding MoU is to influence, rather than direct.”20                                                   14 Ley 1170 on the Memorando de Entendimiento entre Bolivia y Gobierno de la República Popular China  Sobre la Cooperación en el Marco de la Iniciativa de la Franja Económica de la Ruta de la Seda y la Ruta Marítima de la Seda del Siglo XXI, Gaceta Oficial [G.O.], Apr. 25, 2019, https://perma.cc/34A7-T3GK. 15 Memorando de Entendimiento entre el Gobierno de la República Oriental del Uruguay y el Gobierno de la República Popular China sobre la Cooperación en el Marco de la Iniciativa de la Franja Económica de la Ruta de la Seda y la Ruta Marítima de la Seda del Siglo XXI, Beijin, Aug. 20, 2018, https://perma.cc/4Q4T-EJD5. 16 Sebastion Ibold, Cooperation Agreements and MoUs Under the Belt and Road Initiative, Belt and Road Initiative (Nov. 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/Y2W5-AMKG. 17 Id. 18 Id. 19 Id. 20 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Latin America The Law Library of Congress 156 According to Devonshire-Ellis, “The MoU appear [sic] largely benign; however, it does contain the seeds of what could, in future, be used as diplomatic tools in terms of insisting that agreements have been reached over certain areas.”21  III.  Major “Flagship” Projects    China has formulated priority areas of cooperation with Latin America within BRI, as follows:  To achieve this goal, China has proposed five suggestions in order to deepen cooperation in key areas:  •  Building of infrastructure by land and sea •  Opening of a large market to encourage trade and investment •  Cooperation in production capabilities  •  Ecological development and innovation •  Cultural and research exchange between the countries.22   While most of the BRI projects in Latin America concern traditional infrastructure, digital technology is an increasingly important part of the initiative in the region.23  Most of the Latin American countries that are part of the BRI already had an established trade and investment relationship with China.24 For example, Chile and China had a free trade agreement before Chile joined the BRI in 2018.25 The agreement requires the parties to act in good faith and forbids them from discriminating against each other’s companies.26 Both countries are obliged to protect investments so that their investments are treated in a way no less favorable than national investors or investors from any other country under equal circumstances.27 Expropriations, direct or indirect, are prohibited.28   Chinese companies are attracted to Chile for investment purposes because of its political and economic stability, sound legal system and strong regulatory institutions, free market economy, and high sovereign credit rating.29 Foreign investment policies, regulated under Law 20,848, allow foreign investors to remit profits abroad, have access to a formal foreign exchange market,                                                  21 Id. 22 La Construcción Conjunta de “Una Franja, Una Ruta” de China en América Latina 3-4, Biblioteca del Congreso Nacional de Chile (Apr. 10, 2019), https://perma.cc/2LP2-CVHP. 23 CMS Legal Servs., supra note 1, at 18. 24 Id. 25 Tratado de Libre Comercio China-Chile, entered into force Oct. 1, 2006, https://perma.cc/KK4T-FWXP.  26 CMS Legal Servs., supra note 1, at 24. 27 Id. 28 Id. 29 Id. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Latin America The Law Library of Congress 157 and have the right to be governed by the same legal framework as domestic investors.30 It also provides for legal protections against antitrust violations.31  Chinese state-owned companies in Chile have a past record of investments in renewable energy and public utilities as well as in natural resources such as lithium.32  In November 2020, State Grid Corporation of China acquired Chilean electricity distributor CGE for US$3 billion. CGE is Chile’s biggest power distribution company and its second-largest transmission company.33   However, tensions arose recently, caused by the negotiations for the so-called Chile-China transoceanic cable. The project would have become the first fiber-optic undersea cable connecting China and Latin America via Chile, and it was considered part of the BRI initiative.34 Chile started to receive pressure from the United States to refrain from contracting with the Chinese company Huawei for 5G technology in the project, however, to avoid the risk of China collecting sensitive data.35 Chile finally chose a route proposed by Japan for the first fiber-optic cable to directly connect South America and the Asia-Pacific region, with Australia and New Zealand as endpoints instead of Beijing.36   The MOU between Chile and China on the Cooperation within the Framework of the BRI was signed in Beijing in November 2018.37 It addresses integration of development policies and programs.38 Cooperation is focused mainly on infrastructure plans, including the building of roads, railroads, and bridges, and the development of civil aviation, ports, energy, and telecommunications.39 It also aims at expanding cooperation on investment, trade, and industry matters, envisaging the establishment of financial institutions in both countries and the increased use of local currency in investment and trade transactions between them.40                                                  30 Ley 20848 Establece Marco para la Inversión Extranjera Directa en Chile y Crea la Institucionalidad Respectiva, Diario Oficial [DO], June 25, 2015, https://perma.cc/J6XM-CLRK. 31 CMS Legal Servs., supra note 1, at 24. 32 Id. 33 Id. 34 Id. at 4. 35 How Geopolitics Shaped Chile’s Trans-Pacific Cable Route, BNAmericas (July 31, 2020), https://perma.cc/4VFX-9PF7. 36 Chile Elige Cable Transpacífico vía Japón Desairando a China, La Voz de Chile (Aug. 20, 2021), https://perma.cc/K7X3-RN9X.   37 China and Chile Have Signed a Memorandum of Understanding on Cooperation Along the Belt and Road, China Belt & Road Portal (Nov. 6, 2018), https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/home/rolling/70834.htm.  38 Chile y China Firma Convenio de Cooperación Sobre la Iniciativa de la Franja y la Ruta, Mundo Marítimo (Nov. 5, 2018), https://perma.cc/WG6E-HCQH. 39 Id. 40 La Franja y la Ruta Chile China, May 2019, Subsecretaría de Relaciones Económicas Internacionales, https://perma.cc/GH3Y-TV9K.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: Latin America The Law Library of Congress 158  IV. Public Support/Criticisms; Assessment of Projects’ Impact    China’s announcement of the principles guiding BRI 2.0 was viewed as a response to claims that BRI was disproportionately benefiting the interests of the Chinese state and Chinese companies over those of China’s partners in the BRI.41 Many BRI participants expressed concerns regarding transparency issues and environmental impacts.42 A key driver behind BRI 2.0 is a wish to ensure more non-Chinese participation in the BRI.43  Inefficient legal frameworks, regulatory risks, lack of transparency, Chinese geopolitical interests, and domestic political issues are the most commonly cited obstacles in BRI projects in Latin America, according to a survey conducted by CMS legal services.44   The legal risks in BRI projects derive from the fact that the BRI is based on “soft law,” such as non-binding MOUs and agreements on principles, which do not constitute formal treaties.45 This format gives flexibility to negotiate and implement projects, but at the same time, it poses risks in terms of project management, consistency, predictability, and transparency.46  The potential benefits of BRI investments in Latin America are clearly important.47 However, according to a survey conducted by the CMS European Interest Grouping,48 only 14% of Latin American businesses surveyed are considering BRI-related projects, with 6% having considered them in the past, and 80% never having considered them.49 Concerns are mainly based on the conditions imposed on the Latin American partners regarding compliance with labor and environmental standards, expensive financing, and payments in Chinese currency.50  In response to concerns expressed by international participants, China launched BRI 2.0 in 2019 to address many of the points of concern.51 The principles guiding BRI 2.0 include the following:  • Consultation, joint contribution and shared benefits; • Spirit of multilateralism;                                                  41 Id.  42 Id. 43 Id. 44 CMS Legal Servs., supra note 1, at 19, 26-27. 45 Id. 46 Id. 47 Id. at 18. 48 Id. 49 Id. 50 Roberto Deniz & María Sol Borja, China, the Fierce Partner, Armandoinfo (Oct. 22, 2017), https://perma.cc/NP8T-R7Q8. 51 CMS Legal Servs., supra note 1, at 13. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Latin America The Law Library of Congress 159 • Pursuing of open, green and clean cooperation; • Committing to transparency; • Promotion of sustainable development; • Adopting widely accepted rules and standards; • Respecting laws and regulations of participating countries;  • Prioritizing poverty alleviation and job creation; and • Ensuring commercial and fiscal sustainability of all projects.52  Chinese participants are enthusiastic about BRI 2.0’s increased emphasis on environmental and sustainability issues.53 However, many international participants are not yet ready to take advantage of the opportunities it offers, with some skeptical about the change it promises.54 China’s announcement of the principles guiding BRI 2.0 was viewed as a response to claims that the BRI was disproportionately benefiting the interests of the Chinese state and Chinese companies over those of China’s partners in the BRI.55 Many BRI participants expressed concerns regarding transparency issues and environmental impacts.56 A key driver behind BRI 2.0 is a wish to ensure more non-Chinese participation in the BRI.57                                                   52 Id. at 16. 53 Id. 54 Id. 55 Id.  56 Id. 57 Id. \f Western Europe  \fThe Law Library of Congress 160 Greece Kayahan Cantekin Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY The most important Chinese foreign direct investment in Greece that is generally considered associated with the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) is the Chinese state-owned enterprise COSCO Shipping’s interest in the Port of Piraeus. COSCO’s interest in the Port of Piraeus began in 2008 when a subsidiary of COSCO won a 35-year concession to operate one of the port’s container terminals, which became the Piraeus Container Terminal (PCT). Following the concession, PCT became one of the fastest-growing container terminals in Europe, and in 2019, it became Europe’s fourth busiest container terminal in terms of total container throughput. In 2016, COSCO acquired a majority stake in the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), which manages all other operations in the Port of Piraeus, including passenger and car terminals, and an additional container terminal. The apparent success of COSCO investments in Piraeus appears to have attracted the interest of Chinese enterprises in other FDI opportunities in various sectors in Greece. The commercial success of Piraeus under COSCO management notwithstanding, there appears to have been some resistance from Greek political leadership and labor groups to the initial concession and subsequent acquisition of the OLP by COSCO. The initial concession agreement was also the subject of proceedings before the European Commission, which found that certain provisions thereof constitute unlawful state aid under European Union law.    I.  Introduction  A.  Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in Greece  While Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe is mainly in the larger European economies (in particular, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy), it appears that Greece and several Balkan countries have received the bulk of the Chinese investments that are specifically within the scope of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was officially launched in 2013.1   Chinese seaport investments in Greece is a subject of major importance for observers of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) due to its commercial and possibly strategic implications. Since 2008, the Chinese state-owned enterprise COSCO Shipping (COSCO) and its subsidiaries have won concessions and made acquisitions that enabled COSCO to be the controlling actor in the operation of Greece’s largest commercial port, the Port of Piraeus, until at least the year 2047. COSCO, which among its subsidiaries has China’s largest container shipping company, has made particularly significant investments in the development of the container terminals in the port, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing major container ports since 2008 and Europe’s fourth                                                  1 Philippe Le Corre, China’s BRI: Implications for Europe, in US-China Foreign Relations: Power Transition and Its Implications for Europe and Asia 92 (Robert S. Ross et al. eds., 2021), https://perma.cc/9K3L-TLUY. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Greece The Law Library of Congress 161 busiest container port in 2019 in terms of container volume handled.2 Although they began before the announcement of the BRI, in the relevant literature COSCO Shipping’s investments in the Port of Piraeus are generally considered as being associated with the BRI, particularly the “21st Century Maritime Silk Road” strategic trade objective.3 The apparent commercial success of the project and its financial scale arguably makes COSCO’s investment in Piraeus the most significant among several other Chinese investments in Mediterranean ports in other countries.4  Piraeus functions as a terminus of the land transportation leg of the China-Europe Land-Sea Express Route (LSER), which consists of a railway line that ends in Budapest, Hungary, and stretches through Serbia and North Macedonia.5 The LSER infrastructure thus directly connects seaports in mainland China to central Europe. Compared to sea routes from China that use the large northern European ports, this route has a relative advantage in terms of travel time: The travel time of a container ship from Shanghai to Piraeus appear to be approximately 22 days, which is 10 days less than the time the ship must sail to a northern European port such as Rotterdam or Hamburg.6   Chinese investments in Greece are not limited to the Port of Piraeus. It has been reported that Chinese state-owned enterprises have been making major investments, especially in the energy and transportation infrastructure sectors; some commentators attribute Chinese interest in additional investments to the attraction created by COSCO’s successes in Piraeus.7  B.  Chinese Investments in Central and Eastern Europe   In 2012, a year before China officially launched the BRI in 2013, China and 16 Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries formed a platform for closer economic and diplomatic relations,                                                  2 Theo Notteboom, Top 15 Container Ports in Europe in 2019: TEU Volumes and Growth Rates, porteconomics.eu (Feb. 21, 2020), https://perma.cc/ZVJ8-KM3H; Eurostat, Top 20 Ports Handling Containers, 2008-2018 (thousand TEUs) (Mar. 6, 2020), https://perma.cc/M6AD-WU6Z; Eurostat, Top 20 Ports Handling Containers, 2009, 2018 and 2019 (thousand TEUs) (Dec. 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/UDC7-5U3E. 3 See, e.g., Xue Li, China-Europe Land-Sea Express Route with the Belt and Road Initiative, in Routledge Handbook of the Belt and Road 453-56 (Cai Fang & Peter Nolan eds., 2019); Philippe Le Corre, Chinese Investments in European Countries: Experiences and Lessons for the “Belt and Road” Initiative, in Rethinking the Silk Road 161 (Maximilian Mayer ed., 2018), https://perma.cc/KTN3-2CJF. 4 For an overview of Chinese investments in Mediterranean ports and a discussion about their impact, see generally Grant F.

Legal and Policy Framework  Greece and China signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) on August 27, 2018, regarding the two countries’ cooperation within the BRI.12 Thus, major Chinese investments in Greece identified in this report, in particular the port-related investments, predate the MOU and Greece’s joining the 16 + 1 group. As will be explored in Sections III and IV below, major port investments appear to have taken place following general privatization efforts on the part of the Greek Government in the context of the 2007-2008 global financial crisis and the subsequent European sovereign debt crisis. Investments appear to have been made generally in accordance with concession agreements concluded following competitive tendering subject to Greek public procurement law and relevant EU rules.   III.  Major Projects    A.  The Piraeus Container Terminal Concession and the Privatization of the Piraeus Port Authority: An Overview  In 2008, COSCO Pacific (now COSCO Shipping Ports Ltd., a subsidiary of COSCO Shipping, which is a Chinese state-owned enterprise) won a 35-year concession for the operation of container terminals on Pier II and the future Pier III at the Port of Piraeus.13                                                  8 The official title of the initiative is “Cooperation Between China and Central and Eastern European Countries.” See the platform’s website at https://perma.cc/RBT6-5L5G. The 16 countries include 11 EU member states, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czechia, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, and Slovenia; and five non-EU member states, namely, Albania, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, North Macedonia, and Serbia. Greece officially joined the group in 2019.  9 Tzogopoulos, supra note 6, at 6. 10 Rhode, supra note 4, at 406. 11 See Tzogopoulos, supra note 6, at 3-7; Zoltán Vörös, Chinese Expansion in CEE, 60(1-2) Der Donauraum 57, 59 (2020).  12 Mo Jingxi, China, Greece Ink BRI Memorandum, State Council of the People’s Republic of China (Aug. 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/DE7C-B9TF. 13 At the time, the Port of Piraeus included two piers that were capable of handling container ships, namely, Pier I and Pier II. The 2009 concession agreement included operation rights to Pier III, which was to be built by \fBelt and Road Initiative: Greece The Law Library of Congress 163  The concession was awarded following an international tender in which two bids were made; the call for tender required a throughput guarantee of 2 million TEU (20-foot equivalent unit) per annum by the sixth year of the concession and 3.7 million TEU by the eighth year.14 The initial duration of the concession was determined to be 30 years, with a five-year mandatory expansion conditioned on the concessionaire’s construction and operation of Pier III.15 The winner of the tender, COSCO Pacific, established a corporation in Greece named Piraeus Container Terminal S.A. (PCT), which it wholly owned, and which became the concessionaire under the agreement. Under the agreement, PCT is expected to a pay nominal sum of approximately €4.3 billion (about US$5 billion) in rent over the 35-year period, which consists of an initial lump sum payment of €50 million (about US$59 million) and periodic payments of a percentage of consolidated revenues plus lease cost calculated based on pier surface area and quay length.16 The concession agreement, which technically was between the Piraeus Port Authority (OLP), PCT, and COSCO Pacific, was finalized in November 2008 and approved by the Greek parliament in March 2009, whereupon the management of Pier II was transferred to PCT.17  The remaining container terminal in the Port (Pier I), the passenger and car terminals, and the ship repair bases located in the port remained under the management of the OLP after the concession, and thus, OLP’s Pier I operation became a direct competitor to PCT. In September 2013, COSCO and the Greek government concluded an additional agreement whereby COSCO would invest an additional €230 million (about US$272 million) for the development of Pier III to increase the capacity of PCT to 6.2 million TEU per annum; this additional investment was accompanied by other investments by COSCO, including the completion of PCT’s railroad link and the construction of a distribution center in the port, of which COSCO owned 50 percent.18 In return for the promise to invest €230 million, COSCO was relieved of the obligation to pay the                                                  COSCO. Currently, all three piers are in operation and have their own cranes and facilities that determine their container-handling capacity.

Currently, as at the time of the 2009 concession, the entire Port of Piraeus, including container, car, and passenger terminals, ship repair bases, and the surrounding land estate, is leased by the Greek state to the OLP under a 45-year concession agreement signed in 2002 (amended later to increase the concession period from 40 years to 45 years for the purpose of accommodating the COSCO concession). Before the incorporation of the OLP in 1999 as a public company listed in the Athens Stock Exchange, the port was under public management. The OLP was fully state owned until 2016, when a majority stake was sold to COSCO Shipping.

During the same year, Chinese leaders visited Greece and concluded at least 19 agreements involving additional Chinese investments in the country.21  The privatization of the OLP was put on pause when the SYRIZA party led the government in 2015, but eventually the state followed through, and in August 2016, COSCO won a bid for a majority stake in the OLP, making the Port of Piraeus the first major seaport in the EU that was wholly managed by a Chinese company.22 COSCO acquired 51% of OLP for €280.5 million (about US$331.6 million) with an option to acquire an additional 16% by the year 2021 for €88 million(about US$104 million), conditioned on an additional investment of €300 million (about US$344.6 million) made to the port.23 The total value of the deal is reported to be €1.5 billion (about US$1.8 billion) when additional investments and revenue, dividends and interest that the Greek state will collect under OLP’s port concession is taken into account.24 The deal was approved by the Greek parliament in June 2016.25  The deal ran into problems regarding COSCO’s acquisition of the additional 16% stake in OLP when it became apparent that COSCO was unable to fulfill the mandatory investments on which release of the shares was conditioned. It has been reported that a significant portion of the mandatory investment concerned improvements for the port’s cruise ship terminals. Media reports suggest that COSCO suspended work on the improvements following the opposition of local residents to the development on environmental grounds and that COSCO blames the                                                  19 Frans-Paul van der Putten, Infrastructure and Geopolitics: China’s Emerging Presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, 18 J.

Post-Concession Performance of Piraeus Container Operations  Under the management of COSCO, the PCT’s container capacity and container throughput increased rapidly. In 2008, before the concession, it was estimated that Pier II had a capacity of 1.6 million to 1.8 million TEU per annum, which could potentially be increased by 1 million TEU with appropriate technical upgrades, and that the development of Pier III could add a capacity of 1 million to 3.7 million TEU per annum.28 The actual container throughput of the entire port was estimated to be approximately 433,000 TEU in 2008.29 After the concession, PCT became Europe’s fastest-growing container terminal in terms of throughput, with its throughput increasing to 2.7 million TEU by 2012, and to 5.2 million TEU by 2019.30 In 2020, the throughput was 4.9 million TEU.31 It has been reported that, in 2019, €395 billion worth of Chinese goods were transshipped via Piraeus.32  On the other hand, the performance of Pier I, which was operated by OLP, remained relatively stagnant until after COSCO Shipping acquired a majority share in OLP in 2016. OLP is still operating the Pier I terminal. According to OLP financial reports, Pier I’s throughput was approximately 489,000 TEU in 2019 and 541,000 TEU in 2020, increasing from approximately 204,000 TEU in 2016, the year COSCO acquired its shares in OLP.33 The 2020 financial report ascribes the increase primarily to COSCO’s contribution in bringing in transshipment volume.34                                                     26 Jens Kastner & Giannis Seferiadis, COSCO Faces Backlash as It Moves to Tighten Grip on Greek Port, Nikkei Asia (Dec. 29, 2020), https://perma.cc/88MK-8V3K; Angeliki Koutantou, China’s COSCO Hopes for Greek Deal on Piraeus Despite Delay—Official, reuters.com (May 28, 2021), https://perma.cc/GJ2G-NP68. 27 Id.; “We are looking forward to seeing all projects and requirements fulfilled on the part of COSCO in terms of this Master Plan, something that is a precondition for the enhancements of its share to the level of 67 percent as pre-agreed,” Greek Ambassador to China Georgios Iliopoulos, as quoted in Xie Wenting, Greece Relishes Transparent Chinese Investment, Looks Forward to Stronger Future Partnership: Ambassador, Global Times (Mar. 25, 2021), https://perma.cc/UM8X-7W7J.  28 Psaraftis & Pallis, supra note 14, at 34-35. 29 Bruce Barnard, Greece’s Piraeus Nearly Doubled Container Traffic in 2011, JOC.com (Jan. 30, 2012), https://perma.cc/K2GJ-LRUD.  30 van der Putten, Infrastructure and Geopolitics: China’s Emerging Presence in the Eastern Mediterranean, supra note 19, at 341; COSCO Shipping Ports Limited, Monthly Container Throughput (2019), https://perma.cc/NC4R-KBUY.  31 COSCO Shipping Ports Limited, Monthly Container Throughput (2021), https://perma.cc/BL66-CEEW. 32 Le Corre, China’s BRI: Implications for Europe, supra note 1, at 88. 33 Piraeus Port Auth., Annual Financial Report 2016 7 (2016), https://perma.cc/C3RX-K2QV; Piraeus Port Authority, Annual Financial Report 2020 33 (2020), https://perma.cc/2EYY-D892. 34 Piraeus Port Auth., Annual Financial Report 2020, supra note 33. \fBelt and Road Initiative: Greece The Law Library of Congress 166 IV.  Public Support, Criticisms, and Assessments of Projects’ Impact    A.  Labor Issues  It appears that COSCO faced occasional opposition from labor groups since the beginning of its involvement in the Port of Piraeus. Before the concession of 2008, the civil service personnel and the dockhands working on Pier II appear to have been fully unionized, and they were apprehensive about potential loss of the jobs, overtime pay, and advantageous salary structures that a number of workers reportedly enjoyed (presumably based on legacy contracts from the time the port was under state management).35   The concession agreement appears to have included no provision regarding labor practices, other than the obligation to retain the existing workers of Pier II for the first 18 months of the concession.36 It has been reported that COSCO insisted on a pier “clean” of machinery but also workers, and that OLP received the displaced workers after they were made redundant by the PCT.37 PCT was reported to have directly hired a few hundred Greek personnel while not importing Chinese labor other than a few managerial level staff, and most of the labor appears to have been supplied by third-party subcontractors that hired workers on short-term contracts who were employed by PCT on an ”on call” basis.38 The workers of Pier II after PCT took over the operations do not appear to have unionized, and PCT appears to have structured its labor supply in a manner that circumvents any legal requirements necessitating union representation for its workforce.39  Nevertheless, PCT’s labor practices appear to have caused a significant increase in efficiency in the handling of containers at the PCT piers. The managing director of the PCT was reported to have said in 2013 that the performance of Pier II had increased from 12 containers per hour to 44 since COSCO took over.40 PCT’s abandonment of the labor practices based on a collective bargaining agreement that were in force before the concession and were still in force in the OLP-operated pier at the time appears to have reduced PCT’s labor costs by 30% relative to OLP’s                                                  35 Meunier, supra note 20; “In fact, the annual salaries of a few dockers, gantry crane drivers, straddle carrier drivers and selected other personnel working in the container terminal had reached exorbitant levels,” Psaraftis & Pallis, supra note 14, at 33. 36 Psaraftis & Pallis, supra note 14, at 36; Pavlos Hatzopoulos et al., The Containment of Labour in Accelerated Global Supply Chains: The Case of Piraeus Port, 8(1) Work Org.

Nevertheless, PCT workers were able to obtain some concessions from PCT following a strike, which took place in 2014.

However, it appears that by 2014, public and political opposition to the concession somewhat subsided in light of the new investments and commercial success of the enterprise, while the official positions of the labor unions remained in opposition.43  B.  European Commission’s Investigation into Violation of EU State Aid Rules  In April 2009, Piraeus Prefect Yiannis Michas filed a complaint with the European Commission alleging that the tax exemptions and other favorable provisions included in PCT’s concession agreement constituted unlawful state aid to the concessionaire under EU law.44 Subsequently, the Federation of Greek Port Workers and the International Dockworkers’ Council also filed complaints including similar allegations.45 The European Commission held that eight favorable measures contained in the concession agreement were in violation of EU law and ordered Greece to recover from the PCT and its parent COSCO the aid improperly granted.46                                                     41 Id. at 13. 42 van der Putten, Chinese Investment in the Port of Piraeus, Greece: The Relevance for the EU and the Netherlands, supra note 18, at 16. 43 Id. at 15, n. 50.  44 Commission Decision 2015/1827 of Mar. 23, 2015, 2015 O.J.

The European Commission found that the following state aid measures were in violation of article 108(3) of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union: “[1] Exemption from income tax on interest accrued until the date of the commencement of operation of Pier III; [2] Right to VAT credit refund irrespective of the stage of completion of the contract object; definition of the notion of ‘investment good’ for the purposes of VAT rules; right to arrear interests from the first day following the 60th day after the VAT refund request; [3] Loss carry-forward without any temporal limitation; [4] Choice among three depreciation methods concerning the investment costs of the reconstruction of Pier II and the construction of Pier III; [5] Exemption from stamp duties on the loan agreements and any ancillary agreement for the funding of the project; [6] Exemption from taxes, stamp duties, contributions and any rights in favour of the State or third parties on the contracts between the creditors of the loan agreements under which are transferred the obligations and rights resulting therefrom; [7] Exemption from stamp duties for any compensation paid by PPA [i.e. OLP] to PCT under the Concession contract, which is outside the scope of the VAT code; [8] Protection under the special protective regime for foreign investments.” Id. art. 1. The seventh finding on stamp duties was amended after Greece showed that certain types of stamp duties were generally abolished prior to the concession agreement. See Commission Decision 2018/612.

Impact on Greek Foreign Relations  Some commentators have suggested the existence of a relationship between Chinese FDI in Greece and the Greek government’s successful efforts to block the EU from criticizing China’s human rights practices in the UN Human Rights Council in 2017.47 Greece (together with Croatia and Hungary) has also played a role in the watering down of an EU statement responding to an arbitral decision of a tribunal based in The Hague that was generally considered to be against China’s interests in a case brought by the Philippines regarding disputes in the South China Sea, preventing an explicit call in the statement for China to abide by the ruling.48  D.  Commentary on Strategic Implications  Some commentators have pointed out the port’s strategic importance for military purposes and its implications for Greece’s defense and for the military forces of Greece’s allies that could expect to rely strategically on the Port of Piraeus.49                                                      47 Jennifer Hillman & David Sacks, China’s Belt and Road: Implications for the United States, Independent Task Force Report No. 79 50, Council on Foreign Rel.

However, China is one of the largest foreign direct investors in Sweden, with about 36 billion SEK (about US$4.25 billion) worth of investments in 2018. In addition, Sweden is one of the members of the European Union that received the most foreign direct investment from China in 2019.   China has expressed a desire to create a “Polar Silk Road” transportation route into and through the Polar Region, including the Nordic countries Finland, Norway, and Sweden. Currently, no initiatives with respect to the Polar Silk Road have been implemented in the Nordic countries.     Chinese investment projects have been scrapped in Sweden and the Nordic countries because of public criticism.    The Swedish government has been reluctant to endorse the BRI or a Polar Silk Road, and government agencies, in particular the Swedish Armed Forces and the Security Police, have argued against Chinese investments in Sweden. On the other hand, Swedish trade and business interest groups have argued in favor of Sweden becoming involved in the BRI.       I.  Introduction  A. Chinese Direct Investments in and Relation to Nordic Countries  Sweden, as is true of all the Nordic countries, is not a BRI member state.1 However, China is a large exporter of goods to all the Nordic countries, and, in particular, in 2019 both Finland and Sweden ranked among the top five countries in the European Union (EU) receiving Chinese foreign direct investment.2 Chinese foreign direct investment in Sweden amounted to close to 36 billion SEK (about US$4.25 billion) in 2018.3 According to the Swedish government, this was largely a result of Geely investments in AB Volvo, totaling about 31 billion SEK (about US$3.5                                                  1 See Mikael Weissmann & Elin Rappe, Sweden’s Approach to China’s Belt and Road Initiative, Belt & Road (Dec. 27, 2017), https://perma.cc/WP4G-YQLT.

Polar Silk Road Initiative  In January of 2018, the Chinese government announced that it was establishing a “Polar Silk Road” initiative to create Arctic transportation routes.6 No projects have been initiated yet, but China previously expressed interest in investing in transportation routes in northern Finland, Sweden, and Norway. In particular, China has reportedly shown interest in a proposed railway from Rovaniemi, Finland, to Kirkenes, Norway, which would give China access to the Norwegian arctic coast.7 The regional council in Lapland, Finland, scrapped that project in May of 2021, following criticism from indigenous groups.8   The Nordic governments, including Sweden, have not publicly expressed any interest in a Polar Silk Road. On the contrary, the Swedish Foreign Affairs Committee of the Swedish Parliament has expressed support for the ”government ambition that Sweden together with like-minded countries and the EU should cooperate and act jointly in response to the issue of the challenges and possibilities that an increased Chinese presence globally entails.”9   C. Huawei Banned from 5G Network Bid   In 2020, the Swedish Post and Telecommunication Authority (PTS) excluded Huawei products from a national bid to create its 5G network, citing national security.10 Huawei brought the matter to court, and on June 22, 2021, the Administrative Court declared that, based on the national security interest, the limits on the bid were both proportional and legal.11 In its decision, the court pointed out that the Swedish Security Police (Säkerhetspolisen, Säpo) had designated China as one of the most severe threats with respect to foreign espionage.12 The court determined that                                                  4 Id.  5 Cary Huang, 57 Nations Approved as Founder Members of China-Led AIIB, South China Morning Post (Apr. 15, 2015), https://perma.cc/TVM9-G7BF; Weissmann & Rappe, supra note 1. 6 China’s Arctic Policy, Belt & Road Portal (Jan. 29, 2018), https://eng.yidaiyilu.gov.cn/zchj/qwfb/46076.htm.

II.  Policy Framework   The Swedish parliament and government publicly are largely in agreement that the relationship with China should be managed jointly with other Nordic and European Union countries.16 In a 2019 government report, the government described Chinese direct investments related to the BRI as investments that “may contribute to meet the global demand for investments in infrastructure. At the same time, there are several clear examples that China is using BRI as a way to export its industrial excess capacity, and that local and other country alternatives are competed out by attractive financing solutions that mix financial and export credits and are sometimes accompanied by demands for political counter measures from the recipient nations.”  Swedish government agencies, in particular the Swedish Armed Forces and the Security Police, have warned against foreign direct investment from China. For example, the Swedish Defense Research Agency issued a report in 2020 where it stated that Chinese foreign direct investment “can have negative consequences for Swedish security” and “be a security risk in connection to an investment.”17 Similarly, the Swedish Security Police recommended against Chinese involvement in infrastructure projects such as the 5G network (see Section I.C. above) and flagged Chinese espionage in Sweden more broadly.18  III.  Major “Flagship” Projects    As Sweden is not a party to the BRI and has yet to commit to the Polar Silk Road Initiative, there are no major flagship projects in Sweden currently.   IV.

For example, in 2018, a Chinese investment in a deep harbor in Lysekil was canceled, following objections from the local community.19 Similarly, in neighboring Finland, the Rovaneimi-Kirkenes railroad plan was scrapped following public objection.20  Other groups have argued that Sweden should participate more actively in Chinese BRI investments. For example, in 2017, researchers at the Institute for International Affairs called the Swedish response to the BRI “too reactive and too passive.”21 The researchers called for increased collaboration between the Swedish government and the Swedish business community in order to maximize the possibilities associated with the BRI.22 Similarly, the Swedish Trade and Investment Council (Business Sweden) published a report on the challenges and possibilities of the BRI for Swedish companies in 2019.23                                                    19 Martin Grill, Kineser Säger Nej till Djuphamn i Lysekil, SVT (Jan. 30, 2018), https://perma.cc/QA43-UDBQ; Janne Sundling, ”Protester stoppar Kinas djuphamn i Lysekil”, Fokus (Jan. 31, 2018), https://perma.cc/DM9W-8HVW (by subscription). 20 Liito, supra note 8; Nilsen, supra note 8.  21 Mikael Weissmann & Elin Rappe, Sweden’s Approach to China’s Belt and Road Initiative: Still a Glass Half-Empty 12, Swedish Inst.

In 2014, a free trade agreement between China and Switzerland entered into force. In 2016, Switzerland and China agreed to an “innovative strategic partnership,” with strategic dialogues held every year. In April 2019, a memorandum of understanding focused on financial and economic matters related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was signed to “further deepen the innovative strategic partnership between Switzerland and China and to expand areas of collaboration in trade, investment and finance for projects in third countries along the Belt and Road Initiative.” The Swiss China Strategy 2021-2024 welcomes the opportunity for closer connectivity between Europe and China, but adopts a cautious approach toward the BRI as there are “risks as well as opportunities.” No major flagship projects with Swiss cooperation were identified.    I.  Introduction  Since the 1980s, the bilateral relationship between Switzerland and China has been strengthened in all areas and covers diverse topics such as politics, human rights, business, the labor market and employment, science and technology, education, environment, migration, and culture.1 Since 2010, China has been Switzerland’s most important trading partner in Asia.2 In 2019, the bilateral trade volume amounted to 36 billion Swiss Francs (CHF) (about US$40.1 billion), making it Switzerland’s third most important trading partner overall.3 In 2014, a free trade agreement entered into force, which improved access to the Chinese market for Swiss companies.4 In 2016, Switzerland and China agreed to an “innovative strategic partnership,” with strategic dialogues held every year.5 However, companies continue to face challenges in the Chinese market.6 In 2019, China held capital of CHF 14.9 billion (about US$16.6 billion) in Switzerland, whereas total Swiss direct investments in China at the end of 2019 amounted to CHF 22.5 billion (about US$25.1 billion).7                                                   1 Federal Department of Foreign Affairs [FDFA], China Strategy: 2021–2024, at 15 (Mar. 2021), https://perma.cc/G6S2-G2LA.  2 Id. 3 Id. at 16. 4 Id. at 15; Free Trade Agreement Between the Swiss Confederation and the People’s Republic of China, July 6, 2013, https://perma.cc/6QBS-HQGA.  5 FDFA, supra note 1, at 15. 6 Id. at 17. 7 Id.  \fBelt Road Initiative: Switzerland The Law Library of Congress 176 In April 2019, a memorandum of understanding (MoU) focused on financial and economic matters related to the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) was signed between China and Switzerland.8 Its objective is to “further deepen the innovative strategic partnership between Switzerland and China and to expand areas of collaboration in trade, investment and finance for projects in third countries along the Belt and Road Initiative.”9   We were unable to identify specific data on external public debt accrued to China resulting from BRI agreements within the framework of the MoU.  II.  Legal and Policy Framework   According to the 2019 MoU, cooperation between China and Switzerland should be  enterprise-led, market-based, in compliance with international practices and norms, as well as the laws and policies of the countries benefitting from such cooperation. This cooperation should be based on economic viability and long-term sustainable growth, social and environmental sustainability, mutual benefits, consensus, inclusiveness, open and non-discriminatory procurement processes and a level playing field, in line with national development priorities as devised by the countries concerned and with the common pursuit of the UN Sustainable Development Goals.10  The press release announcing the collaboration stated that cooperation will be based on the following five principles:   (1)  Private capital for private projects,  (2)  Sustainable handling of debts,  (3)  Consideration of social impacts,  (4)  Environmental protection criteria, and  (5)  Transparency.11  The MoU invites companies from both countries to jointly explore opportunities for third-party market cooperation and encourages financial institutions to explore financing for such projects.12                                                  8 Memorandum of Understanding on Developing Third-Party Cooperation Between the Federal Department of Finance and the Federal Department of Economic Affairs, Education and Research of the Swiss Confederation and the National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of China (MoU), Apr. 29, 2019, https://perma.cc/B3TX-XRQ6.  9 Id. at 2. 10 Id. at 2, no. 2. 11 Press Release, Federal Department of Finance, President Ueli Maurer Meets President Xi Jinping (Apr. 29, 2019), https://perma.cc/ZB7G-VS2H.  12 MoU, supra note 8, at 2, nos. 3, 4. \fBelt Road Initiative: Switzerland The Law Library of Congress 177 The Chinese and Swiss governments aim to support these efforts by helping the establishment of platforms to exchange project information, identify specific areas of mutual interest, and facilitate cooperation. Where appropriate, the governments may participate themselves.13 In addition, the MoU envisages the establishment of a “Belt and Road Initiative competence-building platform” in Switzerland for high-level officials and executives from Switzerland, China, and countries in which BRI-related projects are carried out with a focus on risk management, project governance, and international standards.14 Lastly, the creation of a Switzerland-China third-party market cooperation working group to encourage third-party market cooperation between enterprises from both countries is proposed.15  III.  Major “Flagship” Projects   No major flagship projects with Swiss cooperation were identified. However, in January 2020, the Chinese ambassador to Switzerland stated in an interview with the Swiss newspaper Neue Zürcher Zeitung that “Swiss firms are deeply involved with the Belt and Road Initiative, for example ABB, Schindler, and Nestlé. In addition, the bank Vontobel has established a fund for Belt and Road projects together with the China Construction Bank. I have complained to the Swiss CEOs. They concentrate on their own projects, but do not talk about them in Switzerland. This is an important reason why the Swiss media and public does not know much about the Sino-Swiss cooperation.”16  IV.  Public Support/Criticisms   The Swiss China Strategy 2021-2024 welcomes the opportunity for closer connectivity between Europe and China, but adopts a cautious approach towards the BRI. It states that  [i]n view of its manifold relations with China, Switzerland has an economic interest in enabling a level playing field for Swiss companies to participate in BRI projects. Swiss actors can contribute to the development of sustainable infrastructure in the regions covered by the BRI. At the same time, Switzerland intends to systematically raise its concerns regarding compliance with international standards, especially with regard to environmental impact and working conditions, human rights, the rule of law, sustainable project financing and transparency. This constructive while cautious approach determines Switzerland’s actions in regard to cooperation in the context of the BRI.17                                                  13 Id. no. 5. 14 Id. no. 6. 15 Id. no. 7. 16 Das Interview vom Botschafter Geng Wenbing mit der renommierten Neue Zürcher Zeitung, Embassy of the People’s Republic of China (Feb. 17, 2020), https://perma.cc/65PK-73QM.  17 FDFA, supra note 1, at 24. \fThe Law Library of Congress 178 Portugal Eduardo Soares Senior Foreign Law Specialist   On December 5, 2018, China and Portugal signed 17 bilateral agreements during a visit of  Chinese President Xi Jinping to the country.  According to a press release issued by the office of the Portuguese Prime Minister, the agreements were mostly in the areas of finance and business, including a memorandum of understanding on cooperation within the framework of the “Silk Road” and 21st century “Maritime Silk Road” initiatives.1 The press release stated that this MOU establishes arrangements for bilateral cooperation within the scope of the initiative, covering a wide range of sectors, with emphasis on connectivity and electric mobility.2  It was not possible to determine further details of the MOU, as it is not available to the public, or, it seems, to members of the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic.3  A study of Chinese investment in the European Union, particularly in Portuguese maritime assets, mentions that one of its main objectives is to extend the Belt and Road Initiative to the “Portuguese Sea.”4 The study states that China considers Portugal an important link between the terrestrial and Maritime Silk Roads, and this is the reason why bilateral cooperation in this area became so important. The Port of Sines and the archipelago of the Azores are the points that have attracted most interest from China.5                                                   1 Visita de Estado do Presidente da República Popular da China, República Portuguesa, Gabinete do Primeiro Ministro, https://perma.cc/N3EH-8H5M.  2 Id. 3 On January 9, 2019, deputies Rubina Berardo and Fernando Negrão of the Portuguese Assembly of the Republic requested that the Prime Minister make available to the Assembly the full contents of the 17 agreements signed between Portugal and China.

It has not signed a memorandum of understanding with China to participate in the BRI due to concerns about certain aspects of the BRI, particularly about debt sustainability and concerns over whether China will maintain international standards. It is involved in the BRI by encouraging UK companies to finance these projects, and it is working to ensure the economic interests of the UK are not left behind and that any participation is structured in a way that does not contravene the UK’s strategic interests.    I.  Introduction  While the United Kingdom (UK) recently described China as “the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security,”1 the two countries continue to have significant trade ties,2 which have grown exponentially since 1999. China is currently one of the UK’s largest export markets and source of imports outside of the European Union (EU), second only to the US.3 In 2019, China was the UK’s sixth largest export market and the fourth largest source of imports, with UK exports amounting to £30.7 billion (approximately US$43.2 billion) and the import of Chinese goods and services into the UK amounting to £49 billion (approximately US$69 billion).4 UK businesses in China have found the most success in the consumer, pharmaceutical, and automotive sectors, along with financial services, although it should be noted that the export of UK financial services to China only accounted for 0.4% of UK financial exports in 2018.5                                                    1 HM Gov’t, CP 403, Global Britain in a Competitive Age: The Integrated Review of Security, Defence, Development and Foreign Policy 26, (Mar. 2021), https://perma.cc/9GH6-FRYE. 2 UK Businesses Urged to Benefit from Belt and Road Opportunities, Gov.uk (June 28, 2018), https://perma.cc/NHS6-GP2R.  3 House of Commons Libr., Briefing Paper 9004, The UK-China Relationship 14 (Sept. 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/2KBL-Q58H.  4 House of Commons Libr., Briefing Paper 7379, Statistics on UK Trade with China 3 (July 14, 2020), https://perma.cc/4KEW-N59L.  5 Id. at 18.  \fBelt and Road Initiative: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 180 In 2017, Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond welcomed the BRI as an opportunity to strengthen ties between China and the UK, proclaiming that the UK is a “natural partner in the West,”6 and that this is the “golden era” of UK–China relations.7   The UK has regularly engaged with China at the senior level about the BRI as it has developed.8 In 2018, the China Britain Business Council estimated that the UK could realize gains of £1.8 billion (approximately US$2.53 billion) annually from the BRI, which will “cover 65 countries, accounting for around 63% of the world’s population and 29% of global GDP.”9 The UK aims to ensure that it is considered the “premier global centre for funding and facilitating BRI projects.”10 The UK believes the BRI has the potential to accelerate trade and economic development, but has also expressed concern over the social, environmental, and debt sustainability risks that it poses to countries and communities in which projects take place. It wants any involvement in the BRI to “maximize the development benefits and minimize the risks of this initiative.”11 The UK’s Independent Commission for Aid Impact notes that, for UK companies to benefit from commercial opportunities provided by the BRI, international environmental, social, and governance standards must be met. It has acknowledged that “commercial and other incentives may work against China’s adoption and implementation [of these standards].”12  While expressing enthusiasm for the economic prospects offered by the BRI, the government has also acknowledged that China is a “systemic competitor”13 and is attempting to reconcile the fact that “China is an authoritarian state, with different values to ours”14 against the many benefits that engaging with the country brings. A House of Commons Committee concluded that China’s   increasing power and international assertiveness is likely to be the most significant geopolitical factor of the 2020s. The scale and reach of China’s economy, size of its population, technological advancement and increasing ambition to project its influence on the global stage, for example through the Belt and Road Initiative, will have profound implications worldwide. Open, trading economies like the UK will need to engage with China and remain open to Chinese trade and investment, but they must also protect themselves against practices that have an adverse effect on prosperity and security.                                                  6 Belt and Road Forum in Beijing: Chancellor’s Speech, Gov.uk (May 14, 2017), https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/belt-and-road-forum-in-beijing-chancellors-speech.  7 Belt and Road Forum: Philip Hammond’s Speech, Gov.uk (Apr. 26, 2019), https://perma.cc/TG3F-DCW9.

It has stated   China will contribute more to global growth than any other country in the next decade with benefits to the global economy. China and the UK both benefit from bilateral trade and investment, but China also presents the biggest state-based threat to the UK’s economic security. We will require a robust diplomatic framework for this relationship that allows us to manage disagreements, defend our values and preserve space for cooperation where our interests align.16  The UK government has stated that it intends to “continue to pursue a positive trade and investment relationship with China, while ensuring our national security and values are protected.”17    II.  Legal & Policy Framework   A.  Government Policy   The government aims to ensure that any “engagement with the BRI is consistent and aligned with UK strategic objectives”18 and is “focused on practical steps and collaboration to help ensure that projects are delivered in line with the highest standards in order to deliver sustainable development outcomes and deliver opportunities for UK and international businesses.”19   The UK’s National Security Council (NSC), a cabinet committee chaired by the prime minister that is responsible for national security matters,20 sets the “overall strategic approach towards China.”21 It “co-ordinates across Government and is central to ensuring an effective and strategic policy which promotes UK values and interests.”22 The NSC’s strategy on China is a national security matter and thus not publicly released, but the government has stated that  [the] broad areas of focus are: trading safely to ensure maximum economic benefit to the UK while protecting national security; China’s global role and the rules based international system; countering security threats; Hong Kong; human rights; people to people links; and                                                  15 Id. at 26. 16 Id. at 63. 17 Id. at 22.   18 House of Commons Foreign Aff.

Underpinning these areas of work is a further strand to increase capability and expertise on China across government.23  The government has placed the Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office (FCDO) as the lead “on the bilateral, foreign policy and geo-strategic strands of our China relationship.”24 This applies to BRI activities, and the intent is to ensure that the UK’s strategic interests are considered in any agreements.   1.  Memorandum of Understanding for the Belt and Road Initiative   While the UK and China are significant trade partners, and there are significant economic benefits that may arise from being part of the BRI, the UK has not signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU)25 with China to participate due to concerns about certain aspects of the BRI, notably debt sustainability,26 and concerns over whether China will maintain international standards and provide a “clear, transparent tendering process.”27 The UK believes that if these standards are met, it will “mitigate the risks of indebtedness, adverse social and environmental impacts, and unbalanced development.”28   A House of Commons committee agreed with the government’s decision to refrain from signing an MOU for the BRI, noting that the BRI “represents a foreign policy ambition with repercussions for other states, as well as both positive and negative implications for UK interests.”29 Specifically, the committee found:   [T]he Belt and Road Initiative, in the form it is currently being pursued, raises concerns regarding UK interests. These include the risk that Chinese investment will encourage countries to strike deals that undermine international standards that the UK seeks to promote, or that leave countries with unsustainable debt that undermines development and political stability. There is also a risk that the promise of Chinese investment, or the coercive leverage of indebtedness to China, could encourage countries to join China’s efforts to undermine certain aspects of the rules-based international system, and could weaken the alliances and partnerships that help preserve international peace and prosperity. We therefore commend the Government’s decision not to sign a Memorandum of Understanding in support of the Belt and Road Initiative on the basis of these risks. Further, the Government is right not to accede to China’s request for the UK to give what would be in effect a blanket endorsement of a key pillar of its foreign policy.30                                                    23 Id. at 14.   24 Id. 25 Countries of the Belt & Road Initiative (BRI), Green Belt & Road Initiative Ctr., https://perma.cc/7LNG-WQVE.  26 House of Commons Foreign Aff.

The FC[D]O’s role in providing such strategic context and advice on BRI projects should be explicitly acknowledged in the UK’s China strategy.”34   The committee ultimately concluded, in line with government policy, that “Chinese-led investment in foreign countries, and particularly developing countries, need not inherently conflict with British interests.”35 It further recommended that the government assess any BRI projects on a case-by-case basis and “refrain from expressing an overarching view on the merits of the initiative as a whole.”36 The FCDO has stated, “[o]ur intention remains to work with China in ways which support mutual and global benefits, fully in line with the international rules based system.”37    The UK has expressed concern over the impact Chinese investment has in areas that it considers to be fragile or those that are affected by conflict. The UK had to adapt its policy in response to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, which was initially presented by the Department for International Trade as a “huge opportunities for Pakistan and the wider region, bringing economic development, greater connectivity and regional security.”38 In contrast, the FCDO stated that it “does not support commercial projects in disputed territories.”39    2.  Belt and Road Initiative Strategic Oversight Board  The Belt and Road Initiative Strategic Oversight Board was established in 2017.40 The board has cross-party membership and is led by the head of the China Department at the FCDO.

This applies to both engagement with specific BRI projects and to HMG activities intended to influence BRI at a more systemic level, such as engagement with Chinese banks and State Owned-Enterprises. The Board ensures that proposed BRI-related activities can be considered on a case-by-case basis and that advice to Ministers on HMG engagement can take full account of UK interests, the broader strategic projects, and whether projects will contribute to sustainable prosperity outcomes.44  As is normal practice for internal government meetings, minutes are not published, and we have been unable to locate further information about the work of this board.45   3.  Financial Assistance  While development cooperation with China is controversial, the UK continues to consider China a developing country, and the UK is thus able to provide it with official development assistance (ODA),46 although this ODA occurs in government departments outside of the Department for International Development, as its focus is to reduce poverty.47 The UK is using both ODA-funded and non-ODA activity to engage with the BRI, with both “aim[ing] to maximise the development benefits and minimise the risks of this initiative.”48 Notably:  UK government departments have used between £2 million and £3 million [approximately US$2.8 million and USD$4.1 million respectively] annually to engage Chinese actors on infrastructure standards. This spending has supported the Prosperity Fund in implementing a pilot project in Kenya, which is promoting the application of ESG standards to a road construction project involving Chinese and Kenyan companies, and in training Chinese infrastructure companies and researching their practices in relation to                                                  41 House of Commons Foreign Aff.

UK Export Finance  The government is encouraging UK companies to engage in the BRI through the Department for International Trade, which is providing financial backing from UK Export Finance with £25 billion (approximately US$35 billion) worth of export support available for UK companies, along with a variety of other export support measures.50 During the 10th UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue, UK Finance signed a memorandum of cooperation with the Export-Import Bank of China to help support Chinese and UK exports in third-party markets. This was welcomed by both countries during the dialogue, and “China welcome[d] UK financial institutions to actively participate in the Belt and Road Inter-bank Regular Cooperation Mechanism initiated by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, and enhance third market cooperation under this framework.”51   B.  Government-Led Agreements   The UK has been the impetus behind a number of agreements with China, and, while not being a signatory to the BRI itself, the UK has signed MOUs that address other areas. Some of these agreements are discussed briefly below.   1.  MOU on Infrastructure Cooperation  In 2019, the Department for International Trade and the National Development and Reform Commission of the People’s Republic of China signed an MOU on infrastructure cooperation in third-country markets between UK and Chinese companies.52 This MOU is a technical agreement that facilitates cooperation between UK and Chinese firms on overseas projects to ensure they are “delivered in line with the highest economic, environmental, social and financial standards in order to deliver sustainable and inclusive development outcomes and deliver real opportunities for UK and international businesses.”53 The MOU aims to “facilitate market-led cooperation in third markets in line with G20 Principles for Quality Infrastructure Investment and the Debt Sustainability Framework for Participating Countries of the Belt and Road Initiative.”54                                                     49 Id. ¶ 5.11. 50 UK Businesses Urged to Benefit from Belt and Road Opportunities, supra note 2.   51 Policy Paper UK-China 10th Economic and Financial Dialogue: Policy Outcomes, HM Treasury (Sept. 2019), https://perma.cc/TQ72-3EP5.  52 Indep.

Belt and Road Financing Guiding Principle  The UK and China have both agreed to implement the Belt and Road Financing Guiding Principle. This aims to “promote cooperation on investment and financing under the Belt and Road Initiative.”55  3.  UK-China Green Finance Centre  The UK government supports the UK-China Green Finance Centre (UKCGFC), which aims to “enhance UK and China green finance cooperation to accelerate the global transition to an environmentally sustainable future.”56 The UKCGFC intends to achieve this aim by providing leadership on green finance and investment and connecting UK and Chinese firms to green finance and investment opportunities. It also is advocating for regulatory reform to allow for further green financing in both the UK and China.57  4.  Green Investment Principles  The City of London Corporation established a Greening the Belt and Road Investor Alliance (GBRIA)58 in 2017 to set green infrastructure standards for BRI projects. 59 Work by the GBRIA led to the launch of the Green Investment Principles,60 on to which financial service companies may sign. The Green Investment Principles are seven principles that aim to ensure low carbon, sustainable projects and minimize the environmental impact of these projects.  The GIP includes seven principles at three levels, i.e. strategy, operations, and innovation: Principle 1: Embedding sustainability into corporate governance Principle 2: Understanding Environmental, Social, and Governance Risks Principle 3: Disclosing environmental information Principle 4: Enhancing communication with stakeholders Principle 5: Utilizing green financial instruments Principle 6: Adopting green supply chain management Principle 7: Building capacity through collective action61                                                    55 Policy Outcomes of the 9th UK-China Economic and Financial Dialogue, gov.uk, https://perma.cc/P5SP-P92K.  56 About Us, UK-China Green Finance Ctr., https://perma.cc/26DT-JV87.   57 Id.  58 Belt and Road Initiative: Alliance, City of London, https://perma.cc/3AN7-32C8.  59 The Green Investment Principle (GIP) for the Belt and Road Initiative, Green Belt & Road Initiative Ctr., https://perma.cc/5FV5-WFGW.  60 Press Release, UK and Chinese Governments Welcome City Corporation Aspiration to Green Belt and Road, City of London (June 17, 2019), https://perma.cc/T22B-XXWG.  61 Green Belt & Road Initiative Ctr., supra note 58. \fBelt and Road Initiative: United Kingdom The Law Library of Congress 187 Signatories to the Green Investment Principles are “expected to incorporate the principles into their corporate strategy and decision-making processes and are invited to report regularly on their performance to the GIP Secretariat.”62 As of April 30, 2021, the Green Investment Principles had 39 signatory institutions from 14 countries.63  5.  10th UK and China Economic and Financial Dialogue   During the 10th UK and China Economic and Financial Dialogue, held in 2019, the two countries reaffirmed their commitment to “working together to strengthen their economic co-operation, boost bilateral trade and investment, and deepen financial links.”64 The two countries endorsed  the recommendations of the UK BRI Expert Board with plans to work towards the development of a BRI asset class by:  • Developing a new emerging markets infrastructure platform to consolidate and access a pipeline of bankable infrastructure projects; and  • Collaborating on a financing mechanism to crowd-in private finance.65   C.  Agreements with Private Companies  In January 2018, Standard Chartered Bank signed an MOU with the China Development Bank that is worth up to $1.6 billion over five years “to fund corporate finance projects and trade finance transactions linked to the BRI.”66   III.  Major Flagship Projects and Ongoing UK-China Relations    The UK has been engaging with China regarding sustainable financing of BRI projects, but there do not appear to be any major flagship projects. Engagement with China and the BRI has been occurring despite a deterioration in UK-China relations, which has been described by the government as a reset and by others as a breakdown.67 The deterioration has been attributed to a combination of factors. Concern over Chinese company Huawei’s involvement in the UK’s 5G cell phone network and over China’s treatment of Hong Kong, once a former UK territory for which the UK passed sovereignty to the Chinese in 1997. These issues, combined with frustrations over China’s lack of transparency during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the UK’s belief that China has been engaging in  human rights abuses in the Western Province of Xinjiang have been notable causes in the decline in relations.68                                                  62 Id.  63 Id. 64 Factsheet: 10th UK China Economic and Financial Dialogue, HM Treasury (June 17, 2019), https://perma.cc/2PY4-FGUR.  65 Id. 66 Indep.

Public Support/Criticisms   There has been a variety of reactions to the UK’s participation in the BRI. In evidence provided to a House of Commons committee, commentators expressed concern over the standards applying to BRI deals, noting that many fall short of international best practices and expressing concern that financers have failed to conduct proper risk assessments, leading to social and environmental costs. One example cited was the construction of pipelines that led to the forcible displacement of populations and the use of the military to protect investments.70 The Overseas Development Institute has expressed apprehension over the engagement of the BRI in fragile countries, claiming that it “could make fragile situations worse by failing to consider local conflict dynamics.”71  The UK’s approach to the BRI has been criticized for lacking in coherence and failing to complement the responses of other countries, such as the United States, and the EU and for not “rais[ing] awareness in recipient states of the possible risks associated with BRI projects.”72                                                   69 Id.  70 House of Commons Foreign Aff.

Introduction  This report, prepared by the research staff of the Law Library of Congress, provides a list of jurisdictions in the world where legislation that specifically refers to artificial intelligence (AI) or systems utilizing AI have been adopted or proposed. Researchers of the Law Library surveyed all jurisdictions in their research portfolios to find such legislation, and those encountered have been compiled in the annexed list with citations and brief descriptions of the relevant legislation. Only adopted or proposed instruments that have legal effect are reported for national and sub-national jurisdictions and the European Union (EU); guidance or policy documents that have no legal effect are not included for these jurisdictions.   Major international organizations have also been surveyed and documents adopted or proposed by these organizations that specifically refer to AI are reported in the list.  II.  Scope   The list only includes adopted or proposed legislation (and documents for international organizations) that specifically refers to AI. Binding decisions of regulatory agencies and relevant case law that specifically refers to AI are also included where encountered.   While various rules that do not specifically refer to AI in diverse areas of the law such as intellectual property, civil and administrative procedure, criminal law, and data protection and data security law are presumably applicable to the utilization of AI systems in the relevant regulated fields, the limitation of the scope of the list to specific references prevents the list from being overinclusive or underinclusive, given that the extent to which the legacy legal frameworks apply to novel uses of AI may not yet be sufficiently or clearly determined in many jurisdictions.  Nevertheless, the role of existing personal data protection frameworks in the regulation of processes utilizing AI appears to be particularly significant. Provisions governing automated decision making that are frequently incorporated in personal data protection laws are likely to be applicable in cases where AI systems are used to make decisions producing legal effects for individuals, although these provisions typically do not refer to AI specifically.   In the EU, article 22 of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) regulates automated decision making and profiling with regard to individuals. The GDPR is directly applicable and binding for all European Union member states; however, member states have adopted national legislation that is compliant with the GDPR that may include parallel provisions regarding automated decision making. Such national legislation, where the laws do not specifically refer to AI, are accordingly left out of the list. Only the GDPR itself, with its full citation and a brief description of its relevant article 22, is provided in the list’s entry for the European Union. \fRegulation of Artificial Intelligence Around the World: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 2 National personal data protection legislation that include provisions governing automated decision making in non-EU jurisdictions, such as data protection laws in Turkey or the United Kingdom, its territories, and British crown dependencies, are for the same reason left out of the list.  Also significant in this context is the Council of Europe (CoE) 1981 Convention for the Protection of Individuals with Regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data, which entered into force in 1985 and is the first international treaty on personal data protection. The convention and its proposed protocol, which has not entered into force yet, are also cited in the list.  III.  Findings  A.  National and Sub-National Jurisdictions  The survey found adopted legislation that specifically refers to AI in the following national and sub-national jurisdictions: Argentina, Belarus, China, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Lithuania, Macau, Mauritius, Norway, Peru, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, the Republic of Ireland, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, the Slovak Republic, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan.  Legislation referring to AI has been proposed and is at various stages of the legislative process in the following national jurisdictions: Argentina, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Israel, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines, South Korea, Thailand, and the United Kingdom.  The scope of the legislation that has been found in our survey varies greatly among jurisdictions. Some laws, for example, those adopted in Argentina, Belarus, Egypt, Iceland, Kazakhstan, Peru, Portugal, Qatar, the Republic of Ireland, the Russian Federation, Saudi Arabia, Serbia, Uzbekistan, and legislation proposed in Brazil, Chile, China, Colombia, Costa Rica, Israel, Mexico, Panama, the Philippines, Taiwan, and Thailand, provide for general frameworks, such as those governing the development and commercialization of AI systems, laying down ethics and fundamental rights principles applicable to development and utilization of AI, or establishing regulatory or advisory government bodies that will oversee the advances and proliferation of the technology.   Other laws govern specific applications of AI systems, for example, in regard to payment systems, employment-related decision making by public or private actors, self-driving road vehicles, illegal online content, text or image generation, and speech-signal processing. Such legislation has been enacted in jurisdictions such as China, Estonia, Greece, Hungary, Lithuania, Poland, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, and Uzbekistan, and it has been proposed in Kyrgyzstan. Some of these laws establish registration or licensing requirements for certain applications of AI, such as rules adopted in Greece and Mauritius, and a bill proposed in Canada.   Some jurisdictions have adopted laws that specifically relate to the use of decision making by public bodies and impose measures to ensure transparency and prevent bias, some of which require impact assessments to be filed for systems used by public administrators or the \fRegulation of Artificial Intelligence Around the World: Comparative Summary The Law Library of Congress 3 registration of systems. Such legislation is enacted, for example, in Greece, Finland, Norway, Spain, and Sweden, and it is proposed in Belgium. The survey also found legislation that relates to AI in other contexts, such as a law enacted in the United Kingdom that authorizes the government to intervene in acquisitions of companies developing AI that could harm the national security, a law enacted in Macau that provides tax benefits to companies engaging in AI-related innovation, and laws proposed in Chile that specifically criminalize use of AI in the commission of certain types of fraud.  B.  European Union and International Organizations  In the EU, a proposal for a regulation that incorporates transparency rules for low-risk AI systems and prohibitions and mandatory requirements for certain high-risk ones was introduced in 2021. In addition, last year, a directive establishing uniform rules for certain aspects of noncontractual civil liability for damage caused by AI systems was introduced. EU regulations are directly applicable in EU member states, whereas directives have to be transposed into national law.  With regard to international organizations, our survey found that documents specifically referring to AI have been adopted by the CoE, North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), OECD, and various bodies, organs, and specialized agencies of the United Nations (UN) such as UNESCO and the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).   In 2018, the CoE opened to signature a protocol to its 1981 Convention for the Protection of Individuals with regard to Automatic Processing of Personal Data that modernizes the convention and incorporates amendments establishing the right of an individual to have his or her views considered when being subjected to certain decisions based solely on automated processing of data. The protocol is not yet in force. Recently at the CoE, a proposal was made for a common framework convention for the design, development, and application of AI systems throughout their life cycle that would cover uses by both public or private actors, with the exclusion of uses related to national defense. This proposed framework convention takes a risk-based approach to AI systems, similar to the proposed EU regulation.  NATO adopted an Artificial Intelligence Strategy in 2021, laying down strategy points for NATO members and their allies and establishing principles of responsible use. Another NATO document establishes a Data and Artificial Intelligence Review Board responsible for the implementation of such principles.   The OECD adopted a Recommendation on AI that provides principles on responsible stewardship of AI and recommendations for their implementation.   Within the UN System, the UN Secretary-General issued a report providing a road map for implementing the recommendations of the High-level Panel on Digital Cooperation convened by the secretary-general, which refers to certain aspects of AI-related policymaking and governance. In 2021, UNESCO adopted a recommendation covering a selection of areas for policy action and including monitoring and evaluation standards. In 2022, the ITU published a report on the UN’s activities on AI.   \fThe Law Library of Congress 4 Jurisdictional Table   Jurisdiction References to AI in current legislation?

Examples are social benefits, voting, online, credit applications, or university admissions.  The proposed AI Act addresses the risks posed by AI systems to the safety or fundamental rights of citizens by following a risk-based approach ranging from complete prohibition or mandatory requirements for certain high-risk AI systems to transparency rules or voluntary compliance with the rules for low-risk AI systems. The AI Act as an EU regulation would be directly applicable in the EU member states once it enters into force, which is expected by the end of 2023.  The proposed AI Liability Directive would establish uniform rules for certain aspects of noncontractual civil liability for damage caused by AI systems, where such claims are brought under fault-based liability regimes. Among other things, it would regulate the burden of proof and disclosure of evidence, and it would create rebuttable presumptions of noncompliance and causation. As a directive, the AI Liability Directive would have to be transposed into national law by the EU Member States.

Weld†,‡†Allen Institute for Artiﬁcial Intelligence‡Paul G. Allen School of Computer Science & Engineering, University of Washington{armanc,sergey,beltagy,dougd,danw}@allenai.orgAbstractRepresentation learning is a critical ingre-dient for natural language processing sys-tems.Recent Transformer language mod-els like BERT learn powerful textual repre-sentations, but these models are targeted to-wards token- and sentence-level training ob-jectives and do not leverage information oninter-document relatedness, which limits theirdocument-level representation power. For ap-plications on scientiﬁc documents, such asclassiﬁcation and recommendation, the em-beddings power strong performance on endtasks. We propose SPECTER, a new method togenerate document-level embedding of scien-tiﬁc documents based on pretraining a Trans-former language model on a powerful signalof document-level relatedness:the citationgraph.Unlike existing pretrained languagemodels, SPECTER can be easily applied todownstream applications without task-speciﬁcﬁne-tuning. Additionally, to encourage furtherresearch on document-level models, we intro-duce SCIDOCS, a new evaluation benchmarkconsisting of seven document-level tasks rang-ing from citation prediction, to document clas-siﬁcation and recommendation. We show thatSPECTER outperforms a variety of competitivebaselines on the benchmark.11IntroductionAs the pace of scientiﬁc publication continues toincrease, Natural Language Processing (NLP) toolsthat help users to search, discover and understandthe scientiﬁc literature have become critical. In re-cent years, substantial improvements in NLP toolshave been brought about by pretrained neural lan-guage models (LMs) (Radford et al., 2018; Devlinet al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019). While such modelsare widely used for representing individual words∗Equal contribution1 https://github.com/allenai/specteror sentences, extensions to whole-document em-beddings are relatively underexplored. Likewise,methods that do use inter-document signals to pro-duce whole-document embeddings (Tu et al., 2017;Chen et al., 2019) have yet to incorporate state-of-the-art pretrained LMs. Here, we study how toleverage the power of pretrained language modelsto learn embeddings for scientiﬁc documents.A paper’s title and abstract provide rich seman-tic content about the paper, but, as we show inthis work, simply passing these textual ﬁelds to an“off-the-shelf” pretrained language model—even astate-of-the-art model tailored to scientiﬁc text likethe recent SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019)—doesnot result in accurate paper representations. Thelanguage modeling objectives used to pretrain themodel do not lead it to output representations thatare helpful for document-level tasks such as topicclassiﬁcation or recommendation.In this paper, we introduce a new method forlearning general-purpose vector representations ofscientiﬁc documents. Our system, SPECTER,2 in-corporates inter-document context into the Trans-former (Vaswani et al., 2017) language models(e.g., SciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019)) to learndocument representations that are effective acrossa wide-variety of downstream tasks, without theneed for any task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning of the pre-trained language model. We speciﬁcally use cita-tions as a naturally occurring, inter-document in-cidental supervision signal indicating which docu-ments are most related and formulate the signal intoa triplet-loss pretraining objective. Unlike manyprior works, at inference time, our model does notrequire any citation information. This is criticalfor embedding new papers that have not yet beencited. In experiments, we show that SPECTER’srepresentations substantially outperform the state-2SPECTER: Scientiﬁc Paper Embeddings using Citation-informed TransformERs\f2271of-the-art on a variety of document-level tasks, in-cluding topic classiﬁcation, citation prediction, andrecommendation.As an additional contribution of this work, we in-troduce and release SCIDOCS3 , a novel collectionof data sets and an evaluation suite for document-level embeddings in the scientiﬁc domain. SCI-DOCS covers seven tasks, and includes tens of thou-sands of examples of anonymized user signals ofdocument relatedness. We also release our trainingset (hundreds of thousands of paper titles, abstractsand citations), along with our trained embeddingmodel and its associated code base.2Model2.1OverviewOur goal is to learn task-independent representa-tions of academic papers. Inspired by the recentsuccess of pretrained Transformer language modelsacross various NLP tasks, we use the Transformermodel architecture as basis of encoding the inputpaper. Existing LMs such as BERT, however, areprimarily based on masked language modeling ob-jective, only considering intra-document contextand do not use any inter-document information.This limits their ability to learn optimal documentrepresentations. To learn high-quality document-level representations we propose using citations asan inter-document relatedness signal and formu-late it as a triplet loss learning objective. We thenpretrain the model on a large corpus of citationsusing this objective, encouraging it to output rep-resentations that are more similar for papers thatshare a citation link than for those that do not. Wecall our model SPECTER, which learns ScientiﬁcPaper Embeddings using Citation-informed Trans-formERs. With respect to the terminology used byDevlin et al. (2019), unlike most existing LMs thatare “ﬁne-tuning based”, our approach results in em-beddings that can be applied to downstream tasksin a “feature-based” fashion, meaning the learnedpaper embeddings can be easily used as features,with no need for further task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning.In the following, as background information, webrieﬂy describe how pretrained LMs can be appliedfor document representation and then discuss thedetails of SPECTER.3https://github.com/allenai/scidocsTransformer (initialized with SciBERT)Related paper (P+)Query paper (PQ)Unrelated paper (P−)Triplet loss =maxn\u0010d\u0000PQ, P+\u0001−d\u0000PQ, P−\u0001+ m\u0011, 0oFigure 1: Overview of SPECTER.2.2Background: Pretrained TransformersRecently, pretrained Transformer networks havedemonstrated success on various NLP tasks (Rad-ford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al.,2019; Liu et al., 2019); we use these models asthe foundation for SPECTER. Speciﬁcally, we useSciBERT (Beltagy et al., 2019) which is an adap-tation of the original BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)architecture to the scientiﬁc domain. The BERTmodel architecture (Devlin et al., 2019) uses multi-ple layers of Transformers (Vaswani et al., 2017) toencode the tokens in a given input sequence. Eachlayer consists of a self-attention sublayer followedby a feedforward sublayer. The ﬁnal hidden stateassociated with the special [CLS] token is usuallycalled the “pooled output”, and is commonly usedas an aggregate representation of the sequence.Document RepresentationOur goal is to repre-sent a given paper P as a dense vector v that bestrepresents the paper and can be used in downstreamtasks. SPECTER builds embeddings from the titleand abstract of a paper. Intuitively, we would ex-pect these ﬁelds to be sufﬁcient to produce accurateembeddings, since they are written to provide a suc-cinct and comprehensive summary of the paper.4As such, we encode the concatenated title and ab-stract using a Transformer LM (e.g., SciBERT) andtake the ﬁnal representation of the [CLS] token asthe output representation of the paper:5v = Transformer(input)[CLS],(1)where Transformer is the Transformer’s for-ward function, and input is the concatenation ofthe [CLS] token and WordPieces (Wu et al., 2016)of the title and abstract of a paper, separated by4We also experimented with additional ﬁelds such asvenues and authors but did not ﬁnd any empirical advantagein using those (see §6). See §7 for a discussion of using thefull text of the paper as input.5It is also possible to encode title and abstracts individuallyand then concatenate or combine them to get the ﬁnal embed-ding. However, in our experiments this resulted in sub-optimalperformance.\f2272the [SEP] token. We use SciBERT as our modelinitialization as it is optimized for scientiﬁc text,though our formulation is general and any Trans-former language model instead of SciBERT. Usingthe above method with an “off-the-shelf” SciBERTdoes not take global inter-document informationinto account. This is because SciBERT, like otherpretrained language models, is trained via languagemodeling objectives, which only predict words orsentences given their in-document, nearby textualcontext. In contrast, we propose to incorporate ci-tations into the model as a signal of inter-documentrelatedness, while still leveraging the model’s ex-isting strength in modeling language.2.3Citation-Based Pretraining ObjectiveA citation from one document to another suggeststhat the documents are related. To encode this relat-edness signal into our representations, we designa loss function that trains the Transformer modelto learn closer representations for papers when onecites the other, and more distant representationsotherwise. The high-level overview of the model isshown in Figure 1.In particular, each training instance is a triplet ofpapers: a query paper PQ, a positive paper P+ anda negative paper P−. The positive paper is a paperthat the query paper cites, and the negative paperis a paper that is not cited by the query paper (butthat may be cited by P+). We then train the modelusing the following triplet margin loss function:L = maxn\u0010d\u0000PQ, P+\u0001−d\u0000PQ, P−\u0001+ m\u0011, 0o(2)where d is a distance function and m is the lossmargin hyperparameter (we empirically choosem = 1). Here, we use the L2 norm distance:d(PA, PB) = ∥vA −vB∥2,where vA is the vector corresponding to the pooledoutput of the Transformer run on paper A (Equation1).6 Starting from the trained SciBERT model, wepretrain the Transformer parameters on the citationobjective to learn paper representations that capturedocument relatedness.2.4Selecting Negative DistractorsThe choice of negative example papers P−is im-portant when training the model. We consider twosets of negative examples: the ﬁrst set simply con-sists of randomly selected papers from the corpus.6We also experimented with other distance functions (e..g,normalized cosine), but they underperformed the L2 loss.Given a query paper, intuitively we would expectthe model to be able to distinguish between citedpapers, and uncited papers sampled randomly fromthe entire corpus. This inductive bias has beenalso found to be effective in content-based citationrecommendation applications (Bhagavatula et al.,2018). But, random negatives may be easy for themodel to distinguish from the positives. To providea more nuanced training signal, we augment therandomly drawn negatives with a more challengingsecond set of negative examples. We denote as“hard negatives” the papers that are not cited by thequery paper, but are cited by a paper cited by thequery paper, i.e. if P1cite−−→P2 and P2cite−−→P3but P1̸cite−−→P3, then P3 is a candidate hard nega-tive example for P1. We expect the hard negativesto be somewhat related to the query paper, but typi-cally less related than the cited papers. As we showin our experiments (§6), including hard negativesresults in more accurate embeddings compared tousing random negatives alone.2.5InferenceAt inference time, the model receives one paper, P,and it outputs the SPECTER’s Transfomer pooledoutput activation as the paper representation for P(Equation 1). We note that for inference, SPECTERrequires only the title and abstract of the giveninput paper; the model does not need any citationinformation about the input paper. This means thatSPECTER can produce embeddings even for newpapers that have yet to be cited, which is criticalfor applications that target recent scientiﬁc papers.3SCIDOCS Evaluation FrameworkPrevious evaluations of scientiﬁc document repre-sentations in the literature tend to focus on smalldatasets over a limited set of tasks, and extremelyhigh (99%+) AUC scores are already possible onthese data for English documents (Chen et al., 2019;Wang et al., 2019). New, larger and more diversebenchmark datasets are necessary. Here, we intro-duce a new comprehensive evaluation frameworkto measure the effectiveness of scientiﬁc paper em-beddings, which we call SCIDOCS. The frameworkconsists of diverse tasks, ranging from citation pre-diction, to prediction of user activity, to documentclassiﬁcation and paper recommendation. Note thatSPECTER will not be further ﬁne-tuned on any ofthe tasks; we simply plug in the embeddings as fea-tures for each task. Below, we describe each of the\f2273tasks in detail and the evaluation data associatedwith it. In addition to our training data, we releaseall the datasets associated with the evaluation tasks.3.1Document ClassiﬁcationAn important test of a document-level embedding iswhether it is predictive of the class of the document.Here, we consider two classiﬁcation tasks in thescientiﬁc domain:MeSH ClassiﬁcationIn this task, the goals is toclassify scientiﬁc papers according to their Medi-cal Subject Headings (MeSH) (Lipscomb, 2000).7We construct a dataset consisting of 23K academicmedical papers, where each paper is assigned oneof 11 top-level disease classes such as cardiovas-cular diseases, diabetes, digestive diseases derivedfrom the MeSH vocabulary. The most populatedcategory is Neoplasms (cancer) with 5.4K instances(23.3% of the total dataset) while the category withleast number of samples is Hepatitis (1.7% of thetotal dataset). We follow the approach of Feldmanet al. (2019) in mapping the MeSH vocabulary tothe disease classes.Paper Topic ClassiﬁcationThis task is predict-ing the topic associated with a paper using the pre-deﬁned topic categories of the Microsoft AcademicGraph (MAG) (Sinha et al., 2015)8. MAG pro-vides a database of papers, each tagged with a listof topics. The topics are organized in a hierarchyof 5 levels, where level 1 is the most general andlevel 5 is the most speciﬁc. For our evaluation,we derive a document classiﬁcation dataset fromthe level 1 topics, where a paper is labeled by itscorresponding level 1 MAG topic. We construct adataset of 25K papers, almost evenly split over the19 different classes of level 1 categories in MAG.3.2Citation PredictionAs argued above, citations are a key signal of re-latedness between papers. We test how well differ-ent paper representations can reproduce this signalthrough citation prediction tasks. In particular, wefocus on two sub-tasks: predicting direct citations,and predicting co-citations. We frame these asranking tasks and evaluate performance using MAPand nDCG, standard ranking metrics.7https://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/meshhome.html8https://academic.microsoft.com/Direct CitationsIn this task, the model is askedto predict which papers are cited by a given querypaper from a given set of candidate papers. Theevaluation dataset includes approximately 30K to-tal papers from a held-out pool of papers, con-sisting of 1K query papers and a candidate set ofup to 5 cited papers and 25 (randomly selected)uncited papers. The task is to rank the cited papershigher than the uncited papers. For each embed-ding method, we require only comparing the L2distance between the raw embeddings of the queryand the candidates, without any additional trainableparameters.Co-CitationsThis task is similar to the directcitations but instead of predicting a cited paper,the goal is to predict a highly co-cited paper witha given paper. Intuitively, if papers A and B arecited frequently together by several papers, thisshows that the papers are likely highly related anda good paper representation model should be ableto identify these papers from a given candidateset. The dataset consists of 30K total papers and isconstructed similar to the direct citations task.3.3User ActivityThe embeddings for similar papers should be closeto each other; we use user activity as a proxy foridentifying similar papers and test the model’s abil-ity to recover this information. Multiple users con-suming the same items as one another is a classicrelatedness signal and forms the foundation for rec-ommender systems and other applications (Schaferet al., 2007). In our case, we would expect thatwhen users look for academic papers, the papersthey view in a single browsing session tend to berelated. Thus, accurate paper embeddings should,all else being equal, be relatively more similar forpapers that are frequently viewed in the same ses-sion than for other papers. To build benchmarkdatasets to test embeddings on user activity, weobtained logs of user sessions from a major aca-demic search engine. We deﬁne the following twotasks on which we build benchmark datasets to testembeddings:Co-ViewsOur co-views dataset consists of ap-proximately 30K papers. To construct it, we take1K random papers that are not in our train or de-velopment set and associate with each one up to 5frequently co-viewed papers and 25 randomly se-lected papers (similar to the approach for citations).Then, we require the embedding model to rank the\f2274co-viewed papers higher than the random papersby comparing the L2 distances of raw embeddings.We evaluate performance using standard rankingmetrics, nDCG and MAP.Co-ReadsIf the user clicks to access the PDFof a paper from the paper description page, thisis a potentially stronger sign of interest in the pa-per. In such a case we assume the user will read atleast parts of the paper and refer to this as a “read”action. Accordingly, we deﬁne a “co-reads” taskand dataset analogous to the co-views dataset de-scribed above. This dataset is also approximately30K papers.3.4RecommendationIn the recommendation task, we evaluate the abil-ity of paper embeddings to boost performance ina production recommendation system. Our rec-ommendation task aims to help users navigate thescientiﬁc literature by ranking a set of “similar pa-pers” for a given paper. We use a dataset of userclickthrough data for this task which consists of22K clickthrough events from a public scholarlysearch engine. We partitioned the examples tem-porally into train (20K examples), validation (1K),and test (1K) sets. As is typical in clickthrough dataon ranked lists, the clicks are biased toward the topof original ranking presented to the user. To coun-teract this effect, we computed propensity scoresusing a swap experiment (Agarwal et al., 2019).The propensity scores give, for each position in theranked list, the relative frequency that the positionis over-represented in the data due to exposure bias.We can then compute de-biased evaluation metricsby dividing the score for each test example by thepropensity score for the clicked position. We reportpropensity-adjusted versions of the standard rank-ing metrics Precision@1 ( ˆP@1) and NormalizedDiscounted Cumulative Gain (ˆnDCG).We test different embeddings on the recommen-dation task by including cosine embedding dis-tance9 as a feature within an existing recommenda-tion system that includes several other informativefeatures (title/author similarity, reference and ci-tation overlap, etc.). Thus, the recommendationexperiments measure whether the embeddings canboost the performance of a strong baseline systemon an end task. For SPECTER, we also perform anonline A/B test to measure whether its advantages9Embeddings are L2 normalized and in this case cosinedistance is equivalent to L2 distance.on the ofﬂine dataset translate into improvementson the online recommendation task (§5).4ExperimentsTraining DataTo train our model, we use asubset of the Semantic Scholar corpus (Ammaret al., 2018) consisting of about 146K query papers(around 26.7M tokens) with their correspondingoutgoing citations, and we use an additional 32Kpapers for validation. For each query paper we con-struct up to 5 training triples comprised of a query,a positive, and a negative paper. The positive pa-pers are sampled from the direct citations of thequery, while negative papers are chosen either ran-domly or from citations of citations (as discussed in§2.4). We empirically found it helpful to use 2 hardnegatives (citations of citations) and 3 easy neg-atives (randomly selected papers) for each querypaper. This process results in about 684K trainingtriples and 145K validation triples.Training and ImplementationWe implementour model in AllenNLP (Gardner et al., 2018).We initialize the model from SciBERT pretrainedweights (Beltagy et al., 2019) since it is the state-of-the-art pretrained language model on scientiﬁctext. We continue training all model parameters onour training objective (Equation 2). We performminimal tuning of our model’s hyperparametersbased on the performance on the validation set,while baselines are extensively tuned. Based oninitial experiments, we use a margin m=1 for thetriplet loss. For training, we use the Adam opti-mizer (Kingma and Ba, 2014) following the sug-gested hyperparameters in Devlin et al. (2019) (LR:2e-5, Slanted Triangular LR scheduler10 (Howardand Ruder, 2018) with number of train steps equalto training instances and cut fraction of 0.1). Wetrain the model on a single Titan V GPU (12Gmemory) for 2 epochs, with batch size of 4 (themaximum that ﬁt in our GPU memory) and usegradient accumulation for an effective batch size of32. Each training epoch takes approximately 1-2days to complete on the full dataset. We releaseour code and data to facilitate reproducibility. 11Task-Speciﬁc Model DetailsFor the classiﬁca-tion tasks, we used a linear SVM where embed-ding vectors were the only features. The C hyper-parameter was tuned via a held-out validation set.10Learning rate linear warmup followed by linear decay.11https://github.com/allenai/specter\f2275For the recommendation tasks, we use a feed-forward ranking neural network that takes as inputten features designed to capture the similarity be-tween each query and candidate paper, includingthe cosine similarity between the query and candi-date embeddings and manually-designed featurescomputed from the papers’ citations, titles, authors,and publication dates.Baseline MethodsOur work falls into the inter-section of textual representation, citation mining,and graph learning, and we evaluate against state-of-the-art baselines from each of these areas. Wecompare with several strong textual models: SIF(Arora et al., 2017), a method for learning docu-ment representations by removing the ﬁrst prin-cipal component of aggregated word-level embed-dings which we pretrain on scientiﬁc text; SciBERT(Beltagy et al., 2019) a state-of-the-art pretrainedTransformer LM for scientiﬁc text; and Sent-BERT(Reimers and Gurevych, 2019), a model that usesnegative sampling to tune BERT for producing op-timal sentence embeddings. We also compare withCiteomatic (Bhagavatula et al., 2018), a closelyrelated paper representation model for citation pre-diction which trains content-based representationswith citation graph information via dynamicallysampled triplets, and SGC (Wu et al., 2019a), astate-of-the-art graph-convolutional approach. Forcompleteness, additional baselines are also in-cluded; due to space constraints we refer to Ap-pendix A for detailed discussion of all baselines.We tune hyperparameters of baselines to maximizeperformance on a separate validation set.5ResultsTable 1 presents the main results correspondingto our evaluation tasks (described in §3). Overall,we observe substantial improvements across alltasks with average performance of 80.0 across allmetrics on all tasks which is a 3.1 point absoluteimprovement over the next-best baseline. We nowdiscuss the results in detail.For document classiﬁcation, we report macroF1, a standard classiﬁcation metric. We observethat the classiﬁer performance when trained on ourrepresentations is better than when trained on anyother baseline. Particularly, on the MeSH (MAG)dataset, we obtain an 86.4 (82.0) F1 score which isabout a ∆= + 2.3 (+1.5) point absolute increaseover the best baseline on each dataset respectively.Our evaluation of the learned representations onpredicting user activity is shown in the “User activ-ity” columns of Table 1. SPECTER achieves a MAPscore of 83.8 on the co-view task, and 84.5 on co-read, improving over the best baseline (Citeomaticin this case) by 2.7 and 4.0 points, respectively.We observe similar trends for the “citation” and“co-citation” tasks, with our model outperformingvirtually all other baselines except for SGC, whichhas access to the citation graph at training and testtime.12 Note that methods like SGC cannot beused in real-world setting to embed new papersthat are not cited yet. On the other hand, on co-citation data our method is able to achieve the bestresults with nDCG of 94.8, improving over SGCwith 2.3 points. Citeomatic also performs well onthe citation tasks, as expected given that its primarydesign goal was citation prediction. Nevertheless,our method slightly outperforms Citeomatic on thedirect citation task, while substantially outperform-ing it on co-citations (+2.0 nDCG).Finally, for recommendation task, we observethat SPECTER outperforms all other models on thistask as well, with nDCG of 53.9. On the recom-mendations task, as opposed to previous experi-ments, the differences in method scores are gen-erally smaller. This is because for this task theembeddings are used along with several other in-formative features in the ranking model (describedunder task-speciﬁc models in §4), meaning that em-bedding variants have less opportunity for impacton overall performance.We also performed an online study to evaluatewhether SPECTER embeddings offer similar advan-tages in a live application. We performed an onlineA/B test comparing our SPECTER-based recom-mender to an existing production recommender sys-tem for similar papers that ranks papers by a textualsimilarity measure. In a dataset of 4,113 clicks, wefound that SPECTER ranker improved clickthroughrate over the baseline by 46.5%, demonstrating itssuperiority.We emphasize that our citation-based pretrain-ing objective is critical for the performance ofSPECTER; removing this and using a vanilla SciB-ERT results in decreased performance on all tasks.12For SGC, we remove development and test set citationsand co-citations during training. We also remove incomingcitations from development and test set queries as these wouldnot be available at test time in production.\f2276Task →ClassiﬁcationUser activity predictionCitation predictionRecomm.Avg.Subtask →MAGMeSHCo-ViewCo-ReadCiteCo-CiteModel ↓/ Metric →F1F1MAPnDCGMAPnDCGMAPnDCGMAPnDCGˆnDCGˆP@1Random4.89.425.251.625.651.925.151.524.951.451.316.832.5Doc2vec (2014)66.269.267.882.964.981.665.382.267.183.451.716.966.6Fasttext-sum (2017)78.184.176.587.975.387.474.688.177.889.652.518.074.1SIF (2017)78.481.479.489.478.288.979.490.580.890.953.419.575.9ELMo (2018)77.075.770.384.367.482.665.882.668.583.852.518.269.0Citeomatic (2018)67.175.781.190.280.590.286.394.184.492.852.517.376.0SGC (2019a)76.882.777.288.075.787.591.696.284.192.552.718.276.9SciBERT (2019)79.780.750.773.147.771.148.371.749.772.652.117.959.6Sent-BERT (2019)80.569.168.283.364.881.363.581.666.482.851.617.167.5SPECTER (Ours)82.086.483.691.584.592.488.394.988.194.853.920.080.0Table 1: Results on the SCIDOCS evaluation suite consisting of 7 tasks.6AnalysisIn this section, we analyze several design deci-sions in SPECTER, provide a visualization of itsembedding space, and experimentally compareSPECTER’s use of ﬁxed embeddings against a ﬁne-tuning approach.Ablation StudyWe start by analyzing howadding or removing metadata ﬁelds from the in-put to SPECTER alters performance. The resultsare shown in the top four rows of Table 2 (forbrevity, here we only report the average of the met-rics from each task). We observe that removingthe abstract from the textual input and relying onlyon the title results in a substantial decrease in per-formance. More surprisingly, adding authors as aninput (along with title and abstract) hurts perfor-mance.13 One possible explanation is that authornames are sparse in the corpus, making it difﬁcultfor the model to infer document-level relatednessfrom them. As another possible reason of this be-havior, tokenization using Wordpieces might besuboptimal for author names. Many author namesare out-of-vocabulary for SciBERT and thus, theymight be split into sub-words and shared acrossnames that are not semantically related, leadingto noisy correlation. Finally, we ﬁnd that addingvenues slightly decreases performance,14 excepton document classiﬁcation (which makes sense, aswe would expect venues to have high correlation13We experimented with both concatenating authors withthe title and abstract and also considering them as an additionalﬁeld. Neither were helpful.14Venue information in our data came directly from pub-lisher provided metadata and thus was not normalized.

The fact that SPECTER does notrequire inputs like authors or venues makes it appli-cable in situations where this metadata is not avail-able, such as matching reviewers with anonymizedsubmissions, or performing recommendations ofanonymized preprints (e.g., on OpenReview).One design decision in SPECTER is to use a set ofhard negative distractors in the citation-based ﬁne-tuning objective. The ﬁfth row of Table 2 showsthat this is important—using only easy negatives re-duces performance on all tasks. While there couldbe other potential ways to include hard negatives inthe model, our simple approach of including cita-tions of citations is effective. The sixth row of thetable shows that using a strong general-domain lan-guage model (BERT-Large) instead of SciBERT inSPECTER reduces performance considerably. Thisis reasonable because unlike BERT-Large, SciB-ERT is pretrained on scientiﬁc text.VisualizationFigure 2 shows t-SNE (van derMaaten, 2014) projections of our embeddings(SPECTER) compared with the SciBERT baseline\f2277(a) SPECTER(b) SciBERTFigure 2: t-SNE visualization of paper embeddings andtheir corresponding MAG topics.for a random set of papers.When comparingSPECTER embeddings with SciBERT, we observethat our embeddings are better at encoding topi-cal information, as the clusters seem to be morecompact. Further, we see some examples of cross-topic relatedness reﬂected in the embedding space(e.g., Engineering, Mathematics and ComputerScience are close to each other, while Businessand Economics are also close to each other). Toquantify the comparison of visualized embeddingsin Figure 2, we use the DBScan clustering algo-rithm (Ester et al., 1996) on this 2D projection.We use the completeness and homogeneity cluster-ing quality measures introduced by Rosenberg andHirschberg (2007). For the points corresponding toFigure 2, the homogeneity and completeness val-ues for SPECTER are respectively 0.41 and 0.72compared with SciBERT’s 0.19 and 0.63, a clearimprovement on separating topics using the pro-jected embeddings.Comparison with Task Speciﬁc Fine-TuningWhile the fact that SPECTER does not require ﬁne-tuning makes its paper embeddings less costly touse, often the best performance from pretrainedTransformers is obtained when the models are ﬁne-tuned directly on each end task. We experimentwith ﬁne-tuning SciBERT on our tasks, and ﬁndthis to be generally inferior to using our ﬁxed rep-resentations from SPECTER. Speciﬁcally, we ﬁne-tune SciBERT directly on task-speciﬁc signals in-stead of citations. To ﬁne-tune on task-speciﬁcdata (e.g., user activity), we used a dataset of co-views with 65K query papers, co-reads with 14Kquery papers, and co-citations (instead of directcitations) with 83K query papers. As the end tasksare ranking tasks, for all datasets we construct upto 5 triplets and ﬁne-tune the model using tripletranking loss.

We also includeboth easy and hard distractors as when trainingSPECTER (for hard negatives we choose the leastnon-zero co-viewed (co-read, or co-cited) papers).We also consider training jointly on all task-speciﬁctraining data sources in a multitask training process,where the model samples training triplets from adistribution over the sources. As illustrated in Ta-ble 3, without any additional ﬁnal task-speciﬁcﬁne-tuning, SPECTER still outperforms a SciBERTmodel ﬁne-tuned on the end tasks as well as theirmultitask combination, further demonstrating theeffectiveness and versatility of SPECTER embed-dings.157Related WorkRecent representation learning methods in NLPrely on training large neural language models on un-supervised data (Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al.,2018; Devlin et al., 2019; Beltagy et al., 2019; Liuet al., 2019). While successful at many sentence-and token-level tasks, our focus is on using themodels for document-level representation learning,which has remained relatively under-explored.There have been other efforts in document repre-sentation learning such as extensions of word vec-tors to documents (Le and Mikolov, 2014; Ganeshet al., 2016; Liu et al., 2017; Wu et al., 2018; Gy-sel et al., 2017), convolution-based methods (Liuet al., 2018; Zamani et al., 2018), and variationalautoencoders (Holmer and Marfurt, 2018; Wanget al., 2019). Relevant to document embedding, sen-tence embedding is a relatively well-studied area ofresearch. Successful approaches include seq2seqmodels (Kiros et al., 2015), BiLSTM Siamesenetworks (Williams et al., 2018), leveraging su-pervised data from other corpora (Conneau et al.,2017), and using discourse relations (Nie et al.,2019), and BERT-based methods (Reimers andGurevych, 2019). Unlike our proposed method,15We also experimented with further task-speciﬁc ﬁne-tuning of our SPECTER on the end tasks but we did not observeadditional improvements.\f2278the majority of these approaches do not considerany notion of inter-document relatedness when em-bedding documents.Other relevant work combines textual featureswith network structure (Tu et al., 2017; Zhang et al.,2018; Bhagavatula et al., 2018; Shen et al., 2018;Chen et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2019). These workstypically do not leverage the recent pretrained con-textual representations and with a few exceptionssuch as the recent work by Wang et al. (2019), theycannot generalize to unseen documents like ourSPECTER approach. Context-based citation rec-ommendation is another related application wheremodels rely on citation contexts (Jeong et al., 2019)to make predictions. These works are orthogonalto ours as the input to our model is just paper titleand abstract. Another related line of work is graph-based representation learning methods (Bruna et al.,2014; Kipf and Welling, 2017; Hamilton et al.,2017a,b; Wu et al., 2019a,b). Here, we compare toa graph representation learning model, SGC (Sim-ple Graph Convolution) (Wu et al., 2019a), whichis a state-of-the-art graph convolution approach forrepresentation learning. SPECTER uses pretrainedlanguage models in combination with graph-basedcitation signals, which enables it to outperform thegraph-based approaches in our experiments.SPECTER embeddings are based on only the titleand abstract of the paper. Adding the full text of thepaper would provide a more complete picture of thepaper’s content and could improve accuracy (Co-hen et al., 2010; Lin, 2008; Schuemie et al., 2004).However, the full text of many academic papersis not freely available. Further, modern languagemodels have strict memory limits on input size,which means new techniques would be required inorder to leverage the entirety of the paper withinthe models. Exploring how to use the full papertext within SPECTER is an item of future work.Finally, one pain point in academic paper rec-ommendation research has been a lack of publiclyavailable datasets (Chen and Lee, 2018; Kanakiaet al., 2019). To address this challenge, we re-lease SCIDOCS, our evaluation benchmark whichincludes an anonymized clickthrough dataset froman online recommendations system.8Conclusions and Future WorkWe present SPECTER, a model for learning repre-sentations of scientiﬁc papers, based on a Trans-former language model that is pretrained on cita-tions. We achieve substantial improvements overthe strongest of a wide variety of baselines, demon-strating the effectiveness of our model. We ad-ditionally introduce SCIDOCS, a new evaluationsuite consisting of seven document-level tasks andrelease the corresponding datasets to foster furtherresearch in this area.The landscape of Transformer language modelsis rapidly changing and newer and larger modelsare frequently introduced. It would be interest-ing to initialize our model weights from more re-cent Transformer models to investigate if additionalgains are possible. Another item of future work isto develop better multitask approaches to leveragemultiple signals of relatedness information duringtraining. We used citations to build triplets for ourloss function, however there are other metrics thathave good support from the bibliometrics literature(Klavans and Boyack, 2006) that warrant exploringas a way to create relatedness graphs. Includingother information such as outgoing citations as ad-ditional input to the model would be yet anotherarea to explore in future.AcknowledgementsWe thank Kyle Lo, Daniel King and Oren Etzionifor helpful research discussions, Russel Reas forsetting up the public API, Field Cady for help ininitial data collection and the anonymous reviewers(especially Reviewer 1) for comments and sugges-tions.

Random Zero-mean 25-dimensional vectorswere used as representations for each document.2. Doc2Vec Doc2Vec is one of the earlier neuraldocument/paragraph representation methods (Leand Mikolov, 2014), and is a natural comparison.We trained Doc2Vec on our training subset usingGensim ( ˇReh˚uˇrek and Sojka, 2010), and chose thehyperparameter grid using suggestions from Lauand Baldwin (2016).The hyperparameter gridused:{’window’: [5, 10, 15],’sample’: [0, 10 ** -6, 10 ** -5],’epochs’: [50, 100, 200]},for a total of 27 models. The other parameterswere set as follows:vector_size=300,min_count=3,alpha=0.025,min_alpha=0.0001, negative=5, dm=0,dbow=1, dbow_words=0.3. Fasttext-SumThissimplebaselineisaweighted sum of pretrained word vectors.Wetrained our own 300 dimensional fasttext embed-dings (Bojanowski et al., 2017) on a corpus ofaround 3.1B tokens from scientiﬁc papers whichis similar in size to the SciBERT corpus (Beltagyet al., 2019). We found that these pretrained embed-dings substantially outperform alternative off-the-shelf embeddings. We also use these embeddings inother baselines that require pretrained word vectors(i.e., SIF and SGC that are described below). Thesummed bag of words representation has a numberof weighting options, which are extensively tunedon a validation set for best performance.4. SIF The SIF method of Arora et al. (2017) isa strong text representation baseline that takes aweighted sum of pretrained word vectors (we usefasttext embeddings described above), then com-putes the ﬁrst principal component of the documentembedding matrix and subtracts out each documentembedding’s projection to the ﬁrst principal com-ponent.We used a held-out validation set to choose afrom the range [1.0e-5, 1.0e-3] spaced evenlyon a log scale. The word probability p(w) wasestimated on the training set only. When com-puting term-frequency values for SIF, we usedscikit-learn’s TﬁdfVectorizer with the same pa-rameters as enumerated in the preceding sec-tion.sublinear_tf, binary, use_idf,smooth_idf were all set to False. Since SIFis a sum of pretrained fasttext vectors, the resultingdimensionality is 300.5. ELMo ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) provides con-textualized representations of tokens in a document.It can provide paragraph or document embeddingsby averaging each token’s representation for all 3LSTM layers. We used the 768-dimensional pre-trained ELMo model in AllenNLP (Gardner et al.,2018).6. Citeomatic The most relevant baseline is Citeo-matic (Bhagavatula et al., 2018), which is an aca-demic paper representation model that is trained onthe citation graph via sampled triplets. Citeomaticrepresentations are an L2 normalized weighted sumof title and abstract embeddings, which are trainedon the citation graph with dynamic negative sam-pling. Citeomatic embeddings are 75-dimensional.7. SGC Since our algorithm is trained on data fromthe citation graph, we also compare to a state-of-the-art graph representation learning model: SGC(Simple Graph Convolution) (Wu et al., 2019a),which is a graph convolution network.An al-ternative comparison would have been Graph-SAGE (Hamilton et al., 2017b), but SGC (withno learning) outperformed an unsupervised variantof GraphSAGE on the Reddit dataset16, Note thatSGC with no learning boils down to graph prop-agation on node features (in our case nodes areacademic documents). Following Hamilton et al.(2017a), we used SIF features as node representa-tions, and applied SGC with a range of parameterk, which is the number of times the normalizedadjacency is multiplied by the SIF feature matrix.Our range of k was 1 through 8 (inclusive), and waschosen with a validation set. For the node features,we chose the SIF model with a = 0.0001, as thismodel was observed to be a high-performing one.This baseline is also 300 dimensional.8. SciBERTToisolatetheadvantageofSPECTER’s citation-based ﬁne-tuning objective,we add a controlled comparison with SciBERT(Beltagy et al., 2019).Following Devlin et al.(2019) we take the last layer hidden state corre-sponding to the [CLS] token as the aggregatedocument representation.1716There were no other direct comparisons in Wu et al.(2019a)17We also tried the alternative of averaging all token repre-sentations, but this resulted in a slight performance decreasecompared with the [CLS] pooled token.\f22829. Sentence BERT Sentence BERT (Reimers andGurevych, 2019) is a general-domain pretrainedmodel aimed at embedding sentences. The au-thors ﬁne-tuned BERT using a triplet loss, wherepositive sentences were from the same documentsection as the seed sentence, and distractor sen-tences came from other document sections. Themodel is designed to encode sentences as opposedto paragraphs, so we embed the title and each sen-tence in the abstract separately, sum the embed-dings, and L2 normalize the result to produce aﬁnal 768-dimensional paper embedding.18During hyperparameter optimization we chosehow to compute TF and IDF values weights bytaking the following non-redundant combinationsof scikit-learn’s TﬁdfVectorizer (Pedregosa et al.,2011) parameters: sublinear_tf, binary,use_idf, smooth_idf.There were a totalof 9 parameter combinations.The IDF valueswere estimated on the training set.The otherparameters were set as follows:min_df=3,max_df=0.75, strip_accents=’ascii’,stop_words=’english’,norm=None,lowercase=True. For training of fasttext, weused all default parameters with the exception ofsetting dimension to 300 and minCount was setto 25 due to the large corpus.18We used the ‘bert-base-wikipedia-sections-mean-tokens’model released by the authors: https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers",

Recentworks mainly perform soft bag-level noisereduction strategies to ﬁnd the relativelybetter samples in a sentence bag, which issuboptimal compared with making a harddecision of false positive samples in sen-tence level.In this paper, we introducean adversarial learning framework, whichwe named DSGAN, to learn a sentence-level true-positive generator. Inspired byGenerative Adversarial Networks, we re-gard the positive samples generated by thegenerator as the negative samples to trainthe discriminator. The optimal generator isobtained until the discrimination ability ofthe discriminator has the greatest decline.We adopt the generator to ﬁlter distant su-pervision training dataset and redistributethe false positive instances into the nega-tive set, in which way to provide a cleaneddataset for relation classiﬁcation. The ex-perimental results show that the proposedstrategy signiﬁcantly improves the perfor-mance of distant supervision relation ex-traction comparing to state-of-the-art sys-tems.1IntroductionRelation extraction is a crucial task in the ﬁeldof natural language processing (NLP). It has awide range of applications including informationretrieval, question answering, and knowledge basecompletion. The goal of relation extraction sys-tem is to predict relation between entity pair ina sentence (Zelenko et al., 2003; Bunescu andMooney, 2005; GuoDong et al., 2005). For exam-DS data spaceDS true positive dataDS false positive dataDS negative dataThe decision boundaryof DS dataThe desired decisionboundaryFigure 1: Illustration of the distant supervisiontraining data distribution for one relation type.ple, given a sentence “The [owl]e1 held the mousein its [claw]e2.”, a relation classiﬁer should ﬁgureout the relation Component-Whole between en-tity owl and claw.With the inﬁnite amount of facts in real world,it is extremely expensive, and almost impossiblefor human annotators to annotate training datasetto meet the needs of all walks of life. This prob-lem has received increasingly attention.Few-shot learning and Zero-shot Learning (Xian et al.,2017) try to predict the unseen classes with fewlabeled data or even without labeled data. Dif-ferently, distant supervision (Mintz et al., 2009;Hoffmann et al., 2011; Surdeanu et al., 2012) isto efﬁciently generate relational data from plaintext for unseen relations with distant supervision(DS). However, it naturally brings with some de-fects:the resulted distantly-supervised trainingsamples are often very noisy (shown in Figure 1),which is the main problem of impeding the per-formance (Roth et al., 2013).Most of the cur-rent state-of-the-art methods (Zeng et al., 2015;Lin et al., 2016) make the denoising operation inthe sentence bag of entity pair, and integrate thisprocess into the distant supervision relation ex-\f497traction. Indeed, these methods can ﬁlter a sub-stantial number of noise samples; However, theyoverlook the case that all sentences of an entitypair are false positive, which is also the commonphenomenon in distant supervision datasets. Un-der this consideration, an independent and accu-rate sentence-level noise reduction strategy is thebetter choice.In this paper, we design an adversarial learningprocess (Goodfellow et al., 2014; Radford et al.,2015) to obtain a sentence-level generator that canrecognize the true positive samples from the noisydistant supervision dataset without any supervisedinformation. In Figure 1, the existence of falsepositive samples makes the DS decision boundarysuboptimal, therefore hinders the performance ofrelation extraction. However, in terms of quan-tity, the true positive samples still occupy mostof the proportion; this is the prerequisite of ourmethod.Given the discriminator that possessesthe decision boundary of DS dataset (the browndecision boundary in Figure 1), the generator triesto generate true positive samples from DS posi-tive dataset; Then, we assign the generated sam-ples with negative label and the rest samples withpositive label to challenge the discriminator. Un-der this adversarial setting, if the generated sam-ple set includes more true positive samples andmore false positive samples are left in the rest set,the classiﬁcation ability of the discriminator willdrop faster. Empirically, we show that our methodhas brought consistent performance gains in vari-ous deep-neural-network-based models, achievingstrong performances on the widely used New YorkTimes dataset (Riedel et al., 2010). Our contribu-tions are three-fold:• We are the ﬁrst to consider adversarial learn-ing to denoise the distant supervision relationextraction dataset.• Our method is sentence-level and model-agnostic, so it can be used as a plug-and-playtechnique for any relation extractors.• We show that our method can generate acleaned dataset without any supervised infor-mation, in which way to boost the perfor-mance of recently proposed neural relationextractors.In Section 2, we outline some related works ondistant supervision relation extraction. Next, wedescribe our adversarial learning strategy in Sec-tion 3. In Section 4, we show the stability analysesof DSGAN and the empirical evaluation results.And ﬁnally, we conclude in Section 5.2Related WorkTo address the above-mentioned data sparsity is-sue, Mintz et al. (2009) ﬁrst align unlabeledtext corpus with Freebase by distant supervision.However, distant supervision inevitably suffersfrom the wrong labeling problem. Instead of ex-plicitly removing noisy instances, the early worksintend to suppress the noise. Riedel et al. (2010)adopt multi-instance single-label learning in rela-tion extraction; Hoffmann et al. (2011) and Sur-deanu et al. (2012) model distant supervision re-lation extraction as a multi-instance multi-labelproblem.Recently,somedeep-learning-basedmod-els (Zeng et al., 2014; Shen and Huang, 2016)have been proposed to solve relation extraction.Naturally, some works try to alleviate the wronglabeling problem with deep learning technique,and their denoising process is integrated into rela-tion extraction. Zeng et al. (2015) select one mostplausible sentence to represent the relation be-tween entity pairs, which inevitably misses somevaluable information.Lin et al. (2016) calculatea series of soft attention weights for all sentencesof one entity pair and the incorrect sentences canbe down-weighted; Base on the same idea, Ji et al.(2017) bring the useful entity information into thecalculation of the attention weights.However,compared to these soft attention weight assign-ment strategies, recognizing the true positivesamples from distant supervision dataset beforerelation extraction is a better choice. Takamatsuet al. (2012) build a noise-ﬁltering strategy basedon the linguistic features extracted from manyNLP tools, including NER and dependency tree,which inevitably suffers the error propagationproblem; while we just utilize word embeddingas the input information. In this work, we learna true-positive identiﬁer (the generator) which isindependent of the relation prediction of entitypairs, so it can be directly applied on top of anyexisting relation extraction classiﬁers. Then, weredistribute the false positive samples into thenegative set, in which way to make full use of thedistantly labeled resources.\f4983Adversarial Learning for DistantSupervisionIn this section, we introduce an adversarial learn-ing pipeline to obtain a robust generator which canautomatically discover the true positive samplesfrom the noisy distantly-supervised dataset with-out any supervised information. The overview ofour adversarial learning process is shown in Fig-ure 2. Given a set of distantly-labeled sentences,the generator tries to generate true positive sam-ples from it; But, these generated samples are re-garded as negative samples to train the discrimina-tor. Thus, when ﬁnishing scanning the DS positivedataset one time, the more true positive samplesthat the generator discovers, the sharper drop ofperformance the discriminator obtains. After ad-versarial training, we hope to obtain a robust gen-erator that is capable of forcing discriminator intomaximumly losing its classiﬁcation ability.In the following section, we describe the adver-sarial training pipeline between the generator andthe discriminator, including the pre-training strat-egy, objective functions and gradient calculation.Because the generator involves a discrete samplingstep, we introduce a policy gradient method to cal-culate gradients for the generator.3.1Pre-Training StrategyBoth the generator and the discriminator requirethe pre-training process, which is the common set-ting for GANs (Cai and Wang, 2017; Wang et al.,2017). With the better initial parameters, the ad-versarial learning is prone to convergence. As pre-sented in Figure 2, the discriminator is pre-trainedwith DS positive dataset P (label 1) and DS nega-tive set ND (label 0). After our adversarial learn-ing process, we desire a strong generator that can,to the maximum extent, collapse the discrimina-tor. Therefore, the more robust generator can beobtained via competing with the more robust dis-criminator. So we pre-train the discriminator un-til the accuracy reaches 90% or more. The pre-training of generator is similar to the discrimi-nator; however, for the negative dataset, we useanother completely different dataset NG, whichmakes sure the robustness of the experiment. Spe-cially, we let the generator overﬁts the DS posi-tive dataset P. The reason of this setting is thatwe hope the generator wrongly give high proba-bilities to all of the noisy DS positive samples atthe beginning of the training process. Then, alongwith our adversarial learning, the generator learnsto gradually decrease the probabilities of the falsepositive samples.3.2Generative Adversarial Training forDistant Supervision Relation ExtractionThe generator and the discriminator of DSGANare both modeled by simple CNN, because CNNperforms well in understanding sentence (Zenget al., 2014), and it has less parameters than RNN-based networks. For relation extraction, the inputinformation consists of the sentences and entitypairs; thus, as the common setting (Zeng et al.,2014; Nguyen and Grishman, 2015), we use bothword embedding and position embedding to con-vert input instances into continuous real-valuedvectors.What we desire the generator to do is to ac-curately recognize true positive samples. Unlikethe generator applied in computer vision ﬁeld (Imet al., 2016) that generates new image from theinput noise, our generator just needs to discovertrue positive samples from the noisy DS posi-tive dataset. Thus, it is to realize the “samplingfrom a probability distribution” process of the dis-crete GANs (Figure 2). For a input sentence sj,we deﬁne the probability of being true positivesample by generator as pG(sj).Similarly, fordiscriminator, the probability of being true pos-itive sample is represented as pD(sj).We de-ﬁne that one epoch means that one time scan-ning of the entire DS positive dataset.In or-der to obtain more feedbacks and make the train-ing process more efﬁcient, we split the DS posi-tive dataset P = {s1, s2, ..., sj, ...} into N bagsB = {B1, B2, ...BN}, and the network parame-ters θG, θD are updated when ﬁnishing processingone bag Bi1. Based on the notion of adversariallearning, we deﬁne the objectives of the generatorand the discriminator as follow, and they are al-ternatively trained towards their respective objec-tives.GeneratorSuppose that the generator producesa set of probability distribution {pG(sj)}j=1...|Bi|for a sentence bag Bi. Based on these probabili-ties, a set of sentence are sampled and we denotethis set as T.T = {sj}, sj ∼pG(sj), j = 1, 2, ..., |Bi|(1)1The bag here has the different deﬁnition from the sen-tence bag of an entity pair mentioned in the Section 1.\f499Epoch 𝑖Bag%&'Bag%Bag%('……DS PositiveDataset𝑠'𝑠*𝑠+… 𝑠-G…𝑝' = 0.57𝑝* = 0.02𝑝+ = 0.83𝑝7 = 0.26𝑝9 = 0.90Sampling𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙= 1𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙= 0D𝑟𝑒𝑤𝑎𝑟𝑑DS positivedatasetDS negativedataset𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙= 1𝑙𝑎𝑏𝑒𝑙= 0Pre-training𝑝- = 0.7High-confidencesamplesLoadParameterLow-confidencesamplesGeneratorDiscriminatorFigure 2:An overview of the DSGAN training pipeline. The generator (denoted by G) calculates theprobability distribution over a bag of DS positive samples, and then samples according to this probabilitydistribution. The high-conﬁdence samples generated by G are regarded as true positive samples. The dis-criminator (denoted by D) receives these high-conﬁdence samples but regards them as negative samples;conversely, the low-conﬁdence samples are still treated as positive samples. For the generated samples,G maximizes the probability of being true positive; on the contrary, D minimizes this probability.This generated dataset T consists of the high-conﬁdence sentences, and is regard as true posi-tive samples by the current generator; however, itwill be treated as the negative samples to train thediscriminator. In order to challenge the discrimi-nator, the objective of the generator can be formu-lated as maximizing the following probabilities ofthe generated dataset T:LG =Xsj∈Tlog pD(sj)(2)Because LG involves a discrete sampling step,so it cannot be directly optimized by gradient-based algorithm. We adopt a common approach:the policy-gradient-based reinforcement learning.The following section will give the detailed intro-duction of the setting of reinforcement learning.The parameters of the generator are continuallyupdated until reaching the convergence condition.DiscriminatorAfter the generator has gener-ated the sample subset T , the discriminator treatsthem as the negative samples; conversely, the restpart F = Bi−T is treated as positive samples. So,the objective of the discriminator can be formu-lated as minimizing the following cross-entropyloss function:(3)LD = −(Xsj∈(Bi−T)log pD(sj)+Xsj∈Tlog(1 −pD(sj)))The update of discriminator is identical to thecommon binary classiﬁcation problem. Naturally,it can be simply optimized by any gradient-basedalgorithm.What needs to be explained is that, unlikethe common setting of discriminator in previ-ous works, our discriminator loads the same pre-trained parameter set at the beginning of eachepoch as shown in Figure 2. There are two rea-sons. First, at the end of our adversarial training,what we need is a robust generator rather than adiscriminator. Second, our generator is to sampledata rather than generate new data from scratch;Therefore, the discriminator is relatively easy to becollapsed. So we design this new adversarial strat-egy: the robustest generator is yielded when thediscriminator has the largest drop of performancein one epoch. In order to create the equal con-dition, the bag set B for each epoch is identical,including the sequence and the sentences in each\f500Algorithm 1 The DSGAN algorithm.Data: DS positive set P, DS negative set NG for generator G, DS negative set ND for discriminator DInput: Pre-trained G with parameters θG on dataset (P, NG); Pre-trained D with parameters θD ondataset (P, ND)Output: Adversarially trained generator G1: Load parameters θG for G2: Split P into the bag sequence P = {B1, B2, ..., Bi, ..., BN}3: repeat4:Load parameters θD for D5:GG ←0, GD ←06:for Bi ∈P, i = 1 to N do7:Compute the probability pG(sj) for each sentence sj in Bi8:Obtain the generated part T by sampling according to {pG(sj)}j=1...|B| and the rest set F =Bi −T9:GD ←−1|P|{▽θDPT log(1 −pD(sj)) + ▽θDPF log pD(sj)}10:θD ←θD −αDGD11:Calculate the reward r12:GG ←1|T|PT r▽θG log pG(sj)13:θG ←θG + αGGG14:end for15:Compute the accuracy ACCD on ND with the current θD16: until ACCD no longer drops17: Save θGbag Bi.Optimizing GeneratorThe objective of thegenerator is similar to the objective of the one-stepreinforcement learning problem: Maximizing theexpectation of a given function of samples from aparametrized probability distribution. Therefore,we use a policy gradient strategy to update thegenerator. Corresponding to the terminology ofreinforcement learning, sj is the state and PG(sj)is the policy. In order to better reﬂect the qualityof the generator, we deﬁne the reward r from twoangles:• As the common setting in adversarial learn-ing, for the generated sample set, we hopethe conﬁdence of being positive samples bythe discriminator becomes higher. Therefore,the ﬁrst component of our reward is formu-lated as below:r1 = 1|T|Xsj∈TpD(sj) −b1(4)the function of b1 is to reduce variance duringreinforcement learning.• The second component is from the averageprediction probability of ND,˜p =1|ND|Xsj∈NDpD(sj)(5)ND participates the pre-training process ofthe discriminator, but not the adversarialtraining process. When the classiﬁcation ca-pacity of discriminator declines, the accuracyof being predicted as negative sample on NDgradually drops; thus, ˜p increases. In otherwords, the generator becomes better. There-fore, for epoch k, after processing the bag Bi,reward r2 is calculated as below,r2 = η(˜pki −b2)where b2 =max{˜pmi }, m=1..., k−1(6)b2 has the same function as b1.The gradient of LG can be formulated as below:▽θDLG =Xsj∈BiEsj∼pG(sj)r▽θG log pG(sj)= 1|T|Xsj∈Tr▽θG log pG(sj)(7)\f5013.3Cleaning Noisy Dataset with GeneratorAfter our adversarial learning process, we obtainone generator for one relation type; These genera-tors possess the capability of generating true pos-itive samples for the corresponding relation type.Thus, we can adopt the generator to ﬁlter the noisesamples from distant supervision dataset. Simplyand clearly, we utilize the generator as a binaryclassiﬁer. In order to reach the maximum utiliza-tion of data, we develop a strategy: for an en-tity pair with a set of annotated sentences, if allof these sentences are determined as false nega-tive by our generator, this entity pair will be redis-tributed into the negative set. Under this strategy,the scale of distant supervision training set keepsunchanged.4ExperimentsThis paper proposes an adversarial learning strat-egy to detect true positive samples from the noisydistant supervision dataset.Due to the absenceof supervised information, we deﬁne a genera-tor to heuristically learn to recognize true posi-tive samples through competing with a discrim-inator. Therefore, our experiments are intendedto demonstrate that our DSGAN method possessthis capability. To this end, we ﬁrst brieﬂy intro-duce the dataset and the evaluation metrics. Em-pirically, the adversarial learning process, to someextent, has instability; Therefore, we next illus-trate the convergence of our adversarial trainingprocess.Finally, we demonstrate the efﬁciencyof our generator from two angles: the quality ofthe generated samples and the performance on thewidely-used distant supervision relation extractiontask.4.1Evaluation and Implementation DetailsThe Reidel dataset2 (Riedel et al., 2010) is acommonly-used distant supervision relation ex-traction dataset.Freebase is a huge knowledgebase including billions of triples: the entity pairand the speciﬁc relationship between them. Giventhese triples, the sentences of each entity pair areselected from the New York Times corpus(NYT).Entity mentions of NYT corpus are recognized bythe Stanford named entity recognizer (Finkel et al.,2005). There are 52 actual relationships and a spe-cial relation NA which indicates there is no rela-tion between head and tail entities. Entity pairs of2http://iesl.cs.umass.edu/riedel/ecml/HyperparameterValueCNN Window cw, kernel size ck3, 100Word embedding de, |V |50, 114042Position embedding dp5Learning rate of G, D1e-5, 1e-4Table 1: Hyperparameter settings of the generatorand the discriminator.NA are deﬁned as the entity pairs that appear inthe same sentence but are not related according toFreebase.Due to the absence of the corresponding labeleddataset, there is not a ground-truth test dataset toevaluate the performance of distant supervision re-lation extraction system. Under this circumstance,the previous work adopt the held-out evaluationto evaluate their systems, which can provide anapproximate measure of precision without requir-ing costly human evaluation. It builds a test setwhere entity pairs are also extracted from Free-base. Similarly, relation facts that discovered fromtest articles are automatically compared with thosein Freebase. CNN is widely used in relation clas-siﬁcation (Santos et al., 2015; Qin et al., 2017),thus the generator and the discriminator are bothmodeled as a simple CNN with the window sizecw and the kernel size ck. Word embedding is di-rectly from the released word embedding matrixby Lin et al. (2016)3. Position embedding has thesame setting with the previous works: the maxi-mum distance of -30 and 30. Some detailed hy-perparameter settings are displayed in Table 1.4.2Training Process of DSGANBecause adversarial learning is widely regardedas an effective but unstable technique,herewe illustrate some property changes during thetraining process, in which way to indicate thelearning trend of our proposed approach.Weuse 3 relation types as the examples:/busi-ness/person/company, /people/person/place livedand/location/neighborhood/neighborhood of.Because they are from three major classes (bussi-ness, people, location) of Reidel dataset and theyall have enough distant-supervised instances.The ﬁrst row in Figure 3 shows the classiﬁcationability change of the discriminator during training.The accuracy is calculated from the negative setND.

The ﬁgures in the ﬁrst row present the performance change on ND insome speciﬁc epochs during processing the B = {B1, B2, ...BN}. Each curve stands for one epoch;The color of curves become darker as long as the epoch goes on. Because the discriminator reloadsthe pre-trained parameters at the beginning of each epoch, all curves start from the same point for eachrelation type; Along with the adversarial training, the generator gradually collapses the discriminator.The ﬁgures in the second row reﬂect the performance of generators from the view of the difﬁculty levelof training with the positive datasets that are generated by different strategies. Based on the noisy DSpositive dataset P, DSGAN represents that the cleaned positive dataset is generated by our DSGANgenerator; Random means that the positive set is randomly selected from P; Pre-training denotes thatthe dataset is selected according to the prediction probability of the pre-trained generator. These threenew positive datasets are in the same size.discriminator performs well on ND; moreover,ND is not used during adversarial training.Therefore, the accuracy on ND is the criterionto reﬂect the performance of the discriminator.In the early epochs, the generated samples fromthe generator increases the accuracy, because ithas not possessed the ability of challenging thediscriminator; however, as the training epochincreases,this accuracy gradually decreases,which means the discriminator becomes weaker.It is because the generator gradually learn togenerate more accurate true positive samples ineach bag. After the proposed adversarial learningprocess, the generator is strong enough to collapsethe discriminator. Figure 4 gives more intuitivedisplay of the trend of accuracy. Note that thereis a critical point of the decline of accuracy foreach presented relation types. It is because thatthe chance we give the generator to challengethe discriminator is just one time scanning ofthe noisy dataset; this critical point is yieldedwhen the generator has already been robustenough. Thus, we stop the training process whenthe model reaches this critical point.To sumup, the capability of our generator can steadilyincreases, which indicates that DSGAN is a robustadversarial learning strategy.4.3Quality of GeneratorDue to the absence of supervised information, wevalidate the quality of the generator from anotherangle.Combining with Figure 1, for one rela-tion type, the true positive samples must have ev-idently higher relevance (the cluster of purple cir-cles).Therefore, a positive set with more truepositive samples is easier to be trained; In otherwords, the convergence speed is faster and the ﬁt-ting degree on training set is higher.Based onthis , we present the comparison tests in the sec-ond row of Figure 3.We build three positive\f5030.50.550.60.650.70.750.80.850.90.9511.0551525354555657585AccuracyEpoch/business/person/company/people/person/place_lived/location/neighborhood/neighborhood_ofFigure 4: The performance change of the discrim-inator on ND during the training process.

We stop thetraining process when this accuracy no longer de-creases.datasets from the noisy distant supervision datasetP: the randomly-selected positive set, the positiveset base on the pre-trained generator and the pos-itive set base on the DSGAN generator. For thepre-trained generator, the positive set is selectedaccording to the probability of being positive fromhigh to low. These three sets have the same sizeand are accompanied by the same negative set.Obviously, the positive set from the DSGAN gen-erator yields the best performance, which indicatesthat our adversarial learning process is able to pro-duce a robust true-positive generator. In addition,the pre-trained generator also has a good perfor-mance; however, compared with the DSGAN gen-erator, it cannot provide the boundary between thefalse positives and the true positives.4.4Performance on Distant SupervisionRelation ExtractionBased on the proposed adversarial learning pro-cess, we obtain a generator that can recognize thetrue positive samples from the noisy distant super-vision dataset. Naturally, the improvement of dis-tant supervision relation extraction can provide aintuitive evaluation of our generator. We adopt thestrategy mentioned in Section 3.3 to relocate thedataset. After obtaining this redistributed dataset,we apply it to train the recent state-of-the-art mod-els and observe whether it brings further improve-ment for these systems. Zeng et al. (2015) and Linet al. (2016) are both the robust models to solvewrong labeling problem of distant supervision re-lation extraction.According to the comparisondisplayed in Figure 5 and Figure 6, all four mod-00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.4Recall0.30.40.50.60.70.80.91PrecisionCNN+ONECNN+ONE+DSGANCNN+ATTCNN+ATT+DSGANFigure 5: Aggregate PR curves of CNN˙basedmodel.00.050.10.150.20.250.30.350.4Recall0.40.50.60.70.80.91PrecisionPCNN+ONEPCNN+ONE+DSGANPCNN+ATTPCNN+ATT+DSGANFigure 6: Aggregate PR curves of PCNN˙basedmodel.els (CNN+ONE, CNN+ATT, PCNN+ONE andPCNN+ATT) achieve further improvement.Even though Zeng et al. (2015) and Lin et al.(2016) are designed to alleviate the inﬂuence offalse positive samples, both of them merely focuson the noise ﬁltering in the sentence bag of en-tity pairs. Zeng et al. (2015) combine at-least-onemulti-instance learning with deep neural networkto extract only one active sentence to represent thetarget entity pair; Lin et al. (2016) assign soft at-tention weights to the representations of all sen-tences of one entity pair, then employ the weightedsum of these representations to predict the rela-tion between the target entity pair. However, fromour manual inspection of Riedel dataset (Riedelet al., 2010), we found another false positive casethat all the sentences of a speciﬁc entity pair arewrong; but the aforementioned methods overlook\f504Model-+DSGANp-valueCNN+ONE0.1770.1894.37e-04CNN+ATT0.2190.2268.36e-03PCNN+ONE0.2060.2212.89e-06PCNN+ATT0.2530.2642.34e-03Table 2:Comparison of AUC values betweenprevious studies and our DSGAN method. The p-value stands for the result of t-test evaluation.this case, while the proposed method can solve thisproblem. Our DSGAN pipeline is independent ofthe relation prediction of entity pairs, so we canadopt our generator as the true-positive indicatorto ﬁlter the noisy distant supervision dataset be-fore relation extraction, which explains the originof these further improvements in Figure 5 and Fig-ure 6. In order to give more intuitive compari-son, in Table 2, we present the AUC value of eachPR curve, which reﬂects the area size under thesecurves. The larger value of AUC reﬂects the betterperformance. Also, as can be seen from the resultof t-test evaluation, all the p-values are less than5e-02, so the improvements are obvious.5ConclusionDistant supervision has become a standard methodin relation extraction. However, while it bringsthe convenience, it also introduces noise in dis-tantly labeled sentences. In this work, we proposethe ﬁrst generative adversarial training methodfor robust distant supervision relation extraction.More speciﬁcally, our framework has two com-ponents: a generator that generates true positives,and a discriminator that tries to classify positiveand negative data samples. With adversarial train-ing, our goal is to gradually decrease the perfor-mance of the discriminator, while the generatorimproves the performance for predicting true pos-itives when reaching equilibrium. Our approachis model-agnostic, and thus can be applied to anydistant supervision model. Empirically, we showthat our method can signiﬁcantly improve the per-formances of many competitive baselines on thewidely used New York Time dataset.AcknowledgeThis work was supported by National Natural Sci-ence Foundation of China (61702047), BeijingNatural Science Foundation (4174098), the Fun-damental Research Funds for the Central Univer-sities (2017RC02) and National Natural ScienceFoundation of China (61703234)ReferencesRazvan Bunescu and Raymond J Mooney. 2005.

LiptonCarnegie Mellon UniversityPittsburgh, USA{ddanish, bdhingra}@cs.cmu.edu, zlipton@cmu.eduAbstractTo combat adversarial spelling mistakes, wepropose placing a word recognition model infront of the downstream classiﬁer. Our wordrecognition models build upon the RNN semi-character architecture, introducing several newbackoff strategies for handling rare and un-seen words. Trained to recognize words cor-rupted by random adds, drops, swaps, andkeyboard mistakes, our method achieves 32%relative (and 3.3% absolute) error reductionover the vanilla semi-character model.No-tably, our pipeline confers robustness on thedownstream classiﬁer, outperforming both ad-versarial training and off-the-shelf spell check-ers. Against a BERT model ﬁne-tuned for sen-timent analysis, a single adversarially-chosencharacter attack lowers accuracy from 90.3%to 45.8%. Our defense restores accuracy to75%1. Surprisingly, better word recognitiondoes not always entail greater robustness. Ouranalysis reveals that robustness also dependsupon a quantity that we denote the sensitivity.1IntroductionDespite the rapid progress of deep learning tech-niques on diverse supervised learning tasks, thesemodels remain brittle to subtle shifts in the datadistribution. Even when the permissible changesare conﬁned to barely-perceptible perturbations,training robust models remains an open challenge.Following the discovery that imperceptible attackscould cause image recognition models to misclas-sify examples (Szegedy et al., 2013), a veritablesub-ﬁeld has emerged in which authors iterativelypropose attacks and countermeasures.For all the interest in adversarial computer vi-sion, these attacks are rarely encountered out-side of academic research. However, adversarial1All code for our defenses, attacks, and baselines isavailable at https://github.com/danishpruthi/Adversarial-MisspellingsAlterationMovie ReviewLabelOriginalA triumph, relentless and beautifulin its downbeat darkness+SwapA triumph, relentless and beuatifulin its downbeat darkness–DropA triumph, relentless and beautifulin its dwnbeat darkness–+ DefenseA triumph, relentless and beautifulin its downbeat darkness++ DefenseA triumph, relentless and beautifulin its downbeat darkness+Table 1: Adversarial spelling mistakes inducing senti-ment misclassiﬁcation and word-recognition defenses.misspellings constitute a longstanding real-worldproblem. Spammers continually bombard emailservers, subtly misspelling words in efforts toevade spam detection while preserving the emails’intended meaning (Lee and Ng, 2005; Fumeraet al., 2006). As another example, programmaticcensorship on the Internet has spurred communi-ties to adopt similar methods to communicate sur-reptitiously (Bitso et al., 2013).In this paper, we focus on adversarially-chosenspelling mistakes in the context of text classiﬁca-tion, addressing the following attack types: drop-ping, adding, and swapping internal characterswithin words. These perturbations are inspired bypsycholinguistic studies (Rawlinson, 1976; MattDavis, 2003) which demonstrated that humans cancomprehend text altered by jumbling internal char-acters, provided that the ﬁrst and last characters ofeach word remain unperturbed.First, in experiments addressing both BiLSTMand ﬁne-tuned BERT models, comprising fourdifferent input formats:word-only, char-only,word+char, and word-piece (Wu et al., 2016), wedemonstrate that an adversary can degrade a clas-siﬁer’s performance to that achieved by randomguessing. This requires altering just two charac-\f5583ters per sentence. Such modiﬁcations might ﬂipwords either to a different word in the vocabu-lary or, more often, to the out-of-vocabulary to-ken UNK . Consequently, adversarial edits can de-grade a word-level model by transforming the in-formative words to UNK . Intuitively, one mightsuspect that word-piece and character-level mod-els would be less susceptible to spelling attacksas they can make use of the residual word con-text. However, our experiments demonstrate thatcharacter and word-piece models are in fact morevulnerable. We show that this is due to the ad-versary’s effective capacity for ﬁner grained ma-nipulations on these models.While against aword-level model, the adversary is mostly lim-ited to UNK -ing words, against a word-piece orcharacter-level model, each character-level add,drop, or swap produces a distinct input, providingthe adversary with a greater set of options.Second, we evaluate ﬁrst-line techniques in-cluding data augmentation and adversarial train-ing, demonstrating that they offer only marginalbeneﬁts here, e.g., a BERT model achieving 90.3accuracy on a sentiment classiﬁcation task, isdegraded to 64.1 by an adversarially-chosen 1-character swap in the sentence, which can only berestored to 69.2 by adversarial training.Third (our primary contribution), we proposea task-agnostic defense, attaching a word recog-nition model that predicts each word in a sen-tence given a full sequence of (possibly mispelled)inputs.The word recognition model’s outputscomprise the input to a downstream classiﬁcationmodel. Our word recognition models build uponthe RNN-based semi-character word recognitionmodel due to Sakaguchi et al. (2017). While ourword recognizers are trained on domain-speciﬁctext from the task at hand, they often predict UNKat test time, owing to the small domain-speciﬁcvocabulary. To handle unobserved and rare words,we propose several backoff strategies includingfalling back on a generic word recognizer trainedon a larger corpus.Incorporating our defenses,BERT models subject to 1-character attacks arerestored to 88.3, 81.1, 78.0 accuracy for swap,drop, add attacks respectively, as compared to69.2, 63.6, and 50.0 for adversarial trainingFourth, we offer a detailed qualitative analysis,demonstrating that a low word error rate alone isinsufﬁcient for a word recognizer to confer robust-ness on the downstream task.Additionally, weﬁnd that it is important that the recognition modelsupply few degrees of freedom to an attacker. Weprovide a metric to quantify this notion of sensi-tivity in word recognition models and study its re-lation to robustness empirically. Models with lowsensitivity and word error rate are most robust.2Related WorkSeveral papers address adversarial attacks on NLPsystems.Changes to text, whether word- orcharacter-level, are all perceptible, raising somequestions about what should rightly be consideredan adversarial example (Ebrahimi et al., 2018b;Belinkov and Bisk, 2018). Jia and Liang (2017)address the reading comprehension task, show-ing that by appending distractor sentences to theend of stories from the SQuAD dataset (Rajpurkaret al., 2016), they could cause models to output in-correct answers. Inspired by this work, Glockneret al. (2018) demonstrate an attack that breaks en-tailment systems by replacing a single word witheither a synonym or its hypernym. Recently, Zhaoet al. (2018) investigated the problem of producingnatural-seeming adversarial examples, noting thatadversarial examples in NLP are often ungram-matical (Li et al., 2016).In related work on character-level attacks,Ebrahimi et al. (2018b,a) explored gradient-basedmethods to generate string edits to fool classiﬁca-tion and translation systems, respectively. Whiletheir focus is on efﬁcient methods for generat-ing adversaries, ours is on improving the worstcase adversarial performance. Similarly, Belinkovand Bisk (2018) studied how synthetic and natu-ral noise affects character-level machine transla-tion. They considered structure invariant represen-tations and adversarial training as defenses againstsuch noise. Here, we show that an auxiliary wordrecognition model, which can be trained on unla-beled data, provides a strong defense.Spelling correction (Kukich, 1992) is oftenviewed as a sub-task of grammatical error correc-tion (Ng et al., 2014; Schmaltz et al., 2016). Clas-sic methods rely on a source language model and anoisy channel model to ﬁnd the most likely correc-tion for a given word (Mays et al., 1991; Brill andMoore, 2000). Recently, neural techniques havebeen applied to the task (Sakaguchi et al., 2017;Li et al., 2018), which model the context and or-thography of the input together. Our work extendsthe ScRNN model of Sakaguchi et al. (2017).\f55843Robust Word RecognitionTo tackle character-level adversarial attacks, weintroduce a simple two-stage solution, placing aword recognition model (W) before the down-stream classiﬁer (C). Under this scheme, all inputsare classiﬁed by the composed model C ◦W. Thismodular approach, with W and C trained sepa-rately, offers several beneﬁts: (i) we can deploy thesame word recognition model for multiple down-stream classiﬁcation tasks/models; and (ii) we cantrain the word recognition model with larger unla-beled corpora.Against adversarial mistakes, two importantfactors govern the robustness of this combinedmodel: W’s accuracy in recognizing misspelledwords and W’s sensitivity to adversarial perturba-tions on the same input. We discuss these aspectsin detail below.3.1ScRNN with BackoffWe now describe semi-character RNNs for wordrecognition, explain their limitations, and suggesttechniques to improve them.ScRNN ModelInspired by the psycholinguis-tic studies (Matt Davis, 2003; Rawlinson, 1976),Sakaguchi et al. (2017) proposed a semi-characterbased RNN (ScRNN) that processes a sentenceof words with misspelled characters, predict-ing the correct words at each step.Let s ={w1, w2, . . . , wn} denote the input sentence, a se-quence of constituent words wi. Each input word(wi) is represented by concatenating (i) a one hotvector of the ﬁrst character (wi1); (ii) a one hotrepresentation of the last character (wil, wherel is the length of word wi); and (iii) a bag ofcharacters representation of the internal characters(Pl−1j=2 wij). ScRNN treats the ﬁrst and the lastcharacters individually, and is agnostic to the or-dering of the internal characters. Each word, rep-resented accordingly, is then fed into a BiLSTMcell. At each sequence step, the training target isthe correct corresponding word (output dimensionequal to vocabulary size), and the model is opti-mized with cross-entropy loss.Backoff VariationsWhile Sakaguchi et al.(2017) demonstrate strong word recognition per-formance, a drawback of their evaluation setup isthat they only attack and evaluate on the subsetof words that are a part of their training vocabu-lary. In such a setting, the word recognition per-formance is unreasonably dependant on the cho-sen vocabulary size. In principle, one can designmodels to predict (correctly) only a few chosenwords, and ignore the remaining majority and stillreach 100% accuracy. For the adversarial setting,rare and unseen words in the wild are particularlycritical, as they provide opportunities for the at-tackers. A reliable word-recognizer should handlethese cases gracefully. Below, we explore differentways to back off when the ScRNN predicts UNK(a frequent outcome for rare and unseen words):• Pass-through:word-recognizer passes onthe (possibly misspelled) word as is.• Backoff to neutral word:Alternatively,noting that passingUNK -predicted wordsthrough unchanged exposes the downstreammodel to potentially corrupted text, we con-sider backing off to a neutral word like‘a’, which has a similar distribution acrossclasses.• Backoff to background model:We alsoconsider falling back upon a more genericword recognition model trained upon a larger,less-specialized corpus whenever the fore-ground word recognition model predictsUNK 2. Figure 1 depicts this scenario pic-torially.Empirically, we ﬁnd that the background model(by itself) is less accurate, because of the largenumber of words it is trained to predict. Thus,it is best to train a precise foreground model onan in-domain corpus and focus on frequent words,and then to resort to a general-purpose backgroundmodel for rare and unobserved words. Next, wedelineate our second consideration for building ro-bust word-recognizers.3.2Model SensitivityIn computer vision, an important factor determin-ing the success of an adversary is the norm con-straint on the perturbations allowed to an image(||x −x′||∞< ϵ).Higher values of ϵ lead toa higher chance of mis-classiﬁcation for at leastone x′. Defense methods such as quantization (Xuet al., 2017) and thermometer encoding (Buck-man et al., 2018) try to reduce the space of pertur-bations available to the adversary by making themodel invariant to small changes in the input.2Potentially the background model could be trained withfull vocabulary so that it never predicts UNK\f5585Figure 1: A schematic sketch of our proposed word recognition system, consisting of a foreground and a back-ground model. We train the foreground model on the smaller, domain-speciﬁc dataset, and the background modelon a larger dataset (e.g., the IMDB movie corpus). We train both models to reconstruct the correct word fromthe orthography and context of the individual words, using synthetically corrupted inputs during training. Subse-quently, we invoke the background model whenever the foreground model predicts UNK .In NLP, we often get such invariance for free,e.g., for a word-level model, most of the pertur-bations produced by our character-level adversarylead to an UNK at its input. If the model is robustto the presence of these UNK tokens, there is littleroom for an adversary to manipulate it. Character-level models, on the other hand, despite their supe-rior performance in many tasks, do not enjoy suchinvariance. This characteristic invariance could beexploited by an attacker. Thus, to limit the numberof different inputs to the classiﬁer, we wish to re-duce the number of distinct word recognition out-puts that an attacker can induce, not just the num-ber of words on which the model is “fooled”. Wedenote this property of a model as its sensitivity.We can quantify this notion for a word recogni-tion system W as the expected number of uniqueoutputs it assigns to a set of adversarial pertur-bations. Given a sentence s from the set of sen-tences S, let A(s) = s1′, s2′, . . . , sn′ denote theset of n perturbations to it under attack type A,and let V be the function that maps strings to aninput representation for the downstream classiﬁer.For a word level model, V would transform sen-tences to a sequence of word ids, mapping OOVwords to the same UNK ID. Whereas, for a char(or word+char, word-piece) model, V would mapinputs to a sequence of character IDs. Formally,sensitivity is deﬁned asSAW,V = Es\u0014#u(V ◦W(s1′), . . . , V ◦W(sn′))n\u0015,(1)where V ◦W(si) returns the input representation(of the downstream classiﬁer) for the output stringproduced by the word-recognizer W using si and#u(·) counts the number of unique arguments.Intuitively, we expect a high value of SAW,V tolead to a lower robustness of the downstream clas-siﬁer, since the adversary has more degrees offreedom to attack the classiﬁer. Thus, when usingword recognition as a defense, it is prudent to de-sign a low sensitivity system with a low error rate.However, as we will demonstrate, there is often atrade-off between sensitivity and error rate.3.3Synthesizing Adversarial AttacksSuppose we are given a classiﬁer C : S →Ywhich maps natural language sentences s ∈S toa label from a predeﬁned set y ∈Y. An adversaryfor this classiﬁer is a function A which maps a sen-tence s to its perturbed versions {s′1, s′2, . . . , s′n}such that each s′i is close to s under some notionof distance between sentences. We deﬁne the ro-bustness of classiﬁer C to the adversary A as:RC,A = Es\u0014mins′∈A(s) 1[C(s′) = y]\u0015,(2)where y represents the ground truth label for s. Inpractice, a real-world adversary may only be ableto query the classiﬁer a few times, hence RC,Arepresents the worst-case adversarial performanceof C. Methods for generating adversarial exam-ples, such as HotFlip (Ebrahimi et al., 2018b), fo-cus on efﬁcient algorithms for searching the min\f5586above. Improving RC,A would imply better ro-bustness against all these methods.Allowed Perturbations (A(s))We explore ad-versaries which perturb sentences with four typesof character-level edits: (1) Swap: swapping twoadjacent internal characters of a word. (2) Drop:removing an internal character of a word. (3) Key-board: substituting an internal character with ad-jacent characters of QWERTY keyboard (4) Add:inserting a new character internally in a word. Inline with the psycholinguistic studies (Matt Davis,2003; Rawlinson, 1976), to ensure that the pertur-bations do not affect human ability to comprehendthe sentence, we only allow the adversary to editthe internal characters of a word, and not edit stop-words or words shorter than 4 characters.Attack StrategyFor 1-character attacks, we tryall possible perturbations listed above until weﬁnd an adversary that ﬂips the model prediction.For 2-character attacks, we greedily ﬁx the editwhich had the least conﬁdence among 1-characterattacks, and then try all the allowed perturbationson the remaining words. Higher order attacks canbe performed in a similar manner.The greedystrategy reduces the computation required to ob-tain higher order attacks3, but also means that therobustness score is an upper bound on the true ro-bustness of the classiﬁer.4Experiments and ResultsIn this section, we ﬁrst discuss our experiments onthe word recognition systems.4.1Word Error CorrectionData: We evaluate the spell correctors from §3 onmovie reviews from the Stanford Sentiment Tree-bank (SST) (Socher et al., 2013). The SST datasetconsists of 8544 movie reviews, with a vocabu-lary of over 16K words. As a background cor-pus, we use the IMDB movie reviews (Maas et al.,2011), which contain 54K movie reviews, and avocabulary of over 78K words. The two datasetsdo not share any reviews in common. The spell-correction models are evaluated on their abilityto correct misspellings. The test setting consistsof reviews where each word (with length ≥4,barring stopwords) is attacked by one of the at-tack types (from swap, add, drop and keyboard at-3Its complexity is O(l), instead of O(lm) where l is thesentence length and m is the order.tacks). In the all attack setting, we mix all attacksby randomly choosing one for each word. Thismost closely resembles a real world attack setting.Experimental SetupIn addition to our wordrecognition models, we also compare to AfterThe Deadline (ATD), an open-source spell cor-rector4.We found ATD to be the best freely-available corrector5. We refer the reader to Sak-aguchi et al. (2017) for comparisons of ScRNN toother anonymized commercial spell checkers.For the ScRNN model, we use a single-layer Bi-LSTM with a hidden dimension size of 50. Theinput representation consists of 198 dimensions,which is thrice the number of unique characters(66) in the vocabulary.We cap the vocabularysize to 10K words, whereas we use the entire vo-cabulary of 78470 words when we backoff to thebackground model. For training these networks,we corrupt the movie reviews according to all at-tack types, i.e., applying one of the 4 attack typesto each word, and trying to reconstruct the originalwords via cross entropy loss.Word RecognitionSpell-CorrectorSwapDropAddKeyAllATD7.212.613.36.911.2ScRNN (78K)6.310.28.79.88.7ScRNN (10K) w/ Backoff VariantsPass-Through8.510.510.711.210.2Neutral8.710.910.811.410.6Background5.48.16.47.66.9Table 2: Word Error Rates (WER) of ScRNN with eachbackoff strategy, plus ATD and an ScRNN trained onlyon the background corpus (78K vocabulary) The errorrates include 5.25% OOV words.ResultsWe calculate the word error rates(WER) of each of the models for different at-tacks and present our ﬁndings in Table 2.

This is a 32% relative error4https://www.afterthedeadline.com/5WecomparedATDwithHunspell(http://hunspell.github.io/), which is used in Linuxapplications. ATD was signiﬁcantly more robust owing totaking context into account while correcting.\f5587reduction compared to the vanilla ScRNN modelwith a pass-through backoff strategy. We can at-tribute the improved performance to the fact thatthere are 5.25% words in the test corpus that areunseen in the training corpus, and are thus onlyrecoverable by backing off to a larger corpus. No-tably, only training on the larger background cor-pus does worse, at 8.7%, since the distribution ofword frequencies is different in the backgroundcorpus compared to the foreground corpus.4.2Robustness to adversarial attacksWe use sentiment analysis and paraphrase detec-tion as downstream tasks, as for these two tasks,1-2 character edits do not change the output labels.Experimental SetupFor sentiment classiﬁca-tion,we systematically study the effect ofcharacter-level adversarial attacks on two architec-tures and four different input formats. The ﬁrstarchitecture encodes the input sentence into a se-quence of embeddings, which are then sequen-tially processed by a BiLSTM. The ﬁrst and laststates of the BiLSTM are then used by the soft-max layer to predict the sentiment of the input. Weconsider three input formats for this architecture:(1) Word-only: where the input words are encodedusing a lookup table; (2) Char-only: where theinput words are encoded using a separate single-layered BiLSTM over their characters; and (3)Word+Char: where the input words are encodedusing a concatenation of (1) and (2) 6.The second architecture uses the ﬁne-tunedBERT model (Devlin et al., 2018), with an inputformat of word-piece tokenization.This modelhas recently set a new state-of-the-art on sev-eral NLP benchmarks, including the sentimentanalysis task we consider here.All modelsare trained and evaluated on the binary versionof the sentence-level Stanford Sentiment Tree-bank (Socher et al., 2013) dataset with only pos-itive and negative reviews.We also consider the task of paraphrase detec-tion.Here too, we make use of the ﬁne-tunedBERT (Devlin et al., 2018), which is trained andevaluated on the Microsoft Research ParaphraseCorpus (MRPC) (Dolan and Brockett, 2005).6Implementation details: The embedding dimension sizefor the word, char and word+char models are 64, 32 and64 + 32 respectively, with 64, 64 and 128 set as the hiddendimension sizes for the three models.BaselinedefensestrategiesTwocommonmethods for dealing with adversarial examplesinclude: (1) data augmentation (DA) (Krizhevskyet al., 2012); and (2) adversarial training (Adv)(Goodfellow et al., 2014).In DA, the trainedmodel is ﬁne-tuned after augmenting the trainingset with an equal number of examples randomlyattacked with a 1-character edit.In Adv, thetrained model is ﬁne-tuned with additional adver-sarial examples (selected at random) that produceincorrect predictions from the current-state classi-ﬁer. The process is repeated iteratively, generatingand adding newer adversarial examples from theupdated classiﬁer model, until the adversarialaccuracy on dev set stops improving.ResultsIn Table 3, we examine the robustnessof the sentiment models under each attack and de-fense method.In the absence of any attack ordefense, BERT (a word-piece model) performsthe best (90.3%7) followed by word+char mod-els (80.5%), word-only models (79.2%) and thenchar-only models (70.3%). However, even single-character attacks (chosen adversarially) can becatastrophic, resulting in a signiﬁcantly degradedperformance of 46%, 57%, 59% and 33%, respec-tively under the ‘all’ setting.Intuitively, one might suppose that word-pieceand character-level models would be more robustto such attacks given they can make use of theremaining context.However, we ﬁnd that theyare the more susceptible. To see why, note thatthe word ‘beautiful’ can only be altered in a fewways for word-only models, either leading to anUNK or an existing vocabulary word, whereas,word-piece and character-only models treat eachunique character combination differently.Thisprovides more variations that an attacker can ex-ploit. Following similar reasoning, add and keyattacks pose a greater threat than swap and dropattacks. The robustness of different models can beordered as word-only > word+char > char-only ∼word-piece, and the efﬁcacy of different attacks asadd > key > drop > swap.Next, we scrutinize the effectiveness of defensemethods when faced against adversarially chosenattacks. Clearly from table 3, DA and Adv are not7The reported accuracy on SST-B by BERT in GlueBenchmarks is slightly higher as it is trained and evalu-ated on phrase-level sentiment prediction task which hasmore training examples compared to the sentence-level taskwe consider.

Even1-character attacks signiﬁcantly degrade classiﬁer performance. Our defenses confer robustness, recovering over76% of the original accuracy, under the ‘all’ setting for all four model classes.effective in this case. We observed that despite alow training error, these models were not able togeneralize to attacks on newer words at test time.ATD spell corrector is the most effective on key-board attacks, but performs poorly on other attacktypes, particularly the add attack strategy.The ScRNN model with pass-through backoffoffers better protection, bringing back the adver-sarial accuracy within 5% range for the swap at-tack. It is also effective under other attack classes,and can mitigate the adversarial effect in word-piece models by 21%, character-only models by19%, and in word, and word+char models by over4.5% . This suggests that the direct training signalof word error correction is more effective than theindirect signal of sentiment classiﬁcation availableto DA and Adv for model robustness.We observe additional gains by using back-ground models as a backoff alternative, because ofits lower word error rate (WER), especially, underthe swap and drop attacks. However, these gainsdo not consistently translate in all other settings,as lower WER is necessary but not sufﬁcient. Be-sides lower error rate, we ﬁnd that a solid defenseshould furnish the attacker the fewest options toattack, i.e. it should have a low sensitivity. Aswe shall see in section § 4.3, the backoff neutralvariation has the lowest sensitivity due to mappingUNK predictions to a ﬁxed neutral word. Thus, itresults in the highest robustness on most of the at-tack types for all four model classes.ModelNo AttackAll attacks1-char2-charBERT89.060.031.0BERT + ATD89.975.861.6BERT + Pass-through89.084.581.5BERT + Neutral84.082.582.5Table 4: Accuracy of BERT, with and without defenses,on MRPC when attacked under the ‘all’ attack setting.\f5589Sensitivity AnalysisBackoffSwapDropAddKeyAllClosed Vocabulary Models (word-only)Pass-Through17.619.70.87.311.3Background19.522.31.19.513.1Neutral17.519.70.87.211.3Open Vocab.

Neu-tral backoff shows lowest sensitivity.Table 4 shows the accuracy of BERT on 200 ex-amples from the dev set of the MRPC paraphrasedetection task under various attack and defensesettings. We re-trained the ScRNN model vari-ants on the MRPC training set for these experi-ments. Again, we ﬁnd that simple 1-2 characterattacks can bring down the accuracy of BERT sig-niﬁcantly (89% to 31%). Word recognition mod-els can provide an effective defense, with both ourpass-through and neutral variants recovering mostof the accuracy. While the neutral backoff modelis effective on 2-char attacks, it hurts performancein the no attack setting, since it incorrectly mod-iﬁes certain correctly spelled entity names. Sincethe two variants are already effective, we did nottrain a background model for this task.4.3Understanding Model SensitivityExperimental setupTo study model sensitiv-ity, for each sentence, we perturb one randomly-chosen word and replace it with all possible per-turbations under a given attack type. The resultingset of perturbed sentences is then fed to the wordrecognizer (whose sensitivity is to be estimated).As described in equation 1, we count the numberof unique predictions from the output sentences.Two corrections are considered unique if they aremapped differently by the downstream classiﬁer.ResultsThe neutral backoff variant has the low-est sensitivity (Table 5). This is expected, as itreturns a ﬁxed neutral word whenever the ScRNNpredicts an UNK , therefore reducing the numberof unique outputs it predicts.Open vocabulary(i.e.char-only, word+char, word-piece) down-stream classiﬁers consider every unique combi-nation of characters differently, whereas word-only classiﬁers internally treat all out of vocab-ulary (OOV) words alike. Hence, for char-only,1213Sensitivity6789101112WER63.259.663.2Pass-throughBackgroundNeutral102030Sensitivity7891011WER51.653.655.2Figure 2: Effect of sensitivity and word error rate onrobustness (depicted by the bubble sizes) in word-onlymodels (left) and char-only models (right).word+char, and word-piece models, the pass-through version is more sensitive than the back-ground variant, as it passes words as is (and eachcombination is considered uniquely).However,for word-only models, pass-through is less sen-sitive as all the OOV character combinations arerendered identical.Ideally, a preferred defense is one with low sen-sitivity and word error rate. In practice, however,we see that a low error rate often comes at the costof sensitivity. We visualize this trade-off in Fig-ure 2, where we plot WER and sensitivity on thetwo axes, and depict the robustness when usingdifferent backoff variants. Generally, sensitivity isthe more dominant factor out of the two, as the er-ror rates of the considered variants are reasonablylow.Human IntelligibilityWe verify if the senti-ment (of the reviews) is preserved with char-levelattacks. In a human study with 50 attacked (andsubsequently misclassiﬁed), and 50 unchanged re-views, it was noted that 48 and 49, respectively,preserved the sentiment.5ConclusionAs character and word-piece inputs become com-monplace in modern NLP pipelines, it is worthhighlighting the vulnerability they add.Weshow that minimally-doctored attacks can bringdown accuracy of classiﬁers to random guess-ing. We recommend word recognition as a safe-guard against this and build upon RNN-basedsemi-character word recognizers. We discover thatwhen used as a defense mechanism, the most ac-curate word recognition models are not always themost robust against adversarial attacks. Addition-ally, we highlight the need to control the sensitiv-ity of these models to achieve high robustness.\f55906AcknowledgementsThe authors are grateful to Graham Neubig, Ed-uard Hovy, Paul Michel, Mansi Gupta, and An-tonios Anastasopoulos for suggestions and feed-back.ReferencesYonatan Belinkov and Yonatan Bisk. 2018.

Executive Statement and Mission Statement The Office of International Religious Freedom (J/IRF) promotes and defends the right of every person in the world to live in accordance with their conscience. Established by congressional statute, J/IRF is guided by the principles enshrined in the First Amendment as well as in Article 18 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: that individuals are free to believe or not believe, to change their beliefs, speak about their beliefs, and to manifest their beliefs through teaching, practice, worship, and observance. While driven by American values, these efforts represent a vital national security imperative. The absence of religious freedom weakens social cohesion and alienates citizens from their government, in turn fomenting inequality, resentment, and unrest. Conversely, expanding religious freedom and bundled rights (such as assembly, association, and expression) fosters political stability, economic growth, and human security, including here at home. In his March 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance (INSSG), President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. articulated this imperative: “[L]eading the world isn’t an investment we make to feel good about ourselves. It’s how we ensure the American people are able to live in peace, security, and prosperity. It’s in our undeniable self-interest... When we defend equal rights of all people — of women and girls, LGBTQI individuals, indigenous communities, people with disabilities, and people of every ethnic background and religion — we help ensure that those rights are protected for our own children here in America.” The INSSG further notes that we defend democracy, the rule of law, and the equal rights of all people and will work hand-in-hand with our allies and partners to address authoritarianism, bolster democratic institutions abroad, promote transparent and accountable systems responsive to their citizens. We will utilize available diplomatic and assistance tools to defend human rights and address discrimination and inequity. To these ends, J/IRF leads the Department’s strategic engagement of – and partnership with – religious actors, organizations, Approved: December 20, 2021 FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \f                  Page 2 of 14                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               FOR PUBLIC RELEASE and institutions as part of equal and broader civil society outreach to achieve U.S. foreign policy objectives. J/IRF liaises extensively with domestic and international civil society – including religious groups and secular rights advocacy organizations – to understand their circumstances, to ensure their views and recommendations are effectively incorporated into all aspects of U.S. foreign policy, and to amplify their voices and expand opportunities for them in international and multinational fora. Secretary of State Antony J. Blinken laid out his policy vision for advancing international religious freedom as follows: “Religious freedom is a human right; in fact, it goes to the heart of what it means to be human – to think freely, to follow our conscience, to change our beliefs if our hearts and minds lead us to do so, to express those beliefs in public and in private. … Religious freedom, like every human right, is universal. All people, everywhere, are entitled to it no matter where they live, what they believe, or what they don’t believe. ... Religious freedom can’t be fully realized unless other human rights are respected, and when governments violate their people’s right to believe and worship freely, it jeopardizes all the others. And religious freedom is a key element of an open and stable society. Without it, people aren’t able to make their fullest contribution to their country’s success. And whenever human rights are denied, it ignites tension, it breeds division.” J/IRF builds diverse and dynamic partnerships with the broadest range of civil society, with equitable and meaningful inclusion of faith actors globally, and trains and equips fellow foreign policy practitioners to do the same. To enable more effective foreign policy, the Department must effectively include the views and insights of religious actors from diverse communities around the world. Within the State Department and the U.S. government, J/IRF leads in direct engagement, cross-cutting collaboration, and awareness raising of the value of effectively partnering with religious actors in the course of diplomatic outreach and activities, to advance shared objectives in U.S. foreign policy.

This Functional Bureau Strategy (FBS) addresses these risks and challenges and articulates U.S. policy for and J/IRF’s approach to advancing universal respect for religious freedom, combatting abuses and violations of this right, promoting human security and inclusion, and engaging religious actors to advance U.S. foreign policy. J/IRF is committed to careful stewardship of limited taxpayer resources and performs annual assessments to review progress made on the goals and objectives established in this FBS. J/IRF MISSION STATEMENT: To strengthen U.S. national security by enabling more inclusive, equitable, and rights-respecting societies and institutions around the world, J/IRF advocates for freedom of religion, belief, or non-belief for every person and promotes the inclusion of civil society, including members of religious communities and organizations, in U.S. diplomacy and policymaking.

Bureau Goals and Objectives Bureau Goal 1: More governments fully respect freedom of religion, belief, and non-belief as part of inclusive, equitable, and rights-respecting societies. • Bureau Goal 1 Description: The right to exercise one’s freedom of thought, conscience, and religion is a human right and is enshrined in the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment. The International Religious Freedom Act of 1998, which created the Office of International Religious Freedom (IRF) and the position of Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom, affirms and institutionalizes this commitment to promoting religious freedom around the world. J/IRF continues to prioritize the integration of religious freedom into the U.S. government’s broader foreign policy objectives. IRF monitors religious persecution and discrimination worldwide, recommends and implements policies in respective regions or countries, and produces the annual International Religious Freedom Reports. The Department identifies egregious religious freedom violators and recommends their designation by the Secretary as “Countries of Particular Concern” (CPCs) or “Entities of Particular Concern” (EPCs), or Special Watch List (SWL) under the International Religious Freedom Act, as well as the consequent sanctions policies toward those countries. Bureau Objective 1.1: Foreign governments take meaningful steps to bring their laws, policies, and practices into conformity with international human rights obligations and commitments and advance religious freedom globally. • Bureau Objective 1.1 Justification and Linkages: Respect for religious freedom is both a core American value and a universal human right reflected in numerous international instruments, such as the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, and the Helsinki Accords. Governments who are parties to these agreements are expected to abide by their obligations and commitments regarding freedom of religion. However, far too many of Approved: December 20, 2021 FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \f                  Page 7 of 14                                                                                                                                                                                                       FOR PUBLIC RELEASE these governments have imposed significant restrictions on the right to adopt a religion or belief of one’s choice and to the freedom, either individually or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest one’s religion or belief in worship, observance, practice, and teaching. In these countries, significant societal intolerance of, and violence against, members of religious minority groups also undermine religious freedom and in some countries is condoned or encouraged by the government. • Bureau Objective 1.1 Risk Considerations: Anti-democratic forces use misinformation, disinformation, and weaponized corruption to exploit perceived weaknesses and sow division within and among free nations, erode existing international rules, and promote alternative models of authoritarian governance. The standard tools of advocacy, including the very act of highlighting religious freedom cases and conditions sometimes generates unintentional negative attention that places victims and/or their families and colleagues at even greater risk of threats, detention/arrest, or physical harm, including death. Bureau Objective 1.2: The U.S. government and our government partners more frequently use unilateral, bilateral, and multilateral tools, such as sanctions, visa restrictions, public statements, and collective actions, to hold governments, non-state actors, and individuals accountable for religious freedom abuses and violations. • Bureau Objective 1.2 Justification and Linkages: Accountability for the worst offenders of religious freedom among government officials with command responsibility, or other complicity, in the commission of religious freedom abuses, atrocities, war crimes, or genocide can serve as a powerful deterrent to other would-be perpetrators. While individual U.S. government sanctions, including those under the Global Magnitsky Act, are reserved for the most egregious offenders and often take a whole-of-government effort to enact, a simple visa ineligibility determination by J/IRF for religious freedom violations under the Immigration and Naturalization Act represents an efficient and effective tool for moderating abusive behavior.

In a global economy, unilateral sanctions could impose greater costs on American firms or influence than on the target, which can find substitute sources of supply, financing, or access. Bureau Objective 1.3: U.S. government personnel are more aware and increase the deployment of the full range of tools at their disposal to advocate for freedom of religion, belief, and non-belief and related freedoms (including the freedoms of expression and assembly) and how to ensure full inclusion of civil society. • Bureau Objective 1.3 Justification and Linkages: J/IRF's mandate includes ensuring the Department is informed by and able to engage with all members of society and advocates consistently for religious freedom as a U.S. foreign policy priority. Under passed Congressional legislation, the Department expanded training on religious freedom issues for Department personnel.  This effort aligns with Joint Strategic Plan goal of revitalizing the diplomatic and development workforce as well as upholding universal values and promoting human dignity. • Bureau Objective 1.3 Risk Considerations: Despite training, Department officials may fail to deploy these tools in any situation. Changing international power dynamics, including the rise of malign actors and changing spheres of influence, could make some tools less effective.

For example, while people of faith make up over 80% of the world’s population, their voices, experiences, and contributions are often undervalued or siloed, with religious leaders engaged only on “religious” issues. Faith leaders from diverse communities around the world are underrepresented in the halls of political and economic power yet have valuable insights and influence. Effective diplomacy requires American representatives to incorporate into all our diplomatic activities consideration of the impactful role played by religion, religious leaders, and religious communities in domestic and international affair. Bureau Objective 2.1: J/IRF facilitates more regular consultation and collaboration with civil society and religious actors and faith-based organizations, including diverse, historically excluded, and marginalized populations, in vital U.S. government and international discussions on matters of shared interest. • Bureau Objective 2.1 Justification and Linkages: Religious actor engagement, as part of an equal and broader engagement with civil society, is a vital component in U.S. efforts to achieve its foreign policy goals. Expanding the space for underrepresented voices across societies worldwide is consistent with the Interim National Security Strategic Guidance’s commitment to partnerships with diverse and dynamic civil society and complements IRF’s statutory mandate to advance universal respect for religious freedom by encouraging more open, vibrant, and inclusive political and social systems.

Worse still, improper use of religious actor engagement can lead to perceptions of U.S. instrumentalization or tokenism of religious figures. Bureau Objective 2.2: Nascent multilateral, multinational, and international alliances and networks that advance J/IRF policy interests are more effective and impactful and become sustainably semi-independent. • Bureau Objective 2.2 Justification and Linkages: Efforts by the United States – or of any one government – are much more likely to succeed when we join with likeminded partners to advance a common vision rooted in international principles and shared interests. Innovative initiatives and strategic partnerships with multilateral, public, and private organizations and individuals are necessary to promote U.S. foreign policy priorities most effectively. J/IRF risks not being able to accomplish its performance goals if it operates in isolation. Supporting collaborative approaches and seeking and leveraging broader stakeholder buy-in will contribute to accomplishing JSP goals of upholding universal values and promoting human dignity as well as mobilizing coalitions to address the global challenges.  It will be more possible to achieve these goals using innovative methods developed with these partnerships and networks. • Bureau Objective 2.2 Risk Considerations: Informal, consensus-based organizations are often plagued by inertia, inaction, or ineffectual pronouncements and this could undermine ultimate impact of these alliances and networks. Current members may prefer to be free riders rather than active participants and unwilling to act.  In an increasingly multipolar system with threats from malign actors, members of civil society may be reluctant to engage with the U.S. directly or participate in U.S.-driven initiatives.

Lack of upward mobility, particular for civil servants, could make a long­term position in the office less compelling for highly competitive individuals. Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Goal 2: Ensure accountability to the American taxpayer • Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Goal 2 Description: In furtherance of the FY 2023 Mission Resource Request (MRR) Guidance of March 16, 2021, J/IRF must be an effective, careful steward of U.S. resources. The office continues to conduct programs that further critical U.S. statutory requirements utilizing digital diplomacy, technological platforms, and public-private partnerships to contain expenditures. Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Objective 2.1: Increase use of evidence and data in decision-making regarding direct diplomatic engagement and foreign assistance resources to strengthens the effectiveness of our expenditures. • Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Objective 2.1 Justification and Linkages: Program evaluations help the office better understand which programs are more appropriate for achieving a particular policy goal. Many programs that work in closed societies and/or on very sensitive political issues demand flexibility and an ability to adapt to changing political contexts, in many cases involving repression.  Effective program design is grounded in a qualitative analysis of the context and issue, supplemented – where possible – by empirical evidence. Learning from ongoing work allows for the expansion of successful work to new contexts. Moreover, evaluations help ensure programs abide by the “do no harm principle.” Increased monitoring and evaluation ensure that programs have a positive impact, are cost effective, and do not result in negative unintended consequences. • Bureau Cross-Cutting Management Objective 2.1 Risk Considerations: Failing to recruit, train, and retain the proper level of highly motivated staff, and to build critical partner capacity and skills, would reduce the ability of IRF to support the mission of the Department and implement its duties under the Interim National Security Strategic Approved: December 20, 2021 FOR PUBLIC RELEASE \f   FOR PUBLIC RELEASE                Page 14 of 14                                      Guidance. Time horizons for program evaluations may be quite lengthy. Limited availability or official authorization of data collection and management tools can undermine efforts to collect information most effectively.

However, in his presentation, President Akio Toyoda stressed the importance of having diverse options. He also shared his sentiments regarding the people of the automotive industry.  Toyota’s part for carbon neutralityAs the opening video ended and the venue lit up, the audience could see Akio and five new different types of vehicles filling the stage. After presenting the vehicles with arms outstretched, Akio began to speak.AkioThank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to join us today. Today, I would like to talk about Toyota’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality—particularly our strategy for battery electric vehicles, which represent one of the most promising options.I believe that achieving carbon neutrality means realizing a world in which all people living on this planet continue to live happily. We want to help realize such a world. This has been and will continue to be Toyota’s wish and our mission as a global company.For that challenge, we need to reduce CO2 emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible.We are living in a diversified world and in an era in which it is hard to predict the future. Therefore, it is difficult to make everyone happy with a one-size-fits-all option. That is why Toyota wants to prepare as many options as possible for our customers around the world.We believe that all electrified vehicles can be divided into two categories, depending on the energy that they use.One category is that of “carbon-reducing vehicles.” If the energy that powers vehicles is not clean, the use of an electrified vehicle, no matter what type it might be, would not result in zero CO2 emissions.The other category is that of “carbon-neutral vehi-cles.” Vehicles in this category run on clean energy and achieve zero CO2 emissions in the whole process of their use. We at Toyota will do our utmost to realize such vehicles.  Five Toyota bZs revealedAkioToday, we would like to present to you what we have been preparing for the future. Let’s start with the Toyota bZ series of our dedicated battery EVs.The Toyota bZ means going “beyond Zero.”Freedom of movement and fun to drive for all. Our goal is not only to reduce CO2 emissions and other negative impacts to zero. Our goal goes beyond that.For the bZ series, we developed a dedicated platform for battery EVs to meet the diverse needs of the global market.Akio walked up to the bZ series behind him and began to explain the highlights of each vehicle one by one.AkioThe first model in the lineup is the bZ4X, which we recently announced. Jointly developing it with Subaru enabled us to pursue smoothness and maneuverability as well as the drivability of a genuine SUV.For its launch next year, we are preparing for the production of the bZ4X at Toyota’s Motomachi Plant right this very moment. We will soon begin delivering it to our customers.Furthermore, we are expanding the bZ series lineup.This midsize SUV has a beautiful silhouette that presages a new era for battery EVs. With just a single glance, its styling invites you to get in and go for a drive.And, this is the most compact SUV in the series—a small battery EV with a comfortable interior designed with Europe and Japan in mind.The more batteries you add to extend cruising range, the bigger, heavier, and more expensive a vehicle becomes. Because this SUV is a small vehicle, there is something we must be thorough and very particu-lar about—power efficiency.The important thing is determining to what degree we can increase a vehicle’s overall energy efficiency, in other words how much less energy a vehicle needs to run. This is exactly the technology that Toyota has been refining for more than 30 years.Putting our best efforts into addressing all aspects of this question, with this vehicle, we are aiming for a power efficiency of 125 watt-hours per kilometer, which would be the highest efficiency rate in the compact SUV class.The next model is a midsize sedan that meets customers’ expectations for a first car.We also have a large SUV with an optional third row of seats that facilitates families experiencing fulfilling times together.What do you think? We will not only add battery EV options to existing vehicle models but will also offer a full lineup of reasonably priced mass-production models, such as the bZ series, to meet the needs of all kinds of customers.By doing so, we hope to deliver to customers around the world the unique and beautiful styling as well as fun-to-drive aspects of battery EVs, and the experi-ence of a life with battery EVs.(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)Toyota Reveals Full Lineup of Battery EVs: Toyota’s Briefing on BEV StrategiesToyota Strengthens BEV Lineup to Keep Offering Options for Everyone (Full Text of President Toyoda’s Presentation) Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT2Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataTaking action with a strong will and passion can absolutely change the futureAkio Toyoda Reflects on His 12-year PresidencyThe COVID-19 pandemic is still affecting regions around the world to this day. Against this backdrop, we at Toyota have continuously worked shoulder to shoulder with fellow manufac­turers who together constitute the automotive industry, with the aim of supporting people’s mobility and energizing the economy as a whole. At the same time, as we aim to pass down to the next generation a beautiful Earth in which everyone can live more happily, we have accelerated investment in initiatives aimed at achieving carbon neutrality as well as those related to CASE technologies, including Woven City. The continuation of these endeavors is, we believe, only possible due to stakeholder support. We hereby extend our wholehearted gratitude to all our stakeholders.Our total sales over the past 12 years reached 300 trillion yen. However, the automotive industry has a broad supply chain. About 70 percent of the parts we use are purchased from suppliers, meaning that about 70 percent of our sales income can be attributed to what we paid for such parts. The cumulative total of these payments to suppliers is about 230 trillion yen. Considering that the annual national budget of Japan is 100 trillion yen, I think we can say that a consider­able amount of money was made outside of Toyota. In addition, the consolidated number of employees increased by 50,000 to 370,000.I believe that I was able to continue as president because of various crises. One after another, we have dealt with “once-in-a-century” crises, such as our fall into the red due to the global financial crisis, followed by the recall crisis, the U.S. Congressional hearings, and the Great East Japan Earthquake. I believe that it is precisely due to these crises that Toyota—and me as its president—have endured to this day. It is due to these crises that more and more of my Toyota colleagues started to listen to my perspective and to try to change.Over the past 12 years, my colleagues and I have tirelessly taken action and faced reality together with those in the genba (on the front lines), trying to find the way forward through an uncharted world, working toward our mission of determining how Toyota should be.Not all of the actions we took during this difficult period were correct or successful. We experi­enced countless failures and made countless mistakes. But it is because I, together with my colleagues, took action, that our failures came to light, upon which we stopped and took steps to improve. This has led us to where we are today. Message from the President(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT3Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataPursuing Best-in-town Around the WorldThe world is changing faster and on a grander scale than we have ever seen. The changes taking place now call into question even things that many of us previously took for granted, such as liberalism and globalization. Witnessing these changes has made me feel more strongly than ever the importance of aiming to be the best in town. It’s not about aiming for global scale or trying to become the best in the world; it’s about being the best in town. Our goal is to be the most trusted, most loved company in the towns where we operate. The idea is to work to bring smiles to the faces of the people in the towns we serve.We might call this idea “give and give.” Not “give and take,” but “give and give.” It means trying to do what you think will be purely good for others, without expecting anything in return, and always doing so with a sense of gratitude.Adhering to this idea will, over time, create trust, leading to mutual growth and development. And that, I believe, will lead to Toyota becoming best in town.Toyota’s Mission of “Producing Happiness for All”With the CASE revolution, I believe that the cars of the future will be connected to communities and people’s lives through information, becoming part of our social systems.Amid this changing landscape, we are striving to completely redesign ourselves as a mobility company and ambitiously working to create an “ever-better mobility society” in which people can live happily, with smiles on their faces.As an automobile company, our history is one of manufacturing industrial products. Uniformity in our workforce was necessary for this work, because it is important to produce consistent quality regardless of the product or who is working on it. However, the needs of customers and society are becoming more diverse, and, going forward, mobility will need to offer attractive performance in terms of both hardware and software. Under such circumstances, I feel that human resources with diverse values and abilities are increasingly important. I also believe that such a diverse and talented workforce will be the driving force behind innovation.\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT4Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataWoven Planet, the software company of the Toyota Group, is at the forefront of such innova­tion. In Woven City, we will demonstrate a mobility society on the level of a city, going beyond hardware and software to connect hearts, and, together with diverse partners, make people in the community happy.The Toyota Philosophy, which we established in 2020, defines our mission as “producing ­happiness for all.” I believe that happiness can take various forms, depending on the person. “Producing happiness for all” does not mean producing the same thing for everyone. Thinking through diversification and engaging in high-mix, low-volume production is the kind of ­“production of happiness for all” for which we aim.At Toyota, a great many people are working together with various stakeholders in their respective genba on tasks of the present, past, and future.Those working on present-oriented tasks continue to build up strength for the work of the future. Those working on past-oriented tasks are continuously making improvements to avoid bringing negative things forward to the future. Those working on future-oriented tasks are using the strength generated by the work on the present and the past to take on new challenges—making mistakes along the way—to push forward into uncharted territory.I have realized something about how Toyota has changed—Toyota, which used to be siloed by function, has now become united as one. What is the driving force behind this? I think it is our mission.“Let’s make ever-better cars.”“Let’s aim to be the best in town, not the best in the world.”“Let’s achieve sustainable growth.”“Let’s work for the sake of others.”During my time as president, the entirety of what I have tried to convey to our 370,000 ­colleagues around the world comes down to the importance of thinking through the ­questions, “What is our purpose as a company?” and “How can we contribute to the world?”I believe that a mission is not something to be shared through words, but rather, through work and action in the genba that represents the mission on the basis of genchi-genbutsu (onsite, hands-on experience).When I was appointed president 12 years ago, I was asked about my aspirations. I said that I wanted to be the most “genba-oriented” president. I cannot foresee the future. All I can do, instead, is to give it a try together with my colleagues at the genba and never stop moving forward, making mistakes and improvements along the way. I believe that there is a world of difference between where we might end up simply by letting things run their course for the next 20 to 30 years and how that same future might look if we continue to take action with passion and the will to make the future better.As the most genba-oriented president, I will continue to try to prove through my actions that we can absolutely change the future if we are all united as one under the mission of “producing happiness for all.”\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT5Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataOur Founding Spirit: For the Sake of Others Sakichi Toyoda Sought to Ease His Mother’s BurdenSakichi Toyoda, the founder of the Toyota Group, was born the son of a carpenter in the village of Yamaguchi, now part of Kosai City, Shizuoka Prefecture, in 1867. Full of curiosity, Sakichi is said to have spent his early years reading a wide range of books, thinking about how he might make a contri­bution to society. One day, Sakichi was thinking about his mother, and how every evening she toiled at her loom, weaving fabric late into the night. He wondered if there might be a way to make her work easier. At the time, weaving was a laborious process, requiring the use of both hands and legs to control the threads of warp and weft in sequence. At the age of 23, Sakichi invented his first loom, the Toyoda Wooden Hand Loom, which could be operated with only one hand and greatly increased efficiency. He patented the loom in May 1891.   Seeking to more dramatically increase capacity, Sakichi turned his attention to developing a ­powered loom and invented Japan’s first, the Toyoda Power Loom, for which he received a ­patent in August 1898.   Sakichi continued to invent and improve looms for more than two decades. This work came to head with the Non-Stop Shuttle Change Toyoda Automatic Loom, Type G, invented in 1924 in collaboration with his son, Kiichiro.   At the time, automatic looms had to be con­stantly watched over by human operators so that they could intervene when unpredictable anoma­lies, such as threads breaking, occurred. The Type G automatic loom used a mechanism to detect anomalies like running out of or breaks in the thread, stopping automatically in response.   Furthermore, the Type G automatically changed the loom’s shuttle when the thread was close to running out. When changing the shuttles holding the weft thread, operators previously had to use their mouths to suck the end of the thread through the eye of the shuttle, inhaling cotton dust, which caused problems in the lungs of many workers. Sakichi, Kiichiro, and the colleagues invented a way to pull the thread through using a simple manual action that took advantage of the thread’s tension.   The drive to serve others and make their work easier—like Sakichi’s desire to ease the burden of his mother and employees—was carried on by his son Kiichiro and remains a core value of Toyota today.   The Type G automatic loom was said to boast the best performance of any loom in the world, improving productivity more than twentyfold and dramatically increasing textile quality. The success of the Type G empowered Kiichiro Toyoda to take on the challenge of establishing a Japanese automotive industry, which many at the time, more than 80 years ago, considered beyond the capabilities of Japanese industry. This was the work to which he would dedicate the rest of his life. Making Domestic Cars and Establishing a Japanese Auto Industry Kiichiro Toyoda, the son of Sakichi, was born in 1894. After graduating from college in 1921, he went to work at Toyoda Boshoku, his father’s company, and traveled to Europe and the United States for the first time. In the 1920s, the streets of the United States were teeming with Ford Model Ts. The automotive era was dawning. In Japan, the number of imported automobiles was gradually rising, but their use was confined to the very wealthy.   Kiichiro was already determined to produce domestic cars and establish a Japanese auto industry. In 1926, Kiichiro was named managing director of the newly established Toyoda Automatic Loom Works, Ltd. and began studying automobiles in earnest. The company established an automotive department in September 1933 and in 1934 officially entered the automotive business, completing its first engine prototype.   In 1935, the first Toyoda Model A1 prototype passenger car was completed, and the Toyoda Model G1 Truck was announced. The very next year, in 1936, mass production of Model AA passenger cars commenced. Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. was established in 1937, with Kiichiro be­coming its president in 1941. Management Crisis, Labor Disputes, and Commitment to Providing Employment In post-war 1949 Japan, measures to curb inflation rapidly stabilized prices, but the resulting reduction in the money supply plunged industry into serious funding shortages, triggering the so-called “Dodge Line Recession.” The prices of iron, steel, and other materials rose, but the officially fixed price of automobiles stood ­unchanged, causing the profitability of the ­automotive industry to decline significantly.   In December of that year, Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. and its labor union signed a memorandum aimed at cooperating to overcome the crisis, stating that that the Company was at all costs to avoid job cuts as a means of overcoming the crisis. Kiichiro had faced employment issues at Toyoda Automatic Loom Works during the Showa Depression in 1930 and was determined to never again allow such a situation to arise. His entry into the automotive industry had been in part a strate­gy to diversify and thereby avoid the recurrence of employment problems, so he was, of course, resolved to avoid job cuts at all costs in the face of the 1949 business crisis.  In January 1950, negotiations with the Bank of Japan began on the Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. reconstruction plan. In April of that year, Toyota Motor Sales Co., Ltd. was established to resolve the problem of delays in payments for vehicles, a major cause of the Company’s financial troubles. Far from improving, however, the situation ­worsened further. As the Company’s business results showed no sign of improvement, ­labor-management negotiations with the Toyota Motor Co., Ltd. labor union deteriorated into a protracted dispute. During collective bargaining that April, the Company made reconstruction proposals centered on job cuts that the labor union could not accept, and the dispute ­continued for another month and a half until a memorandum was finally signed in June.   Accepting responsibility for the labor disputes, Kiichiro Toyoda resigned as president of the Company in May 1950. In March 1952, he agreed to make his much-awaited return to the position, but, before he could do so, he passed away at the age of 57. Nevertheless, his aspirations were kept alive by his colleagues, who persevered with purely home-grown technologies as other Japanese automakers were forming technology alliances with U.S. and European manufacturers. These efforts led to the 1955 launch of the Toyopet Crown, the first passenger car to be developed and built entirely in Japan, a long-held dream of Kiichiro Toyoda. The Spirit of Sakichi and Kiichiro ToyodaBorn into a poor family, Sakichi Toyoda was driven to make others’ work easier, teaching himself in order to invent automatic looms and going on to build Toyota’s foundations. Not content to simply follow the easy path set by his father, Kiicihro Toyoda took on the challenge of domestic car-making, which many at the time said was impossible, navigating tremendous social changes as he built the Company and the foundations of Japan’s automotive industry. The spirit they embodied—of striving to stay ahead of the times and endeavoring to be studious and creative for the betterment of lives and society—lives on in Toyota today. It is the core of what makes us Toyota.Sakichi’s first invention: The Toyoda wooden hand loom(photo provided by the Toyota Commemorative Museum of Industry and Technology)Type G automatic loomModel A1 passenger car proto­type completion ceremony Our Founding Spirit  The Toyoda Principles and Toyota Philosophy  Toyota Production System (TPS)\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT6Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataThe Toyoda Principles and Toyota PhilosophyIn 1935, five years after the passing of Sakichi Toyoda, the Company had grown to more than 10,000 employees as the automotive business ramped up. The Toyoda Principles were compiled at this time to convey Sakichi’s teachings to all employees and provide guidelines for all aspects of their work.   The top management of Toyota that took over from Kiichiro, Sakichi’s son, further codified the Toyota Philosophy, encompassing Toyota’s values, priorities, and strengths. This philosophy provided the answer to the fundamental question, “What is Toyota?” as a touchstone for the entire Group.  The automotive industry is experiencing a once-in-a-century transfor­mation. In the same way that Toyota transitioned from loom maker to automaker, we are now reinventing ourselves as a mobility company.  To guide us as we push forward into the future amid an era of uncertainty, we have now created the Toyota Philosophy Cone, a graphic representation of the Toyota Philosophy presented in a shape that evokes both the spools of thread used in looms and the traffic cones used to guide cars. Toyota Philosophy ConeToyota’s basic principles Toyoda Principles The Toyoda Principles, or Five Main Principles of Toyoda, have since been handed down to every Toyota Group company and serve as guidelines for all employees.Toyota’s mission since its foundationProducing Happiness for AllBorn into a family of poor farmers, Sakichi Toyoda built the bedrock of today’s Toyota by inventing the Toyoda Automatic Loom by himself. Abandoning the easy path left by his father, Kiicihro Toyoda took on the challenge of making cars. Many at the time said it was impossible.  Their passion was carried on by those who worked with them, shaping the Toyota we know today. What they truly wanted to make was a sense of happiness for any customer who used their products, as well as happiness for every person involved in the work related to those products. The core of this aspiration was the idea of producing happiness for all.   However, during Toyota’s long history, there was a brief time when we turned our focus to numbers and gave less thought to people. Primarily due to our rapid expansion in the late 20th century, we faced many problems, including quality concerns and trade friction.  Let us not forget that there are some things that machines cannot create. Only humans can invest the time and energy to bring life to such things. We strive to stay ahead of the times, endeavoring to be studious and creative for the betterment of lives and society. Using our technology, we work toward a future of convenience and happiness available to all. This is our mission, producing ­happiness for all, and the core of what makes us ToyotaThe future vision that Toyota aspires to Creating Mobility for AllToyota strives to raise the quality and availability of mobility, so that individuals, businesses, municipalities, and communities can do more, while achieving a sustainable relationship with our planet. This is our new destination.  Motorization has enabled freedom of movement and has brought people and society closer. As a result, more people than ever can now experience mobility, including the “fun to drive” experience.  And yet, challenges related to mobility persist. There are still many potential opportunities to overcome inconveniences and break through the impossible with new possibilities.   “To move” can refer to physical motion, but also to the experience of being emotionally moved. It is our role to move people and bring mobility to life—to move hearts, minds, and bodies.

These tangible and intangible aspects together power Toyota: imagination fuels monozukuri, and monozukuri sparks new imagination. In advancing this cycle, it is essential to center the perspectives of our many stakeholders, imagining their points of view.  We work with our stakeholders and partners, each elevating the other, uniting the strengths of all three to create new and unique value.

Our Founding Spirit  The Toyoda Principles and Toyota Philosophy  Toyota Production System (TPS)With an eye toward “Producing Happiness for All” - Selections from the Q&A session of Toyota’s 1H/2Q financial results briefingWhat is Toyota?Sakichi Toyoda’sresolutionFacilitiesOperationsManagement isabout peopleStakeholders\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT7Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataToyota Production System (TPS)In May 2020, at Toyota’s financial results briefing, President Akio Toyoda reflected on the efforts the Company had made over the previous few years, saying:“Over the past few years, we came to feverishly engage in both a fight to bring back what makes us Toyota and the complete redesign of Toyota for the future.”Revisiting messages President Toyoda gave starting from a few years ago, two of the things he repeatedly has said that makes us Toyota are the Toyota Production System, or TPS, and cost reduction.  Last year, at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan, a new training program was started to nurture a select group of “TPS leaders” from various divisions across the Company. To emphasize the importance of the program and to share his own thoughts about TPS, President Toyoda joined the kick-off session.  1. \u0007Sakichi Toyoda Sought to Ease His Mother’s BurdensThis training program was created for Toyota’s manage­ment leaders who don’t work at manufacturing front lines to gain a deeper understanding of TPS in order to help the Company accelerate its efforts to bring back the essence of what makes it Toyota as it looks to completely redesign Toyota for the future.Toyoda I was a little concerned to hear today’s participants’ statement of determination to “change Toyota any way possible by utilizing what’s learned and obtained through this program.”   There are two key concepts deeply rooted in Toyota since its foundation, or even before then. Does anyone know what they are?Participant AI think they are “Just-in-Time” and “automation with a human touch,” or “Jidoka.”Toyoda That’s it! That’s what I wanted to hear! (everyone laughs)That’s why I volunteered to be the lecturer today to help kick off the TPS training program. Hopefully, I can help narrow the gap between my understanding of Jidoka and Just-in-Time and yours.  First of all, let’s talk about Jidoka. It’ll be easier to explain the concept by first looking at the automatic loom invented by Sakichi Toyoda. Thinking about his mother, and how she toiled to weave fabrics every evening and late into the night, the young Sakichi wondered if there might be a way to ease her burden. When Sakichi developed his first automated loom, both hands were used to control the threads of warp and weft. His invention allowed his mother to operate a loom using only one hand. It also helped improve quality, increasing overall efficiency and dramatically improving productivity.Often at Toyota, TPS is considered the process of making things efficient, and people talk about it as if changing work processes is TPS’s purpose. But, I think the purpose should always be to make someone’s work easier.  2. \u0007Improving Productivity was not the Main PurposeThe Type G automatic loom is the machine that helped drive a redesign of Toyota’s business. Automatic looms back then were always monitored by one operator, based on a mindset of “one person, one machine.” Each person was the “guard” of their machine.This was because operators were unable to predict abnormalities.With this automatic loom, Toyota was able to secure the capital required to shift its business model from an automatic loom manufacturer to a car manufacturer. This was because a world-leading automatic loom company in the United Kingdom asked Toyota to sell its automatic loom technology.The most common abnormalities that occurred when weaving fabric with automatic looms were when thread ran out or broke. The Type G was able to detect such abnormalities at a time when there were no sensors.   When the thread ran out, it automatically changed to another wooden shuttle with a new thread.   The shuttle needs to have the thread end out on the surface. Before this machine was invented, workers had to suck it out themselves. The problem was that there was a lot of cotton dust in the air in textile factories, which could damage workers’ lungs when they inhaled deeply. Sakichi invented a new feature that automatically brought out the thread end. This invention was the result of Sakichi simply exploring a desire to do something for his team members on the manufacturing front lines who were suffering damage in their lungs.  Thus, Sakichi determined what the abnormalities were and then came up with system to prevent or stop them. As a result, productivity improved—not the other way around. He did not do all this just to improve productivity.  3. \u0007How President Toyoda Sees Jidoka (Automation with a Human Touch)In my view, Jidoka is about being centered on people. It’s about putting yourself in the shoes of someone working there. You can’t just issue orders to improve efficiency or reduce resources from the safety of your position far from the front lines. Toyota also has this idea about adjusting the work per person to match the full output of one unit of manpower (pursuing ichi-nin-ku in Japanese).This concept of ichi-nin-ku means the amount of work that one worker can or should accomplish in a day. We all only have 24 hours in a day. This applies equally to everyone. And employees spend a lot of that time devoted to work for a company. Knowing this, supervisors must make the work being done by team members as meaningful as possible. That is what Toyota’s manufacturing front lines have been pursuing.The focus is creating more free time for workers by eliminating waste in work processes to reduce overtime. Pursuing ichi-nin-ku means valuing each person’s time.   4. \u0007How President Toyoda Sees Just-in-TimeA phrase that is commonly associated with the concept of Just-in-Time is “provide what is needed, when needed, in the amount needed.” The key to understand­ing Just-in-Time is the idea of “lead time,” the amount of time required for products or services to be delivered after they are ordered.Toyoda What comes to mind when you think about Just-in-Time?  Taking a “what is needed when needed” approach, to respond quickly to customer needs, there would need to be a lot of inventory, right? One finished vehicle consists of about 30,000 parts. So, it would follow that for a production line to flexibly produce orders quickly, a tremendous amount of inventory would need to on hand, right?Participant BBut if we know and can meet what customers want...Toyoda Who do you mean by “customers”?Participant BEach downstream process... or our final end users.Toyoda But we sell around 10 million new vehicles annually, and that means we have the same number of customers. How can we understand what is needed by each specific customer? We can’t, so instead, we have to have a lean operation in place to detect abnormalities right away and halt the pipeline so that we can make improvements quickly. And that’s why we need Just-in-Time.  In this way, I think the key concept that makes Just-in-Time easier to understand is “lead time.”At Toyota, a common term for the next process in a workflow, whether it be in manufacturing or in an office, is “downstream process.” Those in the downstream are considered a “customer.” President Toyoda was trying to convince the participants to think of “Just-in-Time” in the context of the bigger picture, to consider not only the immediate downstream, but how things relate to the company as a whole to deliver Toyota’s vehicles to the end customers “just-in-time.”  5. \u0007Achieving the Lead Time of a Sushi Restaurant?Take, for example, sushi. When you go to an authen­tic sushi restaurant, are the finished orders just waiting in front of the chef? I don’t think so. Each piece is made to order. You can’t prepare every specification in advance for 10 million customers.It’s important to understand what we can’t do. The key, then, is trying to shorten lead time.

Looking back on our history of car marking, I see two key themes. The first is “sports cars.”The 1960s were a key era for Toyota’s sports cars. This decade saw the birth of many sports cars that would eventually achieve legendary status, such as the Publica Sports, Sports 800, and 2000GT. Then, in the 1980s, Toyota launched the Supra, MR2, Celica, and Levin/Trueno. In this way, Toyota has created sports cars that bring together the most cutting-edge technological prowess of the era every two decades. Why is that? I think it is because Toyota treats sports car development as the front line for developing the skills and knowledge that will be passed down as well as human resource development. For Toyota, sports car develop­ment has been like a rite of renewal and rebirth carried out every 20 years. Following this cycle, the next generation of Toyota sports cars should have hit the scene in the 2000s. They did not. Around that time, Toyota was growing its vehicle sales, mainly outside Japan, and pursuing scale expansion. Amid that push, the role of its old renewal rite was forgotten, and sports cars disappeared from Toyota’s vehicle lineupI was not the only one who sensed how dangerous this was. Our test drivers, in fact, felt the danger more keenly than I did. I think that feeling was part of why Hiromu Naruse, then Toyota’s chief test driver, told me, very frankly, that he didn’t want to be preached to about cars by someone who didn’t know anything about them. But, he said, if I was interested, he would teach me to drive. That was the start of my journey, under the new nickname Morizo, to becoming a master driver. From there, though a decade late, Toyota went on to develop the LFA in the 2010s, recapturing the “secret sauce,” that flavor unique to Toyota and Lexus cars. We went on to revive the 86 and the Supra, as well, but all of these were made in collabo­ration with outside partners. We still wanted to once again make a sports car that would be all our own. This dream led to the devel­opment of the GR Yaris. For years, I have constantly been talking about “ever-better car making.” Now, as the number of my colleagues taking action with me has grown, this has evolved into “ever-better car making from a starting point in motorsports.” The second key theme is “long sellers.”Toyota’s long sellers have included the Crown and Corolla, which drove the motorization of Japan, as well as the Prius, which created the hybrid electric vehicle market. More rugged long sellers include the Land Cruiser, Hiace, and Probox. The Coaster and Century were long sellers, too. Indeed, Toyota boasts numerous models that have been beloved by customers for decades.Despite this, when Toyota was focusing on the number of vehicles sold and making vehicles mainly for overseas markets, the position of long-selling cars within the Company shifted greatly. The Crown and Corolla began to undergo regular model changes based solely on an annual schedule, while rugged vehicles like the Land Cruiser and Hiace no longer had model changes at all. These long-selling cars had been beloved by customers and an integral part of their lives for so long, but now it was considered unimportant for them to change or evolve. However, I believe that only by constantly changing to meet the needs of the times can At the November 2021 Nationwide Toyota Dealers Convention, President Toyoda Spoke About Product-centered Management.

We have already begun working to reclaim this approach.The Vitz, as it was known in Japan, was unified under the name Yaris, which had taken root overseas, and we expanded its lineup to include the GR Yaris and Yaris Cross. Similarly, the Corolla lineup saw the addition of the Corolla Sport and Corolla Cross. Our strategy was to build a lineup tailored to current needs while leveraging the brand strength of our long sellers.“Let’s make ever-better cars.” This idea was the impetus for the transforma­tion of Toyota’s car making. Three pillars supported this transformation.The first pillar, and the first that we took on, was the Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA). To achieve excellent performance in the basic functions of a car—propulsion, turning, and stopping—a solid platform is essential. However, creating a new platform and promot­ing standardization is not so easy. I found myself wishing that Toyota had moved away from the one-model, one-platform approach and imple­mented platform reforms while its sales volumes and revenues had been expanding. During the very difficult time after the 2008 global financial crisis, when Toyota fell into the red and we could not increase unit sales, we all had to grit our teeth and work even harder. The fruit of this labor was a powerful tool—the TNGA. I believe that it is precisely because we have the TNGA that we are able to restore the sports cars and long sellers that for so many years have supported the Toyota brand to their proper places and tackle the challenge of building up their lineups.The second pillar is the in-house company system. A defining characteristic of Toyota is its full lineup of diverse vehicles that meet a comprehensive range of customer needs. Offering a full lineup means that we must always have people who are passionate and responsible about creating cars in all genres, from sports cars to commercial vehicles. Ensuring this is the true objective of the in-house company system. The lure of increasing unit sales and revenue in the short term is hard to resist. This is why we must nurture people and organizations capable of focusing and placing the highest priority on creating the cars that Toyota and society really need.The final pillar is a figure at the top who can take final responsibility. It’s embarrassing to say so myself, but I think that one thing that sets Toyota apart, that it has and other OEMs don’t, is a master driver in top management. A president who can take responsibility for the “flavor” of the products we put out. A president who is able to definitively say “no” to projects, even ones that our development teams have worked hard on, if they don’t have that unique Toyota/Lexus flavor.Morizo, master driver, and president of Toyoda. Wearing these three hats at once, I have gone to front lines myself and worked along­side my colleagues these past 12 years. I am sure that all of that effort shows in our products. By continuing to make ever-better cars, our brand will continue to evolve. This is what I believe to be the essence of product-­centered management. It means not aiming to be the biggest in the world in terms of units sold, but aiming to be the best in town by creating better cars that bring smiles to customers’ faces. At first, when I spoke about making ever-­better cars, few understood me, or tried. However, thanks to the support of my ­colleagues who believed in me and to the support of our dealers, I think that Toyota’s products have slowly but surely changed for the better. Going forward, we will continue to do our utmost to make ever-better cars. I hope to convey the heart and the story of Toyota, which we put into every product, to all our dealers and as many customers as possible. Nothing would please me more than if that story were to become one of the many new stories connecting the hearts of our dealers and customers. History of Toyota’s car making Two key words \t1.

I think that they came to under­stand Kiichiro’s words not just intellectually, but in a deeper, visceral way. Come to think of it, it has been 14 years since Hiromu Naruse and I drove used Altezzas in the 24 Hours of Nürburgring endurance race. Racing on the streets toughens people up and makes cars stron­ger. I want to enable Toyota to make cars that way again. That may be what I have been working toward all along.In 2009, when I became president, I implored our employees to make ever-better cars. Since then, I often get asked what kind of cars are ever-better cars.I have a certain idea of what makes a better car. It’s not necessarily the same as someone else’s idea of a better car. What makes a better car depends on the driver. It is for this reason that cars can only be made in the streets and not at a desk.However, back in 2009, not many people understood what I meant by this. It’s not enough to simply tell someone that the up my mind to enter the race. Although four months was hardly enough time for the engineers to prepare, I safely finished the 24-hour race as well as three subsequent races. For each race, they continued to improve the car, making it stronger and faster. The other car is the GR Yaris.We made this car for a specific purpose: to win the World Rally Championship.Until now, Toyota has made its race cars by modifying its mass-production cars. That was the limit of what we could do. The GR Yaris is our attempt to flip this approach by designing a race car from the ground up. From the initial stages of development, we reached out to professional drivers to have them drive the car. When problems came to light during their drives, they were fixed, and then we had them drive the car again. Development progressed nimbly, and the car evolved into one that is fun to drive. As Morizo (my driver name), I partnered with this car on the Gamagori dirt course for training to hone my driving skills. Drive it, break it, fix it, strengthen it, drive it again, and break it again. By repeating this process, the engineers not only advanced the car’s development, they also changed I think that these words provide the core principle of “ever-better car making from a starting point in motorsports.” There were two cars that led me to this core principle.I rode in the first of these cars with racer Kamui Kobayashi at Gamagori four months before entering the Super Taikyu 24-hour race. It was while I was in the car that I made In 1952, shortly before his death, the founder Kiichiro Toyoda wrote the following.“The Japanese automobile production industry must master the art of manufacturing passenger vehicles. In order to test the durability and perfor­mance of their cars, companies ought to participate in auto races, demonstrate the full performance of their vehicles, and compete for superiority. This will both lead to progress in their vehicles and spark the enthusiasm of automobile fans. Such races must not be regarded as a simple matter of curiosity, for they are indispensable to the development of Japan’s automobile manufacturing industry.” Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven CityMaking Ever-better Cars: From a Starting Point in MotorsportsRecently, President Akio Toyoda has often been adding “from a starting point in ­motorsports” when using the phrase ­“ever-better car making.” He spoke about the idea behind this at the press conference announcing the 2022 TOYOTA GAZOO Racing drivers and management members.Kiichiro Toyoda\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT11Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataNow that this team has come together, we have at last reached the point where we can begin ever-better car making from a starting point in motorsports. Motorsports are the starting point for making ever-better cars. We will leverage motorsports to make ever-­better cars, from the top categories driven by professional drivers, to customer motorsports driven by amateur racing drivers, the sports cars driven by our many customers, and even down family cars, and beyond that, automated driving.As for myself, what I know is that I love cars, and I love driving. I am very fortunate to now have others who love cars, love driving, and are passionate about motorsports working alongside me. There were many things I wanted to learn from him, with his knowledge of a wide range of cars, including those of Mitsubishi and Subaru. We made only one promise to each other: to make the Yaris at the end of the season the strongest Yaris ever. The team kept this promise.Our current team principal, Jari-Matti Latvala, was a star driver for other teams before Toyota returned to the WRC. He was such a star, in fact, that I waited in the hotel lobby for him to come out when I first went to watch the WRC. Since then, he has helped secure numerous victories as a Toyota driver, and this season, as team principal, became a triple crown holder. Over the past five years, Latvala has, without a doubt, constantly helped make the Yaris stronger as both a driver and principal. For next year’s WRC, to which Toyota will bring a new car, I am sure he will assemble a team of professionals that is like a close family and hates to lose. Recently, I have been deliberately adding “from a starting point in motorsports” to the phrase “ever-better car making.” For 12 years, people have told us that there’s no way that Toyota can realize this kind of car making. Now, however, Toyota has finally changed, realizing a kind of car making in which not only its engineers and mechanics, but its professional drivers, professional engineers, and professional mechanics all work together, as a team, to advance car making. The other two cars had to be retired from the race. After the race, the drivers said to me, “We’re sorry it won’t be at the very top, but would you stand on the winner’s podium with us?”The difference between first and second place podium was a height of about 70 centimeters. I thought, is this frustration—this second-place podium—the highest we can reach? I desperately wanted to help the drivers stand at the top. I wanted to prove that Toyota could make the kind of strong car that they would want to drive. I swore to myself, standing on that podium one level down, that we would change Toyota to be capable of the kind of car making needed to achieve that, no matter what. That year, we took on another new challenge: The World Rally Championship, or WRC.We entrusted the task of putting together a team from scratch to Tommi Mäkinen. A legend himself, having won the WRC four times, he knew how to win. However, that was not the only reason I asked for his help. streets make the car. I knew I had to show them what it means. That’s why I continued to take part in the 24 Hours of Nürburgring endurance race.“The streets make cars and toughen people up” became something of a catchphrase. However, changes in car making do not happen so fast. On the front lines, each department was focused on its own specialized area of car making, and they were not handling the overarching car making process as a united team.  That was when I first went to Le Mans. It was the year after the car driven by Kazuki Nakajima, which was in the lead, suffered a mechanical failure just before the finish line. When I dropped into the pit, the drivers talked with me. In a qualifying race, Kamui Kobayashi had seized pole position with an astounding time. He passed the trophy to me while thanking me. It made me want to get closer to the drivers and race alongside them. Racing, however, is hard. That year, only Kazuki’s car finished the race, with the team coming in 8th overall, and 2nd in its class.

However, in his presentation, President Akio Toyoda stressed the importance of having diverse options. He also shared his sentiments regarding the people of the automotive industry.  Toyota’s part for carbon neutralityAs the opening video ended and the venue lit up, the audience could see Akio and five new different types of vehicles filling the stage. After presenting the vehicles with arms outstretched, Akio began to speak.AkioThank you very much for taking time out of your busy schedule to join us today. Today, I would like to talk about Toyota’s strategy for achieving carbon neutrality—particularly our strategy for battery electric vehicles, which represent one of the most promising options.I believe that achieving carbon neutrality means realizing a world in which all people living on this planet continue to live happily. We want to help realize such a world. This has been and will continue to be Toyota’s wish and our mission as a global company.For that challenge, we need to reduce CO2 emissions as much as possible, as soon as possible.We are living in a diversified world and in an era in which it is hard to predict the future. Therefore, it is difficult to make everyone happy with a one-size-fits-all option. That is why Toyota wants to prepare as many options as possible for our customers around the world.We believe that all electrified vehicles can be divided into two categories, depending on the energy that they use.One category is that of “carbon-reducing vehicles.” If the energy that powers vehicles is not clean, the use of an electrified vehicle, no matter what type it might be, would not result in zero CO2 emissions.The other category is that of “carbon-neutral vehi­cles.” Vehicles in this category run on clean energy and achieve zero CO2 emissions in the whole process of their use. We at Toyota will do our utmost to realize such vehicles.  Five Toyota bZs revealedAkioToday, we would like to present to you what we have been preparing for the future. Let’s start with the Toyota bZ series of our dedicated battery EVs.The Toyota bZ means going “beyond Zero.”Freedom of movement and fun to drive for all. Our goal is not only to reduce CO2 emissions and other negative impacts to zero. Our goal goes beyond that.For the bZ series, we developed a dedicated platform for battery EVs to meet the diverse needs of the global market.Akio walked up to the bZ series behind him and began to explain the highlights of each vehicle one by one.AkioThe first model in the lineup is the bZ4X, which we recently announced. Jointly developing it with Subaru enabled us to pursue smoothness and maneuverability as well as the drivability of a genuine SUV.For its launch next year, we are preparing for the production of the bZ4X at Toyota’s Motomachi Plant right this very moment. We will soon begin delivering it to our customers.Furthermore, we are expanding the bZ series lineup.This midsize SUV has a beautiful silhouette that presages a new era for battery EVs. With just a single glance, its styling invites you to get in and go for a drive.And, this is the most compact SUV in the series—a small battery EV with a comfortable interior designed with Europe and Japan in mind.The more batteries you add to extend cruising range, the bigger, heavier, and more expensive a vehicle becomes. Because this SUV is a small vehicle, there is something we must be thorough and very particu­lar about—power efficiency.The important thing is determining to what degree we can increase a vehicle’s overall energy efficiency, in other words how much less energy a vehicle needs to run. This is exactly the technology that Toyota has been refining for more than 30 years.Putting our best efforts into addressing all aspects of this question, with this vehicle, we are aiming for a power efficiency of 125 watt-hours per kilometer, which would be the highest efficiency rate in the compact SUV class.The next model is a midsize sedan that meets customers’ expectations for a first car.We also have a large SUV with an optional third row of seats that facilitates families experiencing fulfilling times together.What do you think? We will not only add battery EV options to existing vehicle models but will also offer a full lineup of reasonably priced mass-production models, such as the bZ series, to meet the needs of all kinds of customers.By doing so, we hope to deliver to customers around the world the unique and beautiful styling as well as fun-to-drive aspects of battery EVs, and the experi­ence of a life with battery EVs.(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)Toyota Reveals Full Lineup of Battery EVs: Toyota’s Briefing on BEV StrategiesToyota Strengthens BEV Lineup to Keep Offering Options for Everyone (Full Text of President Toyoda’s Presentation) Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT14Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate Data  Offering a full lineup of BEVsAkioToyota is a global company supported by customers around the world.The Toyota brand now offers more than 100 models of engine-only vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, and fuel cell electric vehicles in more than 170 countries and regions.The Lexus brand has introduced more than 30 models of engine-only vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles in more than 90 countries and regions.Furthermore, we will expand the options for carbon-neutral vehicles by offering a full lineup of battery EVs. Specifically, we plan to roll out 30 battery EV models by 2030, globally offering a full lineup of battery EVs in the passenger and commercial segments.Please take a look. This is Toyota’s great battery EV lineup.  A new chapter for LexusWith Akio’s arms once again stretched wide, the white wall of curtain behind the bZ series cascaded down to reveal 11 more vehicles. Akio led the applause standing in front of a total of 16 BEVs.AkioWelcome to our showroom of the future!First, let’s start with the Lexus brand. Lexus strives to be the brand that people who know authenticity choose at the end of the day. As brand holder, I continue to believe that.Lexus has pursued unique styling and a unique driving signature, and, as a pioneer in hybrid electric technology, it has refined its electrification technolo­gy. Now, Lexus is embarking on a new chapter.Koji Sato, President, Lexus International & Chief Branding Officer LEXUS ELECTRIFIEDThis is the name of our electrification efforts here at Lexus.Extracting the full potential of the vehicle through electrification technology—that is what electrification means to Lexus.We will deliver a unique electrified Lexus that combines linear motor acceleration/deceleration, brake feeling, and exhilarating handling to further pursue the joy of driving.In particular, we believe that the battery EV will become the future symbol of Lexus as a model that most clearly expresses the evolution of the automobile brought about by electrification.The latest of these models is the Lexus RZ.The process of strengthening the fundamentals and pursuing the Lexus Driving Signature will not change even if it is a battery EV.The endless pursuit of the Lexus Driving Signature will move to the next stage through development of the new sports battery EV.With bold proportions and the low ride height essential to a sports car, it will showcase the unique driving performance of a Lexus and become a model that symbolizes the future of the brand.Acceleration time will be in the low 2-second range with a cruising range over 700 km, and, with the possible use of solid-state batteries in mind, we will aim to create a truly high-performance battery EV.Through battery EVs, we will develop Lexus into a brand that offers a variety of experiences harnessing performance developments that only a carmaker like Lexus could achieve and by honing the craft of making ever more personal products.AkioLexus will develop a next-generation battery EV sports car that inherits the unique flavor, or secret sauce, of performance cultivated via the development of the LFA. We will extend the flavor refined this way to other models as we evolve Lexus into a brand centered on battery EVs.We can position batteries and electric motors to bring more freedom to battery EVs. This freedom will allow us to be more attuned to our customers, such as by meeting the various needs of different regions, the various lifestyles of our customers, and, when it comes to commercial vehicles, everything from long-distance transport to last-mile delivery.  An EV for everyoneSimon Humphries, Design Senior General ManagerThe world is becoming ever more diverse. People are increasingly confident in making their own choices to lead free and enjoyable lifestyles.At Toyota we believe that truly good products create new experiences for the customer, enhancing their chosen lifestyle directions. From that point of view, each electric vehicle should be unique and special, not only those on dedicated platforms but also those related to existing models.Whether that means building on Toyota’s off-road heritage to create new and exciting recreational experiences or finding new ways to combine versatility with dynamic driving.Commercial-use models such as the e-palette will change the face of daily life in the city. But we will also challenge smaller size model segments for new mobility solutions.Compact ultra-versatility will open up new and exciting possibilities for both work use and for youngsters. And, we will take new approaches for the smallest segments, such as “Made-for-sharing,” where different variations cater to different business scenes.And, last, but certainly not least, car fans like Akio Toyoda will certainly not be disappointed.The EV era is an opportunity and a chance for more variety and more fun!An EV for you, an EV for me, and an EV for everyone.  \u0007Many years of accumulated experience gives Toyota a competitive edgeAkio“An EV for everyone.” So, what did you think about Toyota’s battery EVs?The future that we showed you today is by no means far away. Most of the Toyota battery EVs that we introduced here are models that will be coming out in the next few years.(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY) Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT15Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataWe aim to achieve global sales of 3.5 million battery EVs per year by 2030.Lexus aims to realize a full lineup of battery EVs in all vehicle segments by 2030 and to have battery EVs account for 100 percent of its vehicle sales in Europe, North America, and China, for a total of 1 million units globally. And, it aims for battery EVs to make up 100 percent of its global vehicles sales in 2035.With that, Akio began to explain Toyota’s BEV initiatives in more detail.He walked the audience through all areas, starting with Toyota’s history of vehicle and battery development and the securing of resources and energy to achieve carbon neutrality, going even so far as to introduce initiatives undertaken at Toyota’s manufacturing sites.AkioTo achieve these goals, we have invested in various areas for a long time.In the area of vehicle development, in 1997, Toyota launched the Prius, the world’s first mass-production hybrid electric vehicle. But in fact, our development of battery EVs had started before that.In 1992, we established the Electric Vehicle Development Division, and we introduced the RAV4 EV to the market in 1996.After that, in the 2000s, we demonstrated our small prototype commuter EV “e-com” in various places. Furthermore, in 2012, we introduced the “COMS,” an ultra-small EV, and the small “eQ” EV. Thus, we have long explored the potential of battery EVs. We launched the “C+pod” and “C+walk” this year and have accelerated the development of battery EVs, including the “e-Palette,” that provide people with freedom of movement in various scenes. At the same time that we started our development of battery EVs in the early 1990s, we also began our development of fuel cell electric vehicles, which run on hydrogen. In 2002, we introduced the Toyota FCHV to the market and went through various demonstrations, and in 2008, the vehicle was redesigned into the Toyota FCHV-adv. Based on such long-term efforts, in 2014, the first-generation Mirai was finally launched. Since then, using technologies concerned to power other vehicles, such as buses and large trucks, our fuel cell electric vehicles have also continued to evolve.In the area of batteries, Toyota has continued to research, develop, and produce batteries in-house for many years.In 1996, we established what is today Prime Earth EV Energy. While refining our technologies related to nickel-metal hydride batteries, we started accelerating the development of lithium-ion batteries in 2003. Furthermore, since establishing our Battery Research Division in 2008, we have been advancing research on solid-state batteries and other next-generation batteries.Last year, we established Prime Planet Energy & Solutions to accelerate integrated efforts in the battery business.Over the past 26 years, we have invested nearly 1 trillion yen and produced more than 19 million batteries. We believe that our accumulated experience is an asset that gives us a competitive edge.Going forward, we will increase our new investment in batteries from the 1.5 trillion yen announced in September 2021 to 2 trillion yen, aiming to realize even more-advanced, high-quality, and affordable batteries.When it comes to natural resources, Toyota Tsusho began conducting lithium and other surveys as early as 2006 and has been working to secure stable sources.And, in the area of energy, Toyota Tsusho has been working to secure renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power generation for more than 30 years.Furthermore, at manufacturing plants, we are aiming to achieve carbon neutrality by 2035 by continuously making steady improvements toward reducing energy use and by expanding the use of innovative production engineering technology.In this diversified and uncharted era, it is important to flexibly change the type and quantity of products produced while keeping an eye on market trends.We believe that the reduction in lead times and high-mix, low-volume production methods that we have cultivated through the Toyota Production System, along with the steady efforts of Japanese manufacturing, will enable us to be competitive going forward.We will continue to advance initiatives in all areas together with many of our partners.  \u0007“The future is something to be created by all of us.”Akio, who had thus far detailed Toyota’s sincere ap­proach to BEVs, concluded with a reiteration of Toyota’s reasons for adhering to a multi-solution strategy and his thoughts on an automotive industry united in striving to achieve carbon neutrality.AkioEnergy plays a critical role in achieving carbon neutrality. At present, the energy situation varies greatly from region to region. That is exactly why Toyota is committed to providing a diversified range of carbon-neutral options to meet whatever the needs and situations might be in every country and region.It is not us but local markets and our customers who decide which options to choose.As for why we try to keep so many options open, in terms of business management, one might think it would be more efficient to focus on fewer choices.However, we believe that quickly adapting to chang­es in the future is more important than trying to predict the future, which is uncertain. That is why we want to keep options available for our customers until the right path is clear.We at Toyota aim to be a company that contributes to the global environment, seeks to bring happiness to people, acts, and stays close to its customers. To sum it up, we want to become a company that produces happiness for all, for both individuals and society.We want to pass on an ever-better future for the children of today and those who will come after them. We always want the future to be brighter.I believe that the future is something to be created by all of us together. Japan’s automotive industry is home to our 5.5 million colleagues who have supported Japanese manufacturing and mobility. And, we have many more colleagues throughout the world. If we all take action with unity of mind and with will and passion, we will be able to leave behind many smiling faces and a beautiful Earth for the next generation.That is what I believe and that is what we will achieve. Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT16Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataAt a Q&A session with the media after his presentation, President Akio Toyoda talked about his ideas.  \u0007Why the BEV sales forecast for 2030 has been revised upward—— What is the reason for this large upward revision from 2 million BEVs by 2030 to 3.5 million?The 2 million units mentioned by the reporter was the initial forecast Toyota announced back in May, and was, in fact, sales of zero emission vehicles, including fuel cell electric vehicles. Only seven months later, Toyota added 1.5 million more BEVs and revealed a new guideline of 3.5 million BEVs.AkioFirstly, the 2 million units of zero emission vehicles is a significant amount. Most Chinese automobile companies record roughly the same amount of vehicle sales. To that, we are adding another 1.5 million to make it 3.5 million, which is equivalent to the volumes sold by Daimler, PSA, and Suzuki Motors if they made all their vehicles BEVs. Regardless of the powertrain, whether it is a BEV or an FCEV, what matters in achieving carbon neutrality is the energy that the vehicle uses. Whether the vehicles are carbon-reducing vehicles or carbon-neutral vehicles will rely on the energy situation in each region.At COP26 this year, various countries’ policies became clear. As that happened, after revisiting our plan, we realized that we could achieve a higher level of carbon-neutral vehicles sales than previously anticipated. We came up with this revised figure after that discussion and plan review.  \u0007Is this a strictly BEV shift or part of a multi-solution approach?—— Going forward, are you going to focus more on BEVs amid a variety of other electrified vehicles? Or has your strategy of BEVs being just one part of a full lineup of electrified vehicles not changed?Toyota’s consistent approach to vehicle electrification has been a multi-solution strategy. The company has committed to offering a wide variety of products to meet diverse customer needs, instead of focusing on fewer choices.In his presentation, Akio clarified his stance on the multi-solution strategy, saying “we want to keep options available for our customers.”However, one might think that Toyota is shifting its focus to BEVs, with the upward revision of the sales volume, Lexus becoming a brand dedicated to BEVs, and the growing investment of 4 trillion yen for BEVs (including 2 trillion yen for batteries).AkioWe have made the utmost efforts toward achieving carbon neutrality, and we will continue to do so going forward.Toyota is a global company with a full lineup of products. We have seen changes in the energy situation in each country, and the way customers use vehicles is now more diversified.It is the customers, not us at Toyota, who choose which options to use. So, no solution will come from our decision alone.What we will do is have a wider range of available options, and to make serious efforts across our full lineup of options.We want to be prepared to meet customer and market expectations and preferences more quickly, and more flexibly. In this way, I believe that we will be able to enhance our competitiveness, and that is how we will be able to survive.Just because I drive a hydrogen-powered vehicle, it does not mean that I am prioritizing it over others.All of our employees, suppliers, affiliated companies, and the 5.5 million people working in the automobile industry, have made serious efforts in Japan in achieving carbon neutrality.For us at Toyota, we do business and operate worldwide, and the full lineup of products is key in our global operation. I hope you see that we are putting serious effort into this approach.  Why not pursue 100% BEVs across the whole lineup?—— As the largest carmaker in the world, why are you targeting only 35% of your current volume? Why not go for 100% or 50% as many of your competi­tors have now done? Why is 3.5 million sufficient in your mind?As Akio pointed out at the beginning, the upwardly revised figure of 3.5 million in global BEV sales is equivalent to the entirety of sales of one of the top ten automakers in the world.However, in many cases, the assessment of an auto­maker’s attitude toward BEVs is not based on the absolute number of vehicles sales, but on the sales ratio. This question reflects precisely that attitude.AkioWith a baseline toward 2030, we want to increase our carbon-neutral vehicles as much as possible.However, the energy situations in individual countries have had a big impact on the path to carbon neutrali­ty. That is the reality. I hope you understand that this is something Toyota cannot control.If no sufficient clean energy and charging infrastruc­ture exists in a market, expanding our BEVs and limiting options for customers will result in inconve­niencing customers. We want to avoid that.When we look at the global market, it is a diversified market that we are dealing with, and that is what Toyota does.Diverse solutions are necessary in diverse situations. Also, the best solution for the average person will not necessarily be the best solution for everyone.(Photo: Noriaki Mitsuhashi/N-RAK PHOTO AGENCY)Answers to Five Questions about Toyota’s BEV Strategy (Report on Media Q&A Session)“Do you like battery EVs?” Akio Toyoda’s Response Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT17Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataTherefore, as we are in uncharted territory with lots of uncertainty about the future, we want to take a diversified approach. That is why we have worked hard to maintain our full lineup. We will take on this challenge together with our suppliers, affiliated companies, and partners. That is what I would like you to understand.Toyota vehicles are used all over the world to fill various needs, not just for one particular market or one specific need.  \u0007Thoughts on preserving jobs—— Your suppliers are closely watching this ­announcement, since some of them could face major impacts. What are your thoughts on employment within the industry?Since the end of last year, in his other role as chairman of the Japan Automobile Manufacturers Associations (JAMA), Akio has pointed out that the rapid shift to BEVs would lead to risking automotive jobs.The question was about whether he has changed his stance on the employment issue as he announces this enhancement of Toyota’s BEV strategy. Akio responded to this question, expressing his passion for suppliers and, by extension, the automotive industry.AkioFirst of all, it is the market and customers who decide which carbon-neutral options to choose. This is the premise here.The numbers related to carbon neutrality that we have heard so far are goals for 2040 or 2050.We don’t want to be a company that sets an appeal­ing target but doesn’t bother trying to achieve it when the announcement is done. What we are announcing today is a bit more in the near term. Many of the cars that you are looking at right now will be launched on the market very soon.Looking at the run up to 2030, what we present today will be a good tool to start discussions and take action with various stakeholders while leaving room to imagine more what the next 8 years will be like.By presenting a guideline in the product planning area, we will be able to examine the potential impact on our suppliers or our production plants.As the chairman of JAMA, I have warned that the jobs of 1 million of the 5.5 million people employed in the automotive industry would be lost if new car sales in Japan become 100% BEVs. At that time, various companies came out with some vague target numbers and not any specific figures or road maps to achieve them.But recently we have seen more concrete plans for the near-term future from different OEMs. Now, at Toyota, we’re also coming up with very concrete plans including for models to be launched. We’ll have a renewed discussion based on this.The automotive industry accounts for 75% of the components procured from suppliers and there are tier one, tier two and tier three suppliers supporting the industry. Even if we emphasize the importance of keeping many options available, that change ­becomes a critical issue for suppliers who have until now produced only engine-related parts.We shouldn’t just say that it changed because the market chose it. I would like to make the automotive industry such that the people and companies who have been doing a certain business for a long time, no matter what kind of work they do or the size of the company, will not be disappointed about their lives and we will continue to show respect for their meaningful work.The future is not determined by the goals presented by leaders, but by purposeful passion and action. Toward the goal for carbon neutrality in 2050, the view of the future in 2050 will change depending on how we act in the next few years, five years, and ten years, and we want to make the change happen.The future will not suddenly emerge from the present; rather, the future will be created by the accumulation of present moments as they become the past. We hope that you will allow us to leave many options open in this process.It is not true that we are not fully committed because our goal is not 100%. We hope you will understand that we would very much like to continue our work in this industry.  \u0007Evaluation by environmental groups and the future of engines and BEVs—— An environmental group put Toyota at the bottom of the climate action rankings. Let me ask you again. What is Toyota’s position on BEVs? Also, what is the future plan for engine development?Last month, one environmental group ranked Toyota the lowest in its climate action ranking of automakers, which has become a major topic of discussion.From early on, Toyota has been making more efforts to promote more fuel efficient engines and electrified vehicles, including hybrid electric vehicles, to reduce CO2 emissions more than any other automaker. Currently, Toyota is in the most advantageous position to comply with strict fuel efficiency regulations, but the company received this unfortunate ranking.Akio explained Toyota’s commitment to car manufacturing.AkioIt is their ranking, so we take it seriously, but if we are still not considered proactive toward BEVs with our 3.5 million BEVs and 30 new models to come, what should we do? If that’s the case, I would like to ask them to let us know what would improve their evaluation.Things look differently if we go by percentage or by absolute numbers. Vehicles are for individual custom­ers. One vehicle, for one customer. It’s not a percent­age business, it’s the absolute numbers that we want them to look at when evaluating.No matter how many vehicles we sell, we will make and deliver them to customers one by one, without compromise.Whatever powertrain it is, or whatever type of BEV it is, Toyota and Lexus vehicles should continue to offer the value of fun to drive. We will continue to make products with the unique character of Toyota and Lexus that makes customers happy.We will continue to take proactive action for carbon neutrality. In a world where there is no right answer, we are committed to solving problems with a wide variety of options. We hope you understand that we are working really hard on every option. The speakers stressed the importance of Toyota’s multi-solution strategy while strengthening BEVs.

Personally, President Toyoda, do you like BEVs or not? If it’s difficult to respond as the president of the company, you can respond as driver Morizo.Akio is known to be a petrolhead. During a talk session at the Tokyo Motor Show 2019, while showcasing Toyota’s future concept cars at the venue, he shared his honest feelings toward engine vehicles, saying, “I like cars with wild flavors such as the smell of gasoline and a lot of noise.”As part of Toyota’s endeavor in expanding options for carbon neutrality by 2050, from May of this year, he himself has taken the wheel of a hydrogen-powered vehicle in the Super Taikyu Series races.From the perspective of fostering environmentally friendly technology, Akio sends enthusiastic encouragement to the team that has been competing in the 24 Hours of Le Mans and the WEC (FIA World Endurance Championship) with Toyota’s hybrid system from 2012.With that in mind, Akio, either as a Master Driver of Toyota or driver Morizo, has not shown a moment in which he enthusiastically enjoys driving BEVs.As most of the reporters asked questions to delve into the company’s BEV strategy, this straightforward and personal question thrown to Akio put a smile on his face, making him admit that “it’s a great question.” Akio responded as follows.AkioIf I have to answer, honestly, in the past I was not interested in Toyota’s BEVs, but I am getting interested in the BEVs that we are now developing for the future.After improving my driving skills, I test-drove a battery electric Toyota 86 for the first time here at MEGA WEB. The comment that I gave after my test drive was that “it’s an electric vehicle.”We have the Lexus brand and the Toyota brand, and we are an OEM pursuing distinctiveness in each brand. But when it comes to BEVs, the car becomes more like a commodity.I think you saw my honest feeling. Of course, I support BEVs in terms of business, but the question is whether I support them as driver Morizo.I’m a master driver, and in the training I went through back in the day, I always drove an FR vehicle.But now I participate in rally races and the Super Taikyu races. In these motorsports, I now drive a four-wheel drive vehicle as well. My sensibility as a master driver has changed with these vehicles.I now think that electric motors have higher efficiency than gasoline-only-powered vehicles. If we have a good four-wheel drive platform, it can become an FF vehicle or an FR vehicle through control technology.So, with that kind of control technology, I think Morizo will be able to drive fast and safely on any circuit or rally course.Nori-san (rally driver Norihiko Katsuta) has won the All-Japan Rally Championships this year. The professional drivers of ROOKIE Racing are very active in various motorsports circuits.Those driving skills of professional drivers are reflected in our vehicles to make them safer and more fun-to-drive. I have such expectations.At the same time, this platform has enabled us to make vehicles that allow amateur drivers like me to enjoy driving on various roads, however rough, whether it’s a mountainous road or snowy road or whatever. This is a big change in our company.Control technology plays a key role there, but it alone can’t push major improvements. If we try to create driving flavor only through control technology, it’s like adding crispy tempura to overcooked noodles.But over the past several years, starting with our Toyota New Global Architecture (TNGA) initiatives, we have made steady improvements in the vehicles’ basic frame, chassis, and body rigidity, under the banner of “let’s make ever-better cars.”We also opened the Shimoyama proving ground, and we are now testing and developing cars under these tough conditions.With this environment, I think we are now at a point where we can develop safer and faster vehicles with more fun-to-drive aspects. I look forward to develop­ing such BEVs as well moving forward.That’s why it’s not just a business matter anymore. Even as driver Morizo, I have strong expectations for and a desire to give my feedback to our development, such as “making this kind of car would be fun” or “as an automaker we want to create autonomous driving that is unique, even in an era of autonomous driving.”We will continue to make serious efforts in BEVs and other powertrains such as fuel cell electric vehicles, hybrid electric vehicles, and gasoline-only vehicles that have exciting sounds.I’m still quite serious about them as Morizo and as the president of Toyota. We’re working with our colleagues and partners very seriously in all of these fields. We want to provide customers with vehicles that can make them happy.This comment could only come from Akio, who takes the wheel himself and is responsible for the driving feel of Toyota vehicles as Master Driver and Morizo. “We will continue to make ever-better cars with BEVs” —this might be the very message that he wanted to convey the most to car enthusiasts.

These development efforts are organized by type of electrified vehicle. For HEVs, our focus is on power output, or in other words, instantaneous power, while, when it comes to PHEVs and BEVs, our focus is on capacity or what can be called “endurance.”  As for batteries for HEVs, we have been continu­ously upgrading nickel-metal hydride batteries and lithium-ion batteries, taking advantage of their respective characteristics. In particular, we took on the challenge of developing a bipolar structure in the course of creating a nickel-metal hydride battery to be installed in the Aqua, which underwent a full-scale redesign completed in July 2021, and have become the first in the world to commercialize a battery of this kind as an onboard battery for driving. Compared to the batteries used in the previous generation of the Aqua, the output density has been doubled, giving the car a powerful acceleration sensation. We are currently engaged in development aimed at creating more-advanced lithium-ion batteries by the second half of the 2020s. Striking a Balance among Five FactorsTo develop batteries that our customers can use with peace of mind, we focus on producing batteries that stand out for their “safety,” have “long service life,” boast “high-level quality,” and are “good yet affordable” as well as capable of “outstanding performance.”   For example, a longer service life affects a vehicle’s residual value. In terms of cruising range, high energy density and high-level performance are also necessary. On the other hand, over emphasis on a fast charging speed may increase the danger of overheating or even fire and thus decrease battery safety.   This concept has remained unchanged since batteries were installed in the first-generation Prius, and it applied to all the batteries in all of our electrified vehicles.  Although Toyota is committed to balancing the five factors, too much emphasis on one could be detrimental to the others. That’s why we believe that the integrated development of batteries and vehicles is essential.   How batteries are used depends on how the vehicles in which they are installed are used. For example, the environments in which vehicles are operated differ according to each vehicle’s mode of use, for example, if it is being used as a taxi or for commuting, as well as geographic location, and these factors will affect such conditions as charging frequency and battery temperature. Accordingly, we carry out mock driving tests that assume a diverse range of vehicle usage in order to obtain data on actual usage environments and provide feedback to inform the evaluation and design of batteries.   To determine the balancing point of the five factors discussed above, it is necessary to obtain driving data that includes driving conditions and usage environments, find out what the conditions would be like if batteries were used instead, and repeatedly verify what is happening inside the batteries. Such steady and earnest efforts for both batteries and vehicles are the secret behind Toyota’s advantages.Toyota’s Efforts for Batteries That Enable Peace of MindHere, we introduce three examples of the effort required to produce batteries that can be used safely, using lithium-ion batteries as the focus of our explanation.   The first example is about our pursuit of safety. It is known that each battery cell shows signs of localized abnormal heat generation during spirited driving or other driving that places a large load on the battery. By analyzing the phenomena occur­ring inside the battery and conducting a vast number of model experiments, we have been able to clarify the effect of driving style on the battery, as well as the mechanism of this effect. Based on the results, we have been able to detect signs of abnormal local heating of cells through multiple monitoring of voltage, current, and temperature of individual cells, blocks of cells, and the entire battery pack. The battery is then controlled to prevent abnormal heat generation. We adhere to our concept of ensuring safety, security, and reliability right down to the local areas within each battery when it comes to BEV systems.  The second example is our commitment to long service life. We have applied the technologies that we have cultivated through the development of batteries for HEVs to PHEVs, and the batteries in the C-HR BEV have a much higher capacity retention rate after 10 years than the batteries hitherto used in our PHEVs. Furthermore, for the Toyota bZ4X, which is scheduled to be launched in mid-2022, we have set a target of 90 percent endurance performance,* which is one of the highest in the world, and we are currently finalizing our development efforts to achieve it.* \u0007This represents a target value for a model in the development process and does not indicate the performance of vehicles to be released. In addition, the figure applies only to a vehicle that has operated for 10 years or been driven 150,000 miles (240,000 kilometers).    The third example has to do with our efforts to achieve high-level quality. If metallic foreign matter enters a battery during the manufacturing process and causes a direct electrical connection between the anode and cathode, the possibility of product failure increases. To address this issue, we con­firm the shape, composition, size, and possible effect on endurance of every piece of foreign matter that could enter during the manufacturing Current collectorSeparatorAnodeCathodeCase\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT20Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate Dataprocess, and we clarify how that item may affect the battery. Based on this analysis, we are ­extremely attentive to the size and shape of foreign matter, and we are managing processes in a way that is aimed at preventing the generation or entry of relevant foreign matter.Halving Battery Costs through the Integrated Development of Vehicles and BatteriesTo popularize BEVs, we strive to reduce costs via the integrated development of vehicles and batteries to provide BEVs at a reasonable price.  To start with, we aim to reduce the costs of batteries themselves by 30% or more by develop­ing materials and structures. Then, for the vehicle, we aim to improve power consumption, which is an indicator of the amount of electricity used per unit of distance, by 30%, starting with the Toyota bZ4X. Improved power efficiency leads to reduced requirements for battery capacity, which will result in a cost reduction.   Through this integrated development of vehicles and batteries, we aim to reduce the battery cost per vehicle by 50% compared to the Toyota bZ4X in the second half of the 2020s. Using Solid-State Batteries Starting with HEVsIn the near future, the energy density of conventional lithium-ion batteries per unit of weight is expected to see its peak. Accordingly, vigorous efforts are now under way to develop next-generation lithium-ion batteries, aiming to achieve longer service life, greater energy density, more compact size, and lower costs. At Toyota, we push ahead with the development of such batteries by employing the following three approaches.   For liquid batteries, which use liquid electrolyte, we are taking on the challenge of realizing “mate­rial evolution” and “structural innovation.” At the same time, we are aiming to commercialize all-solid-state batteries that employ solid electro­lyte instead of liquid electrolyte. As such, our wide-ranging development efforts are aimed at creating three types of batteries, and by the ­second half of the 2020s, we hope to improve the characteristics of each type so that we can provide batteries that can be used with peace of mind.   With regard to all-solid-state batteries, we promote development aimed at achieving higher output, longer cruising range, and shorter charging times. In June 2020, we built a vehicle equipped with all-solid-state batteries and conducted test runs on a test course to obtain driving data. Based on that data, we continued to make improvements, and in August 2020, we obtained license plate registration for vehicles equipped with all-solid-state batteries and conducted test drives.   In the course of the development process, we discovered that the fast movement of ions within all-solid-state batteries could possibly enable them to achieve higher output. On the other hand, it was revealed that these batteries tend to ­deteriorate faster due to the formation of gaps within the solid electrolyte, posing an issue of shorter service life. Therefore, we need to continue development, mainly of solid electrolyte materials.  We will start the introduction of all-solid-state batteries with those for HEVs as these vehicles require high output. We have also accumulated a wealth of know-how regarding HEVs. We will release these batteries to the market as soon as possible in order to gain customer feedback and continue to improve them.Flexible Battery Supply With the rapid expansion of EV usage, we are working to build a flexible system that can stably supply the required volume of batteries at the required time while meeting the needs of various customers in each region around the world.  To this end, we will establish needed technologies by conducting a certain amount of in-house produc­tion in the pursuit of our battery development ­concept of achieving batteries that can be used with peace of mind. We will then cooperate and ­collaborate with partners who understand and will put into practice our concept. We will also proceed with discussions with new partners in some regions.   Our approach to production within the Group can be described as “starting up using small basic units.” This approach draws on lessons learned from the global financial crisis. It is difficult to notice latent risks when production is growing. Because of this, we have to take a risk-controlled approach to growth based on Toyota’s philosophy of “making only what is needed, when it is need­ed, and only in the amount needed.”   For example, the production of all-solid-state batteries will start with batteries for HEVs, which Core electrification technologiesSecurityBattery developmentVehicle developmentGreater than 30% reduction in cost of a single battery 30% improvement in power efficiency = 30% reduction in battery capacity (30% cost reduction)• \u0007Development of low-cost materials: cobalt-free, nickel-free, and new electrode materials • \u0007Manufacturing process innovation: New development of battery manufacturing processes and battery material processes• \u0007New structure: Integrated structure of battery cells and packs to match the vehicle • \u0007Evolution of battery control model: Fuller use of battery capacity with focus on safety, security, and long service lifeAchieve the following by utilizing and developing technologies cultivated through the production of 18.1 million electrified vehicles: • \u0007Reduction of vehicle driving resistance to suit electrified vehicles • \u0007Further expansion of energy regeneration • \u0007Optimal energy/thermal management of entire vehicle and components • \u0007Optimally efficient design and control of entire powertrain systemAiming to create safe batteries that can be used with peace of mind always and for their entire lifetime, have high resale value, and contribute to the building of a resource-recycling societyGiving electrified vehicles meaning through dissemination Increasing customer choiceElectric motorse-fuel  BiofuelBatteriesPower control unitsFuel cell stacks High-pressure hydrogen tanksEnginesChargers CO2-free fuelTechnologies Supporting Full Lineup of Electrified Vehicles Toyota Concept for Battery DevelopmentUniversally applied to HEV, PHEV, BEV and FCEV batteries Next-generation BEVsBattery Cost Targets: Integrated Vehicle-battery DevelopmentRAV4 L EVRAV4 EVC-HR/IZOATOYOTA bZ series  First model: Toyota bZ4XC-HR/IZOATOYOTA bZ4XFuture BEVs30%Highly balancing 5 factors to provide reliable batteriesA unique Toyota BEV that utilizes technology cultivated through years of HEV development FCEVBEVPHEVHEVSafetyLong service lifeHigh level of qualityAffordable, high-quality products High-level perfor­mancePower efficiencykWh/kmTo be launched by mid-2022201920121996 Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT21Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataBYD subsidiary: Transferred relevant project in 2021we have been developing for years and that require a small battery volume, rather than building a massive production line for batteries for BEVs, which require a larger volume of batteries. This will not only enable us to accelerate the release of the products but also position us to better focus on improving manufacturing technologies. Moreover, Toyota’s strategy of “starting up using small basic units” is also meant to enable the company to swiftly respond to changes arising from the arrival of a new technology, which often occurs in the course of a product cycle when the manufacturing costs for the old model come down and stabilize. Batteries for 260,000 BEVs Can Reduce CO2 Emissions 20 Times More if Used in HEVsSince the introduction of the first-generation Prius in 1997, Toyota has also introduced PHEVs, FCEVs, and BEVs, while improving their perfor­mance. Over the course of more than 20 years, our cumulative sales of HEVs have reached 18.1 million units as of July 2021.   According to a Toyota estimate, the CO2 emissions reduction effect of three HEVs is equivalent to the reduction effect of one BEV. Accordingly, the 18.1 million HEVs sold to date are equivalent to the CO2 reduction effect of introducing to the market about 5.5 million BEVs. The volume of batteries for HEVs that we have produced so far is the same as that of the batteries installed on about 260,000 BEVs. In other words, we can say that the batteries needed for 260,000 BEVs have been used to achieve the CO2 ­emissions reduction effect of 5.5 million BEVs. Developing FCEVs to Realize an Ideal Vehicle In the field of fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), we released the completely redesigned Mirai in December 2020. Premised on the use of an FCEV system, the development of the second genera­tion Mirai was promoted to deliver a futuristic premium car that will be genuinely appreciated and sought after by our customers. Specifically, we strove to deliver a vehicle that can win drivers’ hearts during and after driving, if not from the moment when they first catch sight of it.   Moreover, Toyota aims to become a fuel cell (FC) system supplier supporting the realization of a hydrogen-powered society. In line with this aim, we provide a variety of business operators with a compact FC system module package that we have developed. This package consists of FC stacks for the second-generation Mirai, which boast higher performance, as well as air supply, hydrogen supply, cooling, power control and other FC system-related parts.  In North America, we have unveiled a new prototype for an FC commercial heavy-duty truck that uses the second-generation FC system installed on the new Mirai. This truck boasts considerably improved performance, including more powerful acceleration and flexible driving response. Furthermore, having attained a ­maximum loaded weight of 80,000 pounds (approximately 36 tons) and cruising range of 300 miles (more than 480 kilometers), the truck is designed to accommodate a range of commercial truck needs. We will conduct the verification testing of this new FC truck in actual cargo transport operations. Utilizing “e-Fuel” Made of HydrogenToward achieving carbon neutrality, we are also considering a revolutionary approach expected to enable us to drastically curb CO2 emissions through the combination of such “carbon-neutral fuel” as “e-Fuel” made of hydrogen and biofuel, with high-efficiency engine and motor technolo­gies. Not only is the above approach practicable via the use of existing infrastructure, it could help us reduce CO2 emissions from all types of vehi­cles currently being used.  For example, when gasoline vehicles are fed gasoline mixed with a certain amount of “e-Fuel,” the volume of their CO2 emissions declines to a level on par with emissions from HEVs. The mix of “e-Fuel” in gasoline will similarly curb the volume of CO2 emissions from HEVs to a level on par with PHEVs. Even PHEVs can benefit from the use of “e-Fuel,” which will help reduce their CO2 ­emissions to be close to emissions from BEVs.

While fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) are driven by electric motors powered using electricity generated by a chemical reaction between hydrogen and airborne oxygen, vehicles powered by hydrogen engines get their zoom by directly burning hydrogen as fuel in a modified conventional gasoline engine setup. The fuel is 100-percent pure hydrogen, unmixed with gasoline. As no fossil fuels are burned, except for the combustion of minute amounts of engine oil during driving, hydrogen engine vehicles emit nearly no CO2 when in operation. To realize carbon neutrality, it will be important to increase people’s options without losing sight of the goal.  Hydrogen engine technology, which draws on many decades of tried and tested internal com­bustion engine technology, holds the major hidden possibility of contributing to carbon neutrality. It is one option for safeguarding engine-related ­employment in Japan’s auto industry.  At the end of 2020, Master Driver Morizo (President Akio Toyoda, using his race driver name) swiftly came to a decision: he would drive a prototype vehicle, enter the 2021 Super Taikyu Series race, and thereby train on the front line of motorsports. Development in motorsports takes place on a much shorter timeline than it does for mass-produced automobiles. It is also more flexible. To realize carbon neutrality, we determined that motorsports is the most appropriate venue for training on and developing hydrogen engines.  To realize carbon neutrality, we need to expand options for creating, distributing, and using energy, and cooperation with a wide range of companies will be indispensable. While training with the hydrogen engine at the 2021 Super Taikyu Series, we gained many friends with the requisite will and passion for such collaboration.  In May, the third 24-hour race held in Fuji took on the challenge of using alternative energy. The Super Taikyu institution supported our racing with a hydrogen engine. We were able to complete the 24-hour race with the cooperation of many supporters, including Denso Corporation, which collaborated with us on the development of basic parts; Iwatani Corporation and Taiyo Nippon Sanso Corporation, which collaborated on the supply of hydrogen; and FH2R in Namie-cho, Fukushima Prefecture.   At the fourth race held in Oita, we worked to expand options for creating energy. We used hydrogen that was refined using the geothermal power of Obayashi Corporation in Kokonoe, Oita Prefecture, and the photovoltaic power of Toyota Motor Kyushu’s Miyata Plant in Miyawaka, Fukuoka Prefecture.  At the fifth race held in Suzuka in September, we took on the challenge of energy distribution. We used hydrogen derived from Australian brown coal in collaboration with Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Iwatani Corporation, and Electric Power Development.  In Japan, hydrogen is shipped in small fuel cell (FC) trucks, made by Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies ( see page 28), and Toyota Transportation’s biofuel trucks. Options for distributing energy within Japan have expanded as have those for distributing energy overseas.  At the sixth (and final) race held in Okayama in November, we made further progress on building partnerships for expanding fuel options for internal combustion engines. In cooperation with Kawasaki Heavy Industries, SUBARU, Mazda, and Yamaha Motor, we announced that we would try to (1) enter races using carbon-neutral engines (Mazda: using next-generation bio-diesel fuel) (SUBARU, Toyota: using bio-mass derived synthetic fuel and entering the 2022 Super Taikyu Series) and (2) consider using hydrogen engines for two-wheeled vehicles (Kawasaki Heavy Industries, Yamaha Motor: began considering joint research). Furthermore, in joint research for hydrogen engines with an eye toward installing them in two-wheeled vehicles, four companies (including Honda Motor and Suzuki) will continue searching for possible ways to realize carbon neutrality.   In this way, the auto industry will become a pacesetter promoting initiatives that play to industry strengths while aiming for the realization of a ­carbon-neutral society. Through this such inten­tional application of passion and action, the future vision for the next 10 to 20 years will evolve. With courage and determination, we can shape this future vision and continue to take on challenges and go beyond the industry borders going forward.Building a Carbon-neutral Future Is an Intentional Passion and ActionWhy Race with a Hydrogen Engine Not Yet Ready for Sale Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT23Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataInitiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality: Monozukuri (manufacturing)Manufacturing has long been the main driving force behind Japan’s industrial development. However, we cannot take it for granted that Japan’s strength in manufacturing will last forever. This strength, which has been nurtured over many decades, could be lost for good if we fail to hold on to it. Japan is an earthquake-prone country, and its manufacturing prowess has been refined by adversity. In truth, Japan’s manufacturers have been made even stronger by overcoming one natural disaster after another.   When the Great East Japan Earthquake struck in 2011, our plants and equipment suffered grave damage due to the unprecedented scale of the disaster, and the restoration of their operations took a long time. However, having gone through this trial, we have become even better at minimiz­ing disaster damage through the emergency handling of equipment and immediate crisis response in other areas.  When the COVID-19 pandemic forced auto­makers to suspend production in 2020, we voluntarily started to produce masks, face shields, and foot-operated disinfectant application devic­es. We also employed our TPS (Toyota Production System) to assist in the production of such goods as medical gowns. In sum, it was proven that our response to emergencies has become prompter and more proactive.   When a fire broke out at a semiconductor parts manufacturing plant in 2021 and forced it to halt production, we pulled together to support its restoration efforts. With our teams in charge of parts procurement and equipment manufacturing demonstrating outstanding collaboration, the damaged equipment was reconstructed in two months. We thus accomplished a difficult task that would otherwise require at least seven months.   Monozukuri (manufacturing) is about developing people. It is not an exaggeration to say that Japan, which turns hardships into strengths, is an optimal place for manufacturing.A Path toward a “Green Factory”Toyota is currently taking on the challenge of creating a “green factory” on various fronts to realize a target of reducing the volume of CO2 emissions from its plants worldwide to zero, that is, achieving carbon neutrality, by 2035.   Our commitment to the above target was announced in June 2021.    We believe that striving for carbon neutrality presents an opportunity to fundamentally innovate manufacturing.Technological Development Aimed at Contributing to Carbon NeutralityFor example, we are engaged in technological development that makes full use of new ideas.   Painting and casting are the most carbon-­intensive automobile manufacturing processes. Based on new ideas, we are taking on technological development focused on decarbonizing the above two processes.   Conventional air-spray technologies are ­designed to deposit paint over broad areas. Moreover, with the air blown toward the target surface rebounding off it and scattering paint particles, only approximately 70% of the paint being sprayed successfully adheres to the target surface, while the remaining 30% goes waste. To eliminate such waste, our airless painting machines take advantage of the world’s first technology that uses static electricity to cause fine paint particles to adhere to the target surface. This technology enables us to achieve a coating adhesion efficiency of more than 95%. Furthermore, having combined this technology with the innovative concept of a rotating paint ejection head, we have made it possible to create even finer paint particles with minimal variation in size, thereby achieving even higher painting quality. In addition to curbing CO2 emissions from our manufacturing operations via the introduction of airless painting machines, we are also able to reduce the size of paint recovery equipment as the volume of waste paint is consid­erably smaller. Thus, airless painting machines will help us achieve a significant reduction in the volume of CO2 emissions.  Also, in an effort to upgrade the press molding process for body panels, we are striving to make use of in-mold coating technology in which paint is applied to body panel parts as they are shaped within the metal press molds. The integration of press molding and painting into one process is an epoch-making idea that could eliminate the conventional painting process.   Other new ideas include replacing paint with adhesive film, effectively eliminating the painting process. Adhesive films can be customized to make them special, and they can also be replaced for fun. Drawing on this idea, we intend to take on a new business in which we renovate used vehicles, make them look fantastic, and offer them to the users of the KINTO subscription service.

Toyota Chief Production Officer Says “No”Taking on the Challenge of Embodying Skilled Manufacturing, a Key to the Future Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT24Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataKarakuri for Non-powered DevicesWe wonder if some of our readers have heard of chahakobi dolls, tea-serving dolls manufactured in the Edo period. Such mechanical dolls, designed to carry cups of tea to guests and collect empty cups, perform combinations of simple fundamental movements (karakuri) and can be considered a precursor to robots. The Japanese term karakuri generally refers to non-powered mechanical automata operating through a combination of gears and shafts. They can therefore be deemed the ultimate carbon-neutral devices.   At Toyota’s Honsha Plant, we maintain a pro­duction line called the TPS basic line. This facility was built upon our predecessors’ wisdom as well as our ingenuity. In fact, going back to the con­cept of karakuri, we have created an automated line that does not use sensors or control devices.   The use of karakuri is intended to nurture human sensibilities and inform our development of equipment. For example, because at each stage a karakuri mechanism must work properly for the next action to occur, such mechanisms make it easy to detect problems without relying on sensors.  At Toyota, we replace pallets containing produc­tion parts via non-powered operation, using this mechanism in combination with automated conveyance carts to achieve an unmanned process.Collaboratively Employing the Latest Technologies and the TPSToyota’s efforts to create a “green factory” are being promoted by collaboratively employing the latest technologies and the TPS.  The first technology is automated conveyance. At Toyota, transporting, itself, is considered wasteful. The starting point is trying to not ­transport at all. But, as that can often not be done, if something needs to be transported from point A to point B, we revise facility layouts to shorten the distance between the two locations while reducing the bulk of cargo and number of items per load. We then develop an automated conveyance system covering only the remaining distance and carrying lightest possible loads.   In Woven City, a similar concept is utilized, in which above ground and underground roads are developed separately, with the latter used only by fully automated logistics vehicles for the purpose of goods distribution.    The second technology is automated inspection using AI. There are many examples in the world of automated inspection of defective products using machine learning to reduce the need for human labor. However, our goal is to use the vast amount of data we are collecting from this process to make essential improvements that will prevent defects from occurring in the first place.   The third technology has to do with digital transformation (DX) and IoT. With regard to IoT, a technology that connects nearly everything to the internet, we have experienced setbacks despite our best efforts to become a forerunner in the rush toward IoT. Although we raised the equipment utilization rate on production lines to 98% by pursuing continuous improvement and applying the TPS, there remains the problem of how to address the last 2%. It is a real problem that can only be solved by the power of people. Toyota believes that people should not be turned into machine-keepers. To get that final 2%, we aim to simplify equipment and create equipment that does not break down.  By combining this unique, human-centered, Toyota thinking with DX and IoT, we hope to create the next generation of advanced ­production lines.   In 2019, we launched a vehicle production line that collaboratively employs the latest technologies and the TPS in Mexico (see the diagram below). Taking Full Advantage of the Power of Monozukuri (manufacturing) Unparalleled by Global Peers In the face of a forthcoming wave of new chal­lenges, such as calls for carbon neutrality and the need for DX, we at Toyota stand with our fellow manufacturers around the world. Working hand in hand with them, we will take on these challenges and become the best automaker in town in each region in which we operate.

Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT25Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataAmid this once-in-a-century era defined by major CASE* transformation, automobile manufacturing requires technological development in such new fields as electrification, automated driving, and connectivity. Among these fields, software is becoming an important factor in determining product appeal.  Today’s cars are equipped with more than 50 electronic control units, or ECUs, and use as many as 1,000 chips. Furthermore, society has entered the age of the internet of things, and things being connected has become the norm. Cars are also equipped with communication devices, further advancing their electronification, and the volume of software (lines of code) is thus growing ever larger.  Facing this major transformation in the auto industry, Toyota is paying particular attention to the transition of cell phones. As the shoulder phone evolved into the feature phone and then into the smartphone, the commoditized product of the phone became linked with information, creating new value through new experiences and quickly spreading around the world. This transition is supported by software and connected technologies.  Due to the CASE revolution, cars are becoming more deeply connected to communities and people’s lives through information, becoming a more integral part of social systems. At the same time, cars will become more linked to information, and through the movement of people, goods, and things, Toyota aims to provide new value through new experiences and by bringing excitement to customers.* \u0007CASE: Connected, Autonomous, Shared, Electric. The technological revolution in these new fields is expected to speed up and continue changing cars, and, by extension, mobility and the structure of society. As a mobility company that can provide a wide array of services related to mobility and meet diverse needs, Toyota is working to realize the mobility society of the future.Focusing on the Real World and InternalizationWhen it comes to the manufacturing of cars, Toyota has a basic stance that has been handed down internally over the years: we stick to our principles and internalize important elements by attempting to first achieve them on our own. We also continuously introduce improvements on the front lines to enhance our competitive advantage.  Since its founding, Toyota has been producing various production equipment in-house as neces­sary. In the 1990s, we pursued the in-house design of ECUs and established an electronics plant, a chip plant, and a battery plant. These efforts eventually led to the commercialization of the Prius, the world’s first mass-produced hybrid electric vehicle (HEV).  Toyota has always maintained a strong aware­ness of the real world regardless of the era at hand, pursued our principles, and promoted internalization. That is why in the area of software and connected technologies, we established the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), Woven Planet Holdings, and Toyota Connected, and it is why we are working on the development of the e-Palette, the construction of Woven City as a town for pilot testing, and the development of the Arene ­platform and other technologies.Progress on Connected Cars and Connected TechnologiesTo date, Toyota has sold 10 million Lexus and Toyota vehicles that are connected cars, mainly in Japan, the United States, Europe, and China.  Toyota’s vision of the connected car is not simply one of connecting the car to the internet. Rather, it is about providing customers with emotional experiences through the movement of people, goods, and activities—a vision centered on people that we call “human connected.”   To achieve this, we are operating a call center as a point of contact with customers; the Toyota Smart Center, which provides a variety of ­services; and the Toyota Big Data Center, which utilizes vehicle information gathered from cars. In addition, we have established the Mobility Service Platform (MSPF) to provide mobility services and are promoting collaboration with service providers.  Connected cars and connected technologies will be applied to a variety of areas, and that which is to be connected will expand to include people, cars, communities, and society (business-to-society, or BtoS). Toyota will handle the information gathered from customers and vehicles with care, utilizing it for the happiness of customers and the develop­ment of society while creating new value from experiences centered on mobility.  With the e-Palette battery electric vehicle (BEV) used in the Olympic Village for the Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020, our goal was to create mobility that integrates cars and information and that coordinates with the community. During the Games, 49,000 athletes, staff, and volunteers used e-Palette. We also developed a fleet ­management system for e-Palettes based on the principles of the Toyota Production System (TPS) to ensure effective, efficient, and accurate opera­tion. The system monitors the vehicles remotely and operates them in a just-in-time fashion according to the conditions of the surrounding Software and Connected InitiativesConnectedAutonomousElectricSharedHow Toyota Is Taking on Car-making Going ForwardToyota’s Key to Software Survival: In-House Capability and Real Customer ContactService ProvidersMobility Services Platform (MSPF)Toyota Smart Center (TSC)Global Communications PlatformInsurance companiesCar-sharingTaxisRetailGovt. offices, Olympics & ParalympicsRideshareRentalsLogisticsFood & lodgingAPI (Vehicle management, fleet management, authentication functions, payment functions, etc.)Telematics insuranceOTA updates of onboard softwareSmart Key Box/TransLogTelematics services (map updates, agents...)Flexible leasingIndividual/device authentificationVehicle informationUse of big data (CRM quality control)Operational informationBig data (TBDC)Operator-assisted services Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT26Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataAutomatically sentto the garage inthe event of an abnormalityImmediate development of replacement vehiclesEmergency remote vehicle stop/restartenvironment and the number of passengers. All of this was realized via the MSPF that Toyota has been building and refining.   In the future, these technologies will be applied to the Sienna Autono-MaaS minivan being devel­oped in the United States for use as a robotaxi, and the MSPF will be used not only for automated vehicles, but also for regular commercial vehicles and logistics.Innovation through a New Mobility Software PlatformIn this way, software has the power to promptly turn ideas into products. The aim of Arene, the vehicle development platform that Toyota and Woven Planet are focused on, is to continue fundamentally changing the development of software for vehicles.  The most notable characteristics of Arene are that it absorbs the differences in vehicle hardware specifications (abstraction) and employs hardware abstraction layers (HAL) that enable hardware to be controlled with universal methods. This, in turn, enables the independent development of hardware and software as well as the reuse of software. Arene leverages the strengths of hardware cultivat­ed by Toyota to achieve the development of safe, high-quality, and advanced software.  Because increasingly complicated software development is becoming a bottleneck for cars, too, there is a need for a revolutionary vehicle OS that can solve these issues. The vehicle OS will achieve TPS in software development as well, and we must continue to realize combinations of good hardware and software.  For example, when developing automated driving software, the on-board software needed for automated driving actually makes up only 10%; the other 90% comprises various tools, such as data processing by the machine learning system, mounting, code review, software updates, log analyses, and simulations. Basically, most of the software we develop is used off-board (out­side vehicles) or through the cloud.  Arene is used to develop frameworks for vehicle development and development environments based on those frameworks as well as to build ecosystems for mobility development. Using industry-leading software technologies, we will continue providing privacy-conscious, secure, and safe cars.  Furthermore, application development on Arene is also easy. Partner companies will be able to program applications more efficiently using the Arene’s application programming interface (API, a mechanism that can share software functions) and software development kit (SDK), which includes simulation environments.  In this way, development on Arene swiftly realizes commercialization and enables users to share the fun of providing new ideas that appeal to customers while meeting the expectations of worldwide partners and developers as well as the Toyota brand’s high-quality standards.  The portion of a car’s value attributable to software is growing. By internalizing the parts central to Toyota’s future, we will strategically ensure the strengths of our hardware and software through internal production, compartmentalize development undertaken with partners, and accelerate the speed of mass production.  For these initiatives, we are building a software development structure on a 3,000-person scale for Toyota, Woven Planet, and Toyota Connected and on a 18,000-person scale for the entire Group. We are also strengthening the teams responsible for the internal production and ­development of software.Geofencing Technology Expands the Possibilities of HEVs and PHEVsThrough connected technologies, we can contribute to carbon neutrality by gaining a better under­standing of the characteristics of each region in the form of data and combining this knowledge with realized technologies.  According to market data, in Japan, the engine is turned off for half of all driving time in hybrid electric vehicles, or HEVs, while for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, or PHEVs, the engine is turned off for as much as 80 percent. HEVs and PHEVs can evolve into environment-friendly vehicles to an even higher degree by upgrading the switching control of engines and electric motors. In other words, there is room to expand the possibilities of both HEVs and PHEVs.  One mechanism that will enable this is geofenc­ing technology. A portmanteau of geography and Fleet Management System Based on the Toyota Production System (TPS)Aiming for the ultimate in “just-in-time mobility,” e-Palettes are dispatched “when needed, where needed, and in the amount needed.”Real LifeNew Features, Services, and FunctionalityVirtual1  Waiting customers increase2  \u0007Additional unit dispatched in real time3  \u0007Prevents variation in operation intervalsAMMS (Operation management center)Application Programmable Interface (API)Arene Tools(Simulation Environment)Arene Operating System (OS)Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL)Autonomy ApplicationsInfotainmentOther Applications Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT27Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate Datafence, geofencing refers to the combination of navigation and cloud technologies to enable the automatic switching of engine and motor functions in real time to reflect driving locations and driving times based on geographic data. For example, in zero-emission regulation regions that limit vehicle operation to only battery electric vehicles (BEVs) during certain time periods, geofencing automati­cally controls the functions of HEVs and PHEVs to ensure compliance with regulations.  Furthermore, geofencing enables anticipatory eco-driving that switches over to BEV driving as appropriate by predicting the driving burden based on the driving environment up to the destination. Utilizing connected technologies makes it possible to further promote energy saving in cars the smart control of HEVs and PHEVs.  The new NX features a mechanism that switch­es to HEV control. We expect that in the near future it will be able to use geofencing technology with over-the-air (OTA) update of its software.  In October 2021, in advance of introducing geofencing technology under development with an eye toward practical application, we introduced anticipatory eco-driving (anticipatory EV/HEV mode switching control) in the Japanese market. It realizes highly efficient driving by automatically switching between EV and HEV modes depend­ing on the charge left in the battery and the road conditions and characteristics.Continuing to Evolve through Software UpdatesOTA refers to using wireless connections to continuously update to the latest software (control software and high-precision mapping software). This means that after a car’s purchase, new functions continue to be added and performance enhanced, while the latest driving assistance technol­ogy is installed, thereby continuing the vehicle’s evolution into a safer and more secure car.  For the LS and Mirai launched in Japan in April 2021, we have included cars that feature the latest Advanced Drive function of the newest sophisticated driving assistance technologies developed by Toyota Teammate/Lexus Teammate, and they are eligible for related software updates on an ongoing basis.  The GR Yaris “Morizo Selection” is a new initiative based on GR Yaris that combines the ROOKIE Racing privateer team run by Morizo (President Akio Toyoda’s racing driver name) and Toyota’s KINTO car subscription.  We will continue to evolve each car to best match each customer by reflecting updates (which are based on feedback and data gained in races participated in by Morizo and ROOKIE Racing) and personalization (which is based on customer driving data) in the software in GR Garage shops. Furthermore, we offer better driving methods and support the enhancement of driving skills. Basically, we realize cars that evolve to suit people by updating the latest software in line with each customer.Note: \u0007These updates are not OTA. They are done through a wired connection at stores.The Auto Industry Going Forward and the Possibility of CarsCars have a wide range of applications from passenger cars to MaaS and commercial vehicles, and we will continue to expand the regions where we operate going forward. Needs are increasingly diversifying, and cars can be used in a myriad of ways to meet them. Our efforts thus encompass people’s problems and social issues, smiles and joy, and needed technological development.  The auto industry must move people while also achieving coexistence with local communities. For the future and for children, the Toyota Group is working on producing happiness for all through freedom of movement for all and the provision of exciting experiences.  We will continue to enhance the excitement that can be experienced by being able to move by combining real cars and the power of software. If we combine innovation with technology, the value of cars will rise higher. We will also contribute to the further development of society by going beyond the borders of cars and contributing to community building and the creation of society-wide platforms.HEV drivingBEV drivingHEV drivingHEV driving for accelerationHEV driving for climbing hillsBEV driving for frequent starts & stopsBEV drivingfor the remaining distanceHEV drivingHEV drivingBEV drivingBEV drivingRegenerative chargingMountainous areaUrban areaAnticipation of drivingburden on the environmentCarSoftware download managementSoftware version managementConnected baseFeeSoftware quality managementSoftware download quality managementDownloaded software• Vehicle    condition• Software    version, etc.Region-speciﬁc needs010100001010010010010100001010010010010100001010010010010100001010010010255075100(%)0HEVPHEVEngine + BEV driving          BEV during stops          BEV drivingSupport for driving in cities that have zero-emission regulations(Geofencing technology)Switch to electric-vehicle mode based on driving environment (Anticipatory eco-driving)Energy ConservationRate of Engine Being Off During DrivingRate of Engine Being Off During DrivingHarmony between Society and Cars59%83% Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT28Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataCommercial Sector InitiativesCommercial Japan PartnershipImproving logistics efficiency and energy managementVehicle electrification (FCEVs, BEVs, etc.) Aiming to Improve Logistics and Lives of People: Toyota’s New Collaboration with Suzuki and DaihatsuCEOs on Why Toyota, Isuzu, and Hino Formed CASE PartnershipContributing to Carbon Neutrality through Electrification and Enhanced Logistics Efficiency Last-mile transport (capillaries)Secondary and intermediate transport (arteries)Primary and trunk line transport (main arteries)Isuzu, Hino, and Toyota Accelerate Commercial Vehicle CASE InitiativesOn March 24, 2021, Toyota, Isuzu Motors Limited, and Hino Motors, Ltd. agreed to form a new partnership in commercial vehicles and established Commercial Japan Partnership Technologies (CJPT) to promote this partnership. CASE tech­nologies can only contribute to society once they become widespread. Commercial vehicles can play important roles in CASE technology dissemi­nation, as they travel long distances for extended periods of time to support the economy and society and can be easily linked with infrastructure development. By combining the commercial vehicle foundations cultivated by Isuzu and Hino with Toyota’s CASE technologies, the companies aim to accelerate the societal implementation and adoption of CASE technologies and services and thereby help address social issues and contribute to the realization of carbon neutrality.   Specifically, the three companies are jointly working on the development of battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs), autonomous driving technologies, and electronic platforms centered on the domain of small ­commercial-purpose trucks. While working together on BEVs and FCEVs to reduce vehicle costs, the companies plan to advance infrastructure-­coordinated societal implementation, such as introducing FCEV trucks to hydrogen-based society demonstrations in Japan’s Fukushima Prefecture, thereby building an implementation model for a city with a population of 300,000 people before endeavoring to apply this model in the many similar-sized cities nationwide. Furthermore, working toward carbon neutrality, in addition to promoting the spread of electrified vehicles that are suited to logistics uses, the companies will work to increase transport efficiency based on the Just-in-Time (JIT) logistics approach of delivering what is needed, when it is needed, in the amount needed, expanding the range of the options for achieving carbon neutrality.Partnership with IsuzuWorking together, Isuzu and Hino are able to reach 80 percent of Japan’s truck customers and learn about their real needs and concerns. Distribution by truck accounts for about 90 percent of overland logistics in Japan, and the transporta­tion sector (including buses and taxis) involves 2.7 million people. Commercial vehicles account for about 40 percent of total distance traveled by automobiles and about half of all CO2 emissions from automobiles in Japan. Furthermore, the more than 60,000 logistics companies operating in Japan currently face numerous management issues, such as high-frequency distribution, harsh work ­environments, labor shortages, and rising burdens. The power of CASE, centered on connected technologies and services, is expected to deliver improvements that help resolve these issues.   Solving these kinds of social issues is not something that one company can accomplish alone. It is necessary to seek a wide range of like-minded partners, apply their different strengths, and work together for the sake of those supporting transportation and for society. As solutions to such issues progress, we expect work in overland transport to become more appealing, leading to an increase in the number of drivers and other logistics professionals.Expanding into the Commercial Minivehicle BusinessOn July 21, 2021, Suzuki Motor Corporation and Daihatsu Motor Co., Ltd. joined the Commercial Japan Partnership (CJP), a commercial vehicle project started by Toyota, Isuzu and Hino. Minivehicles account for about 31 million of the approximately 78 million vehicles owned in Japan. Furthermore, 85 percent of Japan’s roads are so narrow that only minivehicles can easily use them. In this sense, minivehicles are collectively a kind of “people’s car,” made to suit the roads of Japan. They are a practical and sustainable lifeline for people across the country and have continued to evolve alongside changing lifestyles. For more than 60 years, Suzuki and Daihatsu have been protecting this lifeline and driving forward the market. By working together, these two companies will be able to access the real needs and con­cerns of nearly 70 percent of Japan’s minivehicle users. Commercial minivehicles, which account for 58 percent of all commercial vehicles in Japan, are able to effectively cover areas that their small size makes accessible, supporting logistics operations mainly in the last mile.   Expanding the CJP-based partnership to include minivehicles will enable efficient, integrated logistics, linking the main arteries of logistics (handled by trucks) with the capillaries of logistics (the domain of commercial minivehicles) while leveraging connected technologies and abundant data. This new collaboration is also aimed at promoting the broader use of affordable advanced safety technologies and electrification by leverag­ing Suzuki and Daihatsu’s strengths in high-­quality, low-cost manufacturing and Toyota’s CASE technologies.Leveraging Electrification and Connected Technologies to Realize JIT LogisticsAmid pressure to enhance cost competitiveness, maintaining a competitive edge in the area of commercial vehicle electrification is increasingly challenging. Competitiveness increasingly hinges on connected technologies and uses of batteries and other technologies. Accordingly, manufactur­ers must step up the unique added value that they offer.  In addition to electrification, improving transport efficiency will contribute greatly to realizing carbon neutrality. The five companies of the partnership will link their connected technology platforms to build a more comprehensive platform for commer­cial vehicles and leverage the Toyota Production System (TPS), one of Toyota’s strengths, to realize JIT logistics and increase transport efficiency, thereby helping to reduce CO2 emissions. Using connected technologies to link logistics from the major arteries to the fine capillaries, from produc­ers to consumers, using truck logistics and local minivehicle-based distribution, JIT logistics have the potential to lower running costs for logistics vendors and sustainably improve logistics.   Going forward, the five companies will deepen their collaboration while openly considering cooperation with other like-minded partners, working to help fulfill the automotive industry’s mission of helping improve people’s lives and leave a better Japan and a better planet for the next generation.  Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT29Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataWoven City: Aiming to Create a City Where People Live Happily.Building on Our History of ManufacturingWoven City will be constructed on the site of Toyota Motor East Japan’s former Higashi-Fuji Plant, which was a pillar of production for Toyota for 53 years, starting in 1967. At its peak, the plant had 2,000 employees, and a total of 7,000 individuals worked there over its history, producing such vehicles as the Toyota Century, Toyota’s flagship chauffeur car infused with Toyota crafts­manship, and the JPN Taxi, a car that requires many times the durability of an ordinary passenger car.  The concept for Woven City can be traced back to the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. President Akio Toyoda sought to create jobs for the region’s people, who were hit hardest by the disaster, by creating a third base of operations in the Tohoku region. Guided by his strong leader­ship, Toyota established Toyota Motor East Japan, Inc. in 2012. However, this also led to the difficult decision to close the Higashi-Fuji Plant. Looking for a way to carry on the Higashi-Fuji Plant’s legacy of manufacturing to help create future mobility for the next 50 years, he arrived at the idea of transforming the site into a connected city as a large-scale demonstration experiment.Our Unwavering Principles: “Human-centered,” “A Living Laboratory,” and the “Ever-evolving City”Under the Woven City project, we are imagining the life of each resident as we seek to design a city that will most make people happy. Working with researchers, engineers, and scientists, we will demonstrate future technologies in both the virtual and the real world and will roll out the resulting technologies and products developed around the globe. Woven City will be a constantly improving, ever-evolving city rooted in Toyota’s kaizen ­approach—thinking that there is always a better way. We will work with partners who share our aspiration in this quest to realize better living and mobility for all.A Test Course For Toyota as a Mobility CompanyWoven City will comprise three types of roads, woven together like warp and weft: paths for people, roads shared by people and personal mobility devices, and roads for autonomous vehicles. Aimed at realizing safe mobility, it will be a sort of test course for the integrated three-part development of automated driving at the levels of people, vehicles, and the traffic environment. In its early stages, Woven City will house around 360 residents, comprising mainly seniors, families, and inventors. In the future, the city will have more than 2,000 residents, including Toyota employees, demonstrating technologies in mobility and a wide range of other fields, from logistics to energy, food and agriculture as it grows into an environment conducive to the timely generation of new ­inventions that address social issues.  Carrying on a Commitment to “Human-centered” OperationsThe name “Woven City” comes from Toyota’s origins in automatic looms. Toyota Group founder Sakichi Toyoda was driven to invent an automatic loom out of a desire to make his mother’s work easier. We have guarded and nurtured this spirit of service to others ever since. Woven City will take up this commitment from the Higashi-Fuji Plant, growing and evolving as the foundation for a new era at Toyota.The Woven City project, first announced in January 2020, officially broke ground on February 23, 2021. Woven City will demonstrate cutting edge technologies in such areas as automated driving, mobility as a service (MaaS), personal mobility, robotics, smart homes, and artificial intelligence (AI) in a real living environment. By rapidly implementing development and demonstration cycles of technologies and services in this human-centered city, we aim to continuously produce new value and business models by utilizing the mobility of  “information,” “goods,” and “people” to support daily life.“Within Reach If You Just Keep Climbing”: Akio’s Message on Woven City Making Ever-better Cars  Initiatives to Achieve Carbon Neutrality  Software and Connected Initiatives   Commercial Sector Initiatives  Woven City\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT30Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataLeveraging Both Toyota’s Robust Business Base and Start-up Spirit to Push into the FutureEncourage and Inspire People Worldwide to “Start Your Impossibles.”Looking back over the discussions of the Board of Directors in the past year, I feel that our perspectives have broadened from surviving as an automobile manufacturer amid tremendous environmental change to include coexisting with the global environment and contributing to the lives of people in a wide range of circumstances and positions. In other words, the focus of our discussions has expanded from advancing Toyota’s interests to helping increase value for those surrounding and connected to Toyota.   Specifically, in addition to discussing the profitability and future poten­tial of projects under consideration, the Board of Directors now proac­tively spends time examining matters in terms of contribution to carbon neutrality and the Sustainable Development Goals. I think that doing so has conveyed to Toyota’s executives the importance of thinking from the perspectives of diverse stakeholders, beyond just that of Toyota itself. For my part, as an independent Outside Director, I feel that I have been able to proactively contribute to such discussions based on my experi­ence dealing directly with environmental issues and energy policy as a public servant as well as the latest information about companies in Japan and around the world.  Toyota’s business environment is expected to become even more chal­lenging and uncertain going forward. At times like these, it is crucial to not only focus on solving the issues immediately before us, but to take a long-term perspective to discuss what Toyota should do and how it must change. Only by doing so can Toyota achieve its mission of producing happiness for all—part of its founding spirit and a theme being strongly promoted by President Toyoda. I will do my utmost to help Toyota in these endeavors.We have seen President Toyoda launch Toyota’s transformation from a vehicle manufacturer to a mobility provider. This launch has faced the worst pandemic in 100 years, and I was proud to be a small part of the Toyota Group as it swung into action to produce PPE in Japan and provide rescue equipment around the world.  Being part of Toyota during these two difficult years has shown me a new, positive side to this global company.  Toyota partnered with the International Paralympic and Olympic Committees to support Paralympic and Olympic athletes all over the world, and I quickly realized how Toyota intended their amazing athletic performanc­es to encourage and inspire people worldwide to “start their impossibles.”  The fundamental principles of the Paralympic movement and the Toyota Motor Corporation are very similar: Determination, the Spirit of Challenge, Equality of Opportunity, Respect, and Inspiration.  The Olympic and Paralympic Games Tokyo 2020 showed the triumph of the human spirit and the athletes’ determination to succeed within the rules of the game. President Toyoda often says, including within Board meetings, that Toyota’s key ambition is to provide the necessary mobility products to better lives worldwide. He also has said, and this is something I particularly support, that Toyota will pay all due taxes to support society around the world.  This once-in-a-century transformation of Toyota into a mobility supplier has to incorporate carbon neutrality, which must be achieved by around 2050. No one exactly knows what will happen over the next 30 years, so it seems totally logical to me that Toyota will develop diversified power trains using different fuels and technologies. Similarly, we must not forget that there will be millions of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines well into the 2030s, 40s and even 50s, so developing less carbon-intensive fuels is crucial to achieving carbon neutrality.  I have been involved in developing leadership development programs aimed at developing vibrant teams and partnerships. This training fosters a more open style of management that encourages two-way communication and ensures the right ideas and solutions will be found for a prosperous and productive future.  Positive human energy, the most carbon neutral of all the Earth’s energy sources, is fundamental in oiling the parts of all teams and partnerships. I look forward to working with my fellow Outside Directors to help Toyota advance toward this prosperous and productive future.   I am proud to be a Toyota person!Toyota is evolving at a tremendous pace. The Company is taking dramatic leaps forward even while continuing to incrementally implement Kaizen (continuous improvement). Toyota’s focus is always turned outward, not inward, constantly asking how it can continue to provide essential value to society and, based on its conclusions, continuing to take on new challeng­es. Despite its global scale, Toyota maintains the ambitious spirit of a fledgling neighborhood workshop.   The Outside Directors take the perspectives of Toyota’s diverse stake­holders to engage in serious discussion with the internal members of the Board of Directors and executives. This often means that we challenge the ideas presented in Board of Directors Meetings. For example, we have recently been dedicating a considerable amount of time to discussing Toyota’s Woven City. I didn’t see how building a community made sense as a use of Toyota’s resources. I voiced my many doubts, and we dis­cussed the issue at length. As a result, I came to understand that Woven City will help address the environmental problems and other growing chal­lenges of urbanization around the world, that it embodies Toyota’s mission of “producing happiness for all,” and that it aligns with the aspiration Toyota has maintained since its founding of contributing to the overall good as well as the Sustainable Development Goals.  On top of all this, Woven City is also an ambitious push to refine Toyota’s strengths as a mobility company.  Toyota must learn from and tolerate failures and continually transform itself. As an Outside Director, I will provide oversight in order to maximize the value of Woven City to Toyota by enabling agile development, with cor­rections made as needed. I hope to play my part as a co-driver* so that Toyota can drive toward the future at full speed.  Under the leadership of President Toyoda, Toyota’s diverse human resources are doing their utmost to unify their focus as one team and move forward quickly, leveraging both Toyota’s robust business base and start-up spirit to push into the future.  * In rallies and other motor sports, a co-driver is a person who rides in the vehicle to assist the driver.Sir Philip CravenMessages from the Outside DirectorsHelping Increase Value for those Surrounding and Connected to ToyotaTeiko KudoIkuro Sugawara Messages from the Outside Directors  Corporate Governance  Capital Strategy  The Environment  Safety   Quality, Information Security, and Privacy  Human Rights and Supply Chains  Diversity and Inclusion   Employees, Safety and Health, and Social Contribution Activities  Risk Management and Compliance\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT31Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataAppointment/DismissalFundamental ApproachToyota regards sustainable growth and the stable, long-term enhancement of corporate value as essential management priorities. Building good relationships with all stakeholders, including share­holders, customers, business partners, local ­communities, and employees, and consistently providing products that satisfy customers’ needs are key to addressing these priorities. To this end, Toyota constantly seeks to enhance corporate governance.Corporate Governance Report  Securities Report  Business Execution and SupervisionToyota’s Corporate GovernanceContributing to society through monozukuri (manufacturing) is the basis of Toyota’s corporate value. To enhance its corporate value in the medium- to long-term, it is appropriate for Toyota to be a company with an Audit & Supervisory Board, where internal executives who have been long engaged in and have deep knowledge of manufacturing and outside executives who are capable of providing advice for the creation of new value from a broad perspective can ­participate in well-balanced decision making at the Board of Directors’ meetings.  With respect to its framework for executing operations, Toyota has been continuing its efforts to respond swiftly to the external environment, which is changing faster than ever. Following the introduction of “region-based management” in 2011, the “business unit system” in 2013, and the “in-house company system” in 2016, in 2017, Toyota further clarified that Members of the Board of Directors are responsible for decision making and management oversight and that operating officers are responsible for operational execution for the purposes of further accelerating ­implementation of decisions.  Furthermore, in 2018, Toyota brought forward the timing of executive changes from April to January, in order to further accelerate manage­ment oversight and ensure full coordination with the workplace. In addition, Toyota transformed the company structure into one that enables decision making that is both close to the needs of customers and close to where the action takes place, by taking measures such as reviewing the corporate strategy function and restructuring the Japan Sales Business Group into an organization based on regions rather than sales channels.  In 2019, to further advance its “acceleration of management” and the development of a diverse and talented workforce, Toyota made executive and organizational changes as follows: 1. Executives are composed of only senior managing officers and people of higher rank. 2. A new classification called “senior professional/senior management” (kanbushoku in Japanese) grouped and replaced the following titles or ranks: managing officers, executive general managers, (sub-executive managerial level) senior grade 1 and senior grade 2 manag­ers, and grand masters. With an eye to appointing the right people to the right positions, senior professionals/senior management hold a wide range of posts, from chief officer, deputy chief officer, plant general manager, and senior general manager to group manager, regardless of age or length of employment, in order to deal with management issues as they arise and to thereby strengthen their development as members of a diverse and talented workforce through genchi genbutsu (on-site learning and problem-solving).  In April 2020, Toyota consolidated the post of executive vice president and the post of operating officer into the post of operating officer and, in July 2020, clarified the responsibilities of operating officers. We redefined the role of operating officer to be members who, together with the president, have cross-functional oversight of the entire company. Furthermore, in-house company presidents, regional CEOs and chief officers, as on-site leaders of business implementation elements, were given authority while being ­consolidated into the rank of senior professionals/senior management. The roles of operating officers and senior professionals/senior manage­ment are to be determined where and as needed, and persons appointed as operating officers and senior professionals/senior management are to change in accordance with the challenges faced and the path that should be taken, as the ­company exercises greater flexibility than ever in appointing the right people to the right positions. Toyota, based on its basic policy of appointing the right people to the right positions, has been swiftly and continuously innovating. We will further press forward with the tide of such innovations, aiming for a corporate structure capable of carrying out management from a viewpoint that is optimal for a global company.Changes in

of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataMembers of Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory BoardBoard of Directors and Related StructuresWith respect to the system regarding Members of the Board of Directors, Toyota has comprehen­sively considered and appointed the right person for the right position to make appropriate and prompt decision making. Toyota believes that it is critical to appoint individuals who contribute to decision making aimed at sustainable growth into the future according to the concept of the “Toyoda Precepts,” which set forth our founding philosophy. Moreover, these individuals should be able to play a significant role in transforming Toyota into a “mobility company” by responding to social change using CASE*1 technologies and building external partnerships, contributing to provide solutions for social issues including the SDGs. The Board of Directors should consist of members who have the ­abundant knowledge, deep insight and the highly professional expertise needed by Toyota, and members are appointed with consideration for diversity. For each Director candidate, members of the Executive Appointment Meeting, of which the majority are Outside Directors, make ­recommendations to the Board of Directors.  Furthermore, 3 Outside Members of the Board of Directors have been appointed in order to adequately reflect the opinions of those from outside the Company in management’s ­decision-making process, and all of them are registered as independent officers with the ­relevant financial instruments exchanges.  Toyota considers the appointment of Outside Members of the Board of Directors as independent officers in accordance with the requirements for Outside Members of the Board of Directors set out in the Companies Act and independence standards established by the relevant financial instruments exchanges.  Outside Members of the Board of Directors provide advice in Toyota’s management ­decision-making process based on their broad experience and insight, independently from the management structure. To allow the insight of Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board to be fully made use of, Toyota has launched the following measures:1  \u0007Review the criteria for the submission of proposals to the Board of Directors as needed to reduce the number of proposals submitted, so that sufficient time can be secured to discuss each proposal.2  \u0007Provide an explanation of all proposals in advance to help understand the background of the proposals.3  \u0007Remove the time limit for discussions at Board of Directors’ meetings to ensure sufficient discussion can be held.4  \u0007Besides the Board of Directors meetings, set periodic opportunities for two-way communica­tion between Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board and the operational execution side on important management issues and medium-to long-term issues.  In recent years, to facilitate active discussion at Board of Directors’ meetings, Toyota has reduced the number of members (Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members) of the Board of Directors’ Meeting (from 34 in 2010 to 15 in 2020). As a result, opportunities for each member to speak at Board of Directors’ meetings have increased, enabling Outside Members of the Board of Directors and the Audit & Supervisory Board to speak on almost all proposals.*1 CASE: Connected, Autonomous/Automated, Shared, ElectricAudit & Supervisory Board SystemToyota has adopted an Audit & Supervisory Board system. 6 Audit & Supervisory Board Members (including 3 Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members) play a key role in Toyota’s corporate governance by undertaking audits in line with the audit policies and plans. In appointing Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota believes it is necessary to elect individuals who have broad experience and insight in their respective fields of expertise and can advise management from a fair and neutral perspective, as well as audit the execution of business. Toyota’s Executive Appointment Meeting discusses ­recommendations to the Audit & Supervisory Board regarding appointment or dismissal of Audit & Supervisory Board Members.  Toyota has appointed 3 Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, all of whom are registered as independent officers with the relevant financial instrument exchanges. When appointing Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members, Toyota considers the requirements set out in the Companies Act as well as the independence standards ­established by the relevant financial instrument exchanges. In recent years, the Audit & Supervisory Board and the internal audit function have been strengthening their ties by increasing the ­opportunities to share their audit results, with the aim of improving the effectiveness of their audits.Analysis and Evaluation of the Effectiveness of the Board of Directors In order to improve the effectiveness of the Board of Directors, Toyota has been conducting an analysis and evaluation of the Board of Directors every year. The most recent evaluation is ­performed as below.1. Analysis and evaluationAfter a survey about the composition, operation and efficacy of the supervisory function of the Board of Directors was conducted, interviews were held with the Outside Members of the Board of Directors, the Audit & Supervisory Board Members, and certain management Members of the Board of Directors based on results of the survey. Once views and proposals regarding the background and causes of the identified issues, as well as the improvement trajectory for such issues, were compiled and reported to the Board of Directors, they were discussed at the Board of Directors’ Meeting.• \u0007Method of evaluation: Self-evaluation through surveys and interviews• \u0007Subject of evaluation: Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members• \u0007Implementation period: February 2021 to April 2021• Matters to be evaluated: Matters including 1  \u0007composition and operation of the Board of Directors 2  \u0007management and business strategy 3  \u0007corporate ethics and risk management 4  \u0007communication with stakeholders such as shareholders2. Summary of the findingsAs a result of the evaluation, it was confirmed that the operation of and the quality and content of the discussions at the Board of Directors were ­improving year by year, and that effectiveness was therefore ensured, through measures such as providing sufficient explanations of the presented agenda items in advance and having periodic exchanges of views with external officers on matters such as medium- to long-term ­management challenges.  Toyota identified issues to be resolved in order to further enhance effectiveness, such as increasing opportunities to discuss important matters related to management strategies and enhancing the provision of information in order to decide on investments such as those in new businesses. The Board of Directors will make improvements on these issues.Training for Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board MembersIn order to ensure that Outside Members of the Board of Directors and Outside Audit & Supervisory Board Members understand Toyota’s philosophy and efforts, Toyota arranges on-site inspections, including at its subsidiaries, and other opportunities. Also, as explained above, besides the Board of Directors Meetings we offer opportu­nities to help deepen their understanding, such as advance explanations on proposals submitted to the meetings and two-way communication with the operational executive on important management issues and medium- to long-term issues.Executive CompensationThe amount of executive compensation, how its calculation method is determined, and the ­calculation method are described below.Decision Policy and ProcessToyota believes that it is critical to appoint individuals who contribute to decision making aimed at sustain­able growth into the future according to the concept of the “Toyoda Precepts,” which set forth our found­ing philosophy. Moreover, these individuals should be able to play a significant role in ­transforming Toyota into a “mobility company” by responding to social changes using CASE and external partnerships, while working towards providing solutions for social issues such as the ones represented in SDGs.

Remuneration is effectively linked to corporate performance while reflecting individual job responsi­bilities and performance. Remuneration standards in each member’s home country are also taken into account when determining remuneration amounts and methods. Remuneration for Outside Members of the Board of Directors and Audit & Supervisory Board Members consists only of fixed payments. As a result, this remuneration is not readily impacted by business performance, helping to ensure indepen­dence from management.  The amounts of remuneration and other payments to each member of the Board of Directors and the remuneration system are decided by the Board of Directors and the “Executive Compensation Meeting,” a majority of the ­members of which are Outside Members of the Board of Directors, to ensure the independence of the decisions.  The Board of Directors resolves the policy for determining remuneration for and other payments to each member of the Board of Directors and the executive remuneration system as well as the total amount of remuneration for a given fiscal year. The Board of Directors also resolves to delegate the determination of the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors to the Executive Compensation Meeting. The Executive Compensation Meeting reviews the executive remuneration system on which it will consult with the Board of Directors and determines the amount of remuneration for each Member of the Board of Directors, taking into account factors such as corporate performance as well as individual job responsibilities and performance, in accordance with the policy for determining remuneration for and other payments to each member of the Board of Directors established by the Board of Directors. The Board of Directors considers that such decisions made by the Executive Compensation Meeting are in line with the policy on determining remuneration and other payments for each member of the Board of Directors.  Remuneration for Audit & Supervisory Board Members is determined by the Audit & Supervisory Board within the scope determined by resolution of the shareholders’ meeting. To decide the compensation for the fiscal year under review, the Executive Compensation Meeting was held in May 2020, March 2021, and April 2021. Also, preparatory meetings attended solely by Outside Directors were held five times in August, September, and October 2020 and February and March 2021 to hold discussions in preparation for the Executive Compensation Meeting. The ­compensation for the Members of the Board of Directors was decided with the agreement of all members of the Executive Compensation Meeting.Major Matters Discussed at the Executive Compensation Meeting• \u0007Compensation levels according to position and responsibilities• \u0007Benchmarks and actual results evaluation for FY2021• Individual performance evaluation• The remuneration for each individualMethod of Determining Performance-based Remuneration (bonuses, share-based compensation)1.\u0007 Directors with Japanese citizenship (excluding Outside Directors)Toyota sets the total amount of remuneration (Annual Total Remuneration) received by each director in a year based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of the share price of Toyota and individual performance evaluation. The balance after deducting monthly remuneration, which is fixed remuneration, from Annual Total Remuneration constitutes performance-linked remuneration.  Toyota sets an appropriate executive compen­sation level for the Annual Total Remuneration based on position and duties by referencing a benchmark group of companies located in Japan.Table 1Table 2Method of Setting the Annual Total RemunerationAnnual Total Remuneration is set according to a formula based on the benchmark results of executive compensation. Annual Total Remuneration for each position is set based on consolidated operating income and the volatility of the share price of Toyota, and then adjusted based on individual performance evaluation. Individual performance evaluation is conducted in view of the efforts made according to the concept of the “Toyoda Precepts,” which set forth our founding philosophy, and other aspects such as the trust of others and promotion of employee development, based on which the amount of Annual Total Remuneration for each director is determined within the range of 25% above or below the Annual Total Remuneration for each position.2. \u0007Directors with foreign citizenship (excluding Outside Directors)Fixed remuneration and performance-based remu­neration are set based on remuneration levels and structures that allow Toyota to secure and retain talented personnel. Fixed remuneration is set, taking into account each member’s job responsibilities and the remuneration standard of his/her home country. Performance-based remuneration is set based on consolidated operating income, the volatility of the share price of Toyota, and individual performance, taking into account each member’s job responsibili­ties and the remuneration standard of his/her home country. The concept of each item is the same as for directors with Japanese citizenship (excluding Outside Directors). Differences in tax rates in Japan and their home countries may be considered and compensated for.Share-based Compensation SystemThe Board of Directors decides the share-based compensation, using the maximum share-based compensation (4.0 billion yen per year) set in the 115th Ordinary General Shareholders’ Meeting held on June 13, 2019.

Messages from the Outside Directors  Corporate Governance  Capital Strategy  The Environment  Safety   Quality, Information Security, and Privacy  Human Rights and Supply Chains  Diversity and Inclusion   Employees, Safety and Health, and Social Contribution Activities  Risk Management and ComplianceThree PillarsThe three pillars of Toyota’s financial strategy are stability, growth, and efficiency. By maintaining adequate stability while pursuing growth and efficiency over the medium and long terms, we aim to build a robust financial foundation to support sustainable growth.1. Stability: Securing LiquidityHaving experienced financial crises and the Great East Japan Earthquake, in order to ensure busi­ness continuity in any business environment, we maintain a sufficient level of liquidity to cover half a year of both fixed costs in the automotive busi­ness and refinancing requirements in the financial services business.  Ample liquidity is essential to maintaining a full line-up in each region and retaining the ability to respond to all options and opportunities in this era of profound transformation in mobility. As such, it is a vital part of the foundation supporting the creation of corporate value.2. \u0007Growth: Aggressive Forward-looking InvestmentAs the auto industry approaches a once-in-a-­century turning point, Toyota is focusing on technological innovation aimed at transforming into a mobility company. Every year, we spend more than 1 trillion yen on R&D. By enhancing efficiency in existing areas, we are strategically increasing the portion of R&D spending allotted to cutting-edge fields.3. Efficiency: Enhancing Capital EfficiencyUsing cost reduction and the thorough application of the Toyota Production System (TPS), we are reinforcing the profit structure and securing funds to invest in advanced and cutting-edge technologies.  In capital expenditure other than R&D expenses, as well, we are carefully assigning priority to individual projects and tracking their progress while advancing measures to improve productivity, such as streamlining development in existing fields, making equipment more compact, shortening processes, and facilitating faster response to changes in production quantities.  Furthermore, in addition to sustainably increasing ROE by repurchasing shares, we are strengthening investment management by regularly evaluating the rationality of our strategic shareholdings in terms of the needs of our business strategies and economic utility. In these ways, we are striving to enhance capital efficiency.Dividend PolicyToyota deems the benefit of its shareholders an important element of its management policy and continues to work to improve its corporate struc­ture and enhance its corporate value in order to realize sustainable growth. Toyota strives to ensure the stable and continuous payment of dividends, seeking to maintain and improve upon the consolidated payout ratio of 30%. To win out over tough competition, Toyota will utilize retained earnings mainly for investment in next-generation growth, such as environmental technologies aimed at realizing a carbon-neutral society and safety technologies for the safety and peace of mind of customers.  Toyota’s basic policy for paying dividends from surplus is to pay dividends twice a year, as an interim dividend and year-end dividend. Based on Toyota’s Articles of Incorporation, these dividends are decided by resolution of the Board of Directors. In accordance with this policy, for the year ended March 2021, Toyota paid an interim dividend of 105 yen per share and a year-end dividend of 135 per share, for an annual dividend of 240 yen per share. For the year ending March 2022, Toyota has decided to pay an interim dividend of 120 yen per share. Strategic Shareholdings1. Policies on Strategic ShareholdingsToyota’s policy is to not maintain strategic share­holdings except for in cases where such holdings are deemed to be meaningful. Cases where such holdings are deemed to be meaningful are defined as cases where it is determined that, in the busi­ness of manufacturing of automobiles, in which it is essential to maintain a variety of cooperative relationships throughout the entire process of development, procurement, production, distribu­tion, and sales, such holdings contribute to the improvement of corporate value from a medium- to long-term perspective based on a comprehensive consideration of business strategy, the establish­ment, maintenance, and strengthening of relation­ships with business partners, and contribution to and cooperation in the development of society.2. \u0007Assessment of the Propriety of Strategic Shareholdings When necessary, Toyota engages in constructive dialogue with the issuers of shares that it holds to encourage them to improve corporate value and achieve sustainable growth. These dialogues provide opportunities to share and address business challenges. Every year, at the Board of Directors, Toyota reviews whether its individual shareholdings are meaningful in light of changes in the business environment, specifically examines whether the benefits and risks from such holdings are commensurate with the cost of capital, etc., and assesses the propriety of Toyota’s strategic shareholdings.  If Toyota determines that a shareholding is no longer meaningful or the meaning of a sharehold­ing has been diluted due to changes in the business environment or other reasons, Toyota will proceed with the sale of such shares once it has adequately explained its reasons for doing so to the issuer.  Consequently, the number of companies whose shares Toyota strategically holds has been re­duced to 157 (including 54 listed companies) as of March 31, 2021 from 200 (including 80 listed companies) as of March 31, 2015.Woven Planet BondsIn the year ended March 2021, Toyota issued Woven Planet Bonds to raise funds for projects that contribute to the achievement of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

Strategies and policies in each area in light of risks and opportunities are set mainly by the Environmental Product Design Assessment Committee, the Production Environment Committee and the Resource Recycling Committee and all relevant organizations work together to carry out initiatives.  Environmental secretariats have been estab­lished in six regions (North America, Europe, China, Asia, South America and South Africa) in order to undertake globally integrated environ­mental initiatives while taking local conditions into consideration. The secretariats share a commit­ment to the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and promote cooperation.   Moreover, the Sustainability Meeting, which is chaired by the Chief Sustainability Officer (CSO), deliberates in a timely fashion the long-term enhancement of competitiveness and responses to risks considering internal and external changes on issues such as environment, social and ­governance, and reports the results to the Board of Directors.  Progress regarding measures to reduce CO2 in the areas of product development and production are regularly reported as key management ­indicators at meetings attended by all of those at the chief officer or company president level and above.StrategyToyota Environmental Challenge 2050Toyota formulated the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 in October 2015 and the 2030 Milestone in 2018, ensuring that it would continue to tackle challenges from a long-term perspective that looks to the world 20 and 30 years ahead and addresses such global environmental issues as climate change, water shortages, resource depletion, and loss of biodiversity.Risks and Opportunities Relating to Climate ChangeToyota strives to identify the various risks and opportunities that will arise from environmental issues and takes action accordingly while continu­ously confirming the validity of strategies such as the Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050 and working to enhance its competitiveness.  Among these risks and opportunities, climate change requires measures in various areas, including the adoption of new technology and response to tighter government regulations. As climate change progresses, higher temperatures, rising sea levels, and an increase in the severity of natural disasters such as typhoons and flooding are expected.   These changes may have various impacts on Toyota’s business fields and may also pose risks to Toyota’s business. However, it is our under­standing that if we can respond appropriately, this will lead to enhanced competitiveness and the acquisition of new business opportunities.  In accordance with this understanding, we have organized the risks relating to climate change and identified particularly significant risks in line with risk management processes based on the degree of impact and stakeholders’ interest.Scenario Analysis Assuming Risks and OpportunitiesClimate change and the policies of various ­countries may expose the automobile industry and the entire mobility society to substantial changes. These changes will present both risks and opportunities to Toyota. We used scenarios such as those of the IEA* to examine future images of society based on the current policy scenario, below 2°C scenario, and 1.5°C scenario at around 2030 for Toyota’s external environment, in light of risk and opportunity analysis.  In a society based on the below 2°C scenario or 1.5°C scenario in which climate change measures proceed, the percentage of electrified vehicles (ZEVs in particular) will increase. In case of a society based on the 1.5°C scenario in particular, it is said that the percentage of ZEVs among new vehicle sales will increase greatly and the use of CO2-free fuels such as biofuels will also expand, mainly for large cargo and marine/air transport.* \u0007Set using scenarios such as the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario (STEPS), Sustainable Development Scenario (SDS), and Net Zero Emissions by 2050 Scenario (NZE) as referenceSignificant Risks and Opportunities and Toyota’s MeasuresRisksOpportunitiesToyota’s MeasuresRelationship with Climate ScenarioCurrent ScenarioEnhanced Measures Scenario (below 2°C/1.5°C)Tightening of regulations forfuel efficiency and ZEVs (acceleration of electrification)• \u0007Fines for failure in achieving fuel efficiency regulations• \u0007Decrease in total vehicle sales due to delays in complying with ZEV regulations• \u0007Stranded assets related to internal combustion engine manufacturing facilities• \u0007Increase in sales of electrified vehicles•\u0007Increase in profits from external sales of electrification systems• \u0007Maintenance of the top-level fuel efficiency (currently the highest in Europe)• \u0007Increase in investment in batteries and shift of resources• \u0007Start of external sales of electrification systems• Expansion of electrified vehicle lineup• \u0007Reduction of CO2 emissions from vehicles currently in useImpacts will be an extension of current statusImpacts will increaseExpansion of carbon pricing• \u0007Increase in production and purchasing costs due to the introduction of carbon taxes, etc.\t• \u0007Decrease in energy costs due to promoting the introduction of energy-saving technology• \u0007Reduction of energy use through comprehen­sive energy conservation and promotion of renewable energy and hydrogen use• \u0007Promotion of emission reductions in collaboration with suppliers\tImpacts will be an extension of current statusImpacts will increaseIncrease in frequency and severity of natural disasters• \u0007Production suspension due to damage to production sites and supply chain disruptions caused by natural disasters• \u0007Increase in demand for electrified vehicles due to increased need for supply of power from automobiles during emergency situations• \u0007Implementation of continuous adaptive improvements to our BCP in light of disaster experiences• \u0007Reinforcement of information gathering in collaboration with suppliers to avoid purchasing delaysImpacts will increaseImpacts will be an extension of current statusAdvances in battery technologyFuture Image of Current Policy ScenarioFuture Image of Below 2°C ScenarioIncrease in frequency and severity of natural disasters such as floodingIncrease in percentage of electrified vehiclesFuture Image of 1.5°C ScenarioPurchasing & productionLarge-scale introduction of renewable energyRelatively moderate increase in ­frequency and severity of disasters (compared to other scenarios)Changes in consumer preferencesReputationOnerous requests for wider and deeper information disclosureGlobal new vehicle sales marketMajor increase in percentage of ZEVsExpansion of CO2-free fuel useTightening of policies and vehicle regulations in various countries Introduction of energy-saving technology and expanded use of renewable energy and hydrogenTightening of ESG assessment criteria and calls for disclosureExpansion of carbon taxes and carbon pricingIncrease in physical risks such as disastersPopularization of renewable energy Messages from the Outside Directors  Corporate Governance  Capital Strategy  The Environment  Safety   Quality, Information Security, and Privacy  Human Rights and Supply Chains  Diversity and Inclusion   Employees, Safety and Health, and Social Contribution Activities  Risk Management and Compliance\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT36Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate Data  In April 2021, Toyota proclaimed that it would address global-scale challenges to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050.  To achieve carbon neutrality, Toyota will continue implementing electrified vehicle strategies that contribute to reducing CO2 emissions throughout the product life cycle while coordinating with national governments regarding energy policies, including renewable energy and charging ­infrastructure, and public policies, including purchasing grants, supplier support, and battery recycling systems.  Toyota has sold a cumulative total of over 18 million electrified vehicles worldwide. As one of the first companies to respond to climate change risks, it has achieved a CO2 emissions reduction of over 140 million tons.  Going forward, with regard to battery electric vehicles (BEVs), we will successively introduce models with dedicated platforms starting in 2022 and seek to achieve practical vehicle supply through battery development and production strategies.  In consideration of diverse customer needs and region-specific electric power conditions, we are promoting electrification from all directions, including hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs), plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs), and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) in addition to BEVs.  In December 2021, we announced our aim of developing 30 types of BEVs and achieving a full lineup in the passenger and commercial segments globally by 2030 to reach 3.5 million annual global vehicle sales by 2030.  We will continue to respond to market changes with flexibility and use the strengths we have gained through experience to date to expand electrified vehicle options. In this way, we will be the choice of customers in each region and continue ­accelerating the realization of carbon neutrality.  In addition to increasing the number of electrified vehicles, it is important to expand technology options to reduce the CO2 emissions of vehicles currently in use as well. This may include the adoption of CO2 emissions-reducing off-cycle technology*1 (items not necessarily reflected in driving mode fuel efficiency) and the development of engines that can use CO2-free fuel, such as hydrogen engines.  In the production field, we announced that we aim to achieve carbon neutrality at our global plants by 2035. We are promoting the reduction of CO2 emissions through comprehensive energy ­conservation and the introduction of renewable energy and hydrogen at plants. We have already achieved a 100 percent renewable electricity introduction rate at all plants in Europe and South America.  To confirm the validity and progress of Toyota’s strategies, we will conduct appropriate information disclosures regarding various ESG assessment indicators and enhance dialogue with stakeholders, including institutional investors. We believe that this will enable stable fund procurement and lasting corporate value enhancement.*1 \u0007Technologies such as high efficiency lighting, waste heat recovery, active aerodynamic improvement, and solar radiation/temperature management that improve actual fuel consumption. Risk ManagementRisk Management through the Toyota Global Risk Management Standard (TGRS)Under supervision of the Chief Risk Officer (CRO), we promote management focused on proactive preventive measures by gathering and analyzing all risks related to Toyota’s corporate activities and behavior, including in the area of the environment, and developing a system (TGRS) under which we take countermeasures.Risk Management Relating to Climate ChangeWe strive to understand the various risks and opportunities arising due to climate change and always check the validity of our strategies using scenario analysis to minimize risks and enhance  our competitiveness.Metrics and TargetsThe 2030 Milestone envisions our future as of 2030 toward achieving Toyota Environmental Challenge 2050.

While the number of deaths due to traffic accidents has been gradually ­decreasing in Japan, the United States, and Europe, it has been increasing elsewhere, especially in emerging nations, as improvements in safety education and transportation infrastructure have not kept up with increases in cars on the road. Unless countermeasures are implemented, traffic accident causalities are predicted to become the seventh leading cause of death globally by 2030.  For Toyota to achieve its ultimate goal of elimi­nating traffic accident causalities, the development of safe vehicles is of course important, but it is also essential to educate people, including drivers and pedestrians, and to ensure safe traffic infra­structure, including traffic signals and roads.  To achieve a safe mobility society, Toyota believes it will be important to implement an integrated three-part initiative involving people, vehicles, and the traffic environment, as well as to pursue real-world safety by learning from actual accidents and incorporating that knowledge into vehicle development.   Toyota has defined its Integrated Safety Management Concept as the basic philosophy behind its technologies for eliminating traffic casualties and is moving forward with development.* Source: Global Status Report on Road Safety 2018, WHOIntegrated Safety Management ConceptToyota provides optimized driver support at every stage of driving, from parking to normal operation, the moment before a collision, during a collision, and post-collision emergency response. We also aim to enhance safety by strengthening inter-system coordination, rather than considering each system separately. These are the approaches behind our Integrated Safety Management Concept.Active SafetyThe Toyota Safety Sense system packages multiple active safety functions based around three major functions considered effective in reducing serious traffic accidents causing death or injury. These are Pre-Collision Safety (PCS), which helps avoid and mitigate damage from collisions with cars ahead or pedestrians; Lane Departure Alert (LDA), which contributes to preventing accidents caused by leaving the lane of travel; and Automatic High Beam (AHB), which helps ensure clear sight in front of the vehicle at night. In 2018, we expanded the system’s driving assistance functions, such as nighttime pedestrian and daytime cyclist detection and Lane Tracing Assist (LTA).  Since its market launch in 2015, Toyota Safety Sense has been installed in more than 27 million vehicles globally (as of October 2021). Toyota Safety Sense is now available on nearly all passen­ger car models (as standard or option) in the Japanese, U.S., and European markets. It has also been introduced in a total of 120 countries and regions, including such key markets as China, other select Asian countries, the Middle East, and Australia.Passive SafetyPassive safety combines a body structure that absorbs collision energy with that support to protect the vehicle occupants to minimize collision damage. In 1995, in the pursuit of world-leading safety, Toyota created its own stringent internal target related to passive safety performance called “Global Outstanding Assessment (GOA)” and developed a collision-safety body structure and passenger protection devices. Since then, to maintain its leadership in this field, Toyota has continued to evolve GOA, striving to improve the real-world safety performance of its vehicles in a wide variety of accidents.  To analyze vehicle-related injuries, Toyota collaborated with Toyota Central R&D Labs., Inc. to develop the Total Human Model for Safety (THUMS), a virtual human body model. THUMS is being used in the research and development of a variety of safety technologies, including seat belts, airbags, and other safety equipment, as well as vehicle structures that mitigate injuries in accidents involving pedestrians. Toyota made THUMS freely available through its website in January 2021 in the hope that it will be used by more people across more applications. Emergency ResponseEvery minute counts in the response to an accident or medical emergency. In 2000, Toyota rolled out its HELPNET® service, an emergency reporting system utilizing the G-Book information network (now T-Connect) and G-Link in Japan. In the event of an accident or medical emergency, HELPNET® contacts a dedicated operator who will arrange for the rapid dispatch of an emergency vehicle from the police or fire department/emergency services. HELPNET® automatically contacts an operator when the airbags deploy and supports D-Call Net®, a service available throughout Japan that makes quick deployment decisions for air ambulances. This service is provided by sending vehicle data to the HELPNET center from an on-board data communication module (DCM). DCM is installed as a standard feature in all new passenger vehicles in Japan.Initiatives for PeopleToyota believes that education is an important part of preventing traffic accidents.  To prevent accidents involving small children, in cooperation with Toyota dealers across Japan, Toyota has been donating traffic safety teaching materials to kindergartens and nursery schools nationwide since 1969. In 2020, we revamped our educational website for children and guardians, and we use our website and social media to raise awareness of traffic safety while walking and cycling.   For drivers, we periodically hold the Toyota Driver Communication safe driving technique seminar at Toyota Safety Education Center Mobilitas, on the grounds of Fuji Speedway.  Additionally, in step with the government-promoted Safety Support Car program, we are working with Toyota dealers across Japan to roll out safety and assurance activities under the name “Support Toyota” to help realize car ownership experiences that offer safety and assurance.Automatically sends alert when airbags are deployedSends position and other vehicle dataor Messages from the Outside Directors  Corporate Governance  Capital Strategy  The Environment  Safety   Quality, Information Security, and Privacy  Human Rights and Supply Chains  Diversity and Inclusion   Employees, Safety and Health, and Social Contribution Activities  Risk Management and Compliance\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT38Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataQuality, Information Security and PrivacyQualityInformation Security and PrivacyLogistics• \u0007Establishment and instruction of transportation standards• \u0007Quality deterioration prevention, etc.Audit and improvementQuality AssuranceQuality Assurance CycleInspection• \u0007Inspection planning and implementation• \u0007Checking and maintenance of inspection tools, equipment, etc.Production• Manufacturing quality assurance• \u0007Process maintenance and control, etc.Production preparations• Process and equipment planning• Process capability allocation• \u0007Inspection method establishment and measurement of initial products, etc.Purchasing• Verification of supplier capability• \u0007Conclusion of business contracts, etc.Sales and after-sales service• \u0007Collection of quality information in the market• Dealer education and instruction• Service parts warranty, etc.Development• Product basic plan formulation• Design quality assurance• Prototype evaluation, etc.Product planning• Product plan formulation• Development target setting• Quality target setting, etc.Fundamental ApproachThe origins of Toyota’s “Customer First” and “Quality First” principles lie in the Five Main Principles of Toyoda, which embody the thinking of Sakichi Toyoda, and the spirit of audit and improvement espoused by Kiichiro Toyoda. Since its foundation, Toyota has built a corporate culture that focuses particular attention on quality that will produce customer smiles and on Kaizen (continu­ous improvement) achieved through Genchi Genbutsu (onsite, hands-on experience). Each employee in every area maintains a constant and strong awareness of issues and a sense of ownership and makes ongoing efforts to imple­ment Kaizen and collaborate closely with person­nel in other fields in order to enhance customer safety, peace of mind, and satisfaction.  Toyota sees quality as the combination of product quality, sales and service quality, and, as the foundation supporting these, the quality of the work performed by each employee.  We believe that products and services that gain the confidence of customers can be created only when all employees across every process—from development, purchasing, production, and sales to after-sales service—build quality into their work, coordinate with one another across processes, and implement the quality assurance cycle. Fostering Awareness and Corporate CultureTo foster a corporate culture in which each member is committed to building in high quality, Toyota works to develop human resources and improve work quality by holding quality awareness promotion events for all employees every year and by providing qualification-specific education in quality assurance. Furthermore, February 24, the anniversary of the day that President Akio Toyoda attended the U.S. Congressional hearings held to investigate the series of recall issues that occurred in 2010, has been designated “Toyota Restart Day.” We have created mechanisms and are taking measures to raise awareness in order to keep the lessons learned from the series of recall issues fresh.  In 2014, Toyota established its Customer Quality Learning Center as a crucial education facility for conveying the experiences and lessons learned from the series of recall issues to future generations of employees. Using exhibits that engage the five senses, such as actual examples of faulty parts and vehicle simulators, the Center serves the important role of conveying the situa­tion back then to current Toyota employees.  In addition to information about the series of recall issues, recent quality issues are added to update the program every year. In this way, we strive to ensure that the facility effectively main­tains focus on lessons we have learned. We have also set up customer quality learning centers unique to individual plants and global sites as part of efforts to ensure employees in each region and at each plant thoroughly understand the ­importance of quality.Fundamental Approach Cyber attacks are growing more sophisticated and complex. Their corporate targets have expanded from confidential information and information systems to include the networks of systems that control plants and vehicles, such as those for on-board devices. Information security is thus an increasingly important priority for Toyota.  Toyota considers ensuring the safety and peace of mind of its customers as well as protecting its customers’ personal information and other assets to be its social responsibility. Information Security InitiativesToyota has established the All Toyota Security Guidelines (ATSG) covering subsidiaries and affiliates, as an information security framework for comprehensively preventing information leaks and responding to cyber attacks.  ATSG ensures information security through a multi-faceted approach encompassing organiza­tional management, human resource manage­ment, technical security, physical security, and incident/accident response. To adapt to recent environmental changes, ATSG is revised periodically.  By annually inspecting the information security initiatives being implemented at each company in line with ATSG, Toyota works to ensure the continuous maintenance and improvement of their information security. Since fiscal 2019, a special­ized team has been continuously carrying out on-site audits of all of our consolidated subsidiar­ies to check responses to ATSG and the status of implementation of physical security measures at each company.  Furthermore, in terms of automobile-related initiatives, Toyota is a member of the Automotive Information Sharing & Analysis Center (Auto-ISAC) in Japan and the United States, a framework for sharing knowledge related to information security, and actively utilizes it to learn promptly about cases that occur within the industry and put them to use in our development.Initiatives to Ensure Respect for PrivacyIn line with changes in the business environment, including business model transitions for the CASE era and recent increases in consumer awareness, the importance to Toyota of protecting personal information and ensuring respect for privacy is greater than ever. Accordingly, Toyota established the Privacy Code of Conduct in 2021. These guidelines lay out Toyota’s ideals for handling personal information and privacy-related informa­tion, indicating the way forward for the Company and employees as part of efforts to ensure that we can provide products and services that are sympathetic towards society and individuals.

Seeking the happiness of others than ourselves is a part of Toyota’s founding principles and was a driving force that led to the invention of the automatic loom, which can be considered the beginning of Toyota. This spirit and pursuit is still within us today. Under the mission of “Producing Happiness for All,” within every country and every region in which we operate, we aim to be the best company in town, one that is both loved and trusted by the people. The automobile industry depends on the support of numerous people, including local communities, business partners (such as suppliers and dealers), and customers. We will continue to protect the human rights of our employees, customers, and all people involved in our business activities and to improve such protections in order to benefit society.Human Rights Policy Human Rights Due Diligence*To address human rights-related issues throughout the supply chain, Toyota applies the Toyota Supplier Sustainability Guidelines, which specifi­cally state its expectation that its suppliers respect human rights. Working together with suppliers on risk monitoring, countermeasure development, tracking, and remediation, Toyota provides guidance and support to potentially affected stakeholders.  Furthermore, we work with NGOs and other external stakeholders to both understand societal expectations and assess our prioritized activities from a third-party perspective. By doing so, we hope to increase transparency and ensure that corporate activities are fair and appropriate.Toyota’s Action Taken for Forced Labor of Migrant Workers (Statement on the Modern Slavery Acts)To comply with the United Kingdom’s Modern Slavery Act 2015 and other similar legislation (such as Australia’s Modern Slavery Act 2018), Toyota issued the statement “Toyota’s action taken for Forced Labor of Migrant Workers (Statement on the Modern Slavery Acts),” covering its domestic and overseas production facilities.  In this statement, we disclose Toyota’s commit­ment to the relevant laws and describe measures we have implemented to prevent any instance of modern slavery, including human trafficking, in either our direct operations or supply chain.Toyota’s action taken for Forced Labor of Migrant Workers (Statement on Modern Slavery Acts) * \u0007The process of identifying, preventing, and mitigating negative human rights impactsMeasures to Protect the Human Rights of Foreign Workers: Participation in the Japan Platform for Migrant Workers towards Responsible and Inclusive SocietyToyota participates in the Japan Platform for Migrant Workers towards Responsible and Inclusive Society established by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA). This platform is aimed at the protection of the human rights of foreign workers and the improvement of their working and living environments.  In accordance with the platform’s code of conduct, Toyota recognizes that it has an obliga­tion to protect the human rights of foreign workers and to support the development of appropriate working and living conditions throughout the supply chain. We expect that collaboration with our platform partners will have a positive impact on the overall supply chain.  Toyota will continue its efforts toward the realization of decent work in its direct and indirect operations.Japan Platform for Migrant Workers towards Responsible and Inclusive Society Fundamental ApproachSince its establishment, Toyota has worked closely with its suppliers in its manufacturing operations. As part of these efforts, Toyota has globally implemented its Basic Purchasing Policies in accordance with the spirit of mutual benefit based on mutual trust. We strive to maintain close relationships with existing and new suppliers as we work together to promote our Customer First policy.  In 2009, we established the Supplier CSR Guidelines, laying out the role of businesses in society to facilitate efforts undertaken with our suppliers. In 2012, Toyota revised the guidelines to more clearly indicate its approaches to strengthening human rights monitoring and corrective actions taken in the supply chain and to conflict minerals.   In 2021, we made further revisions focused mainly on addressing environmental and human rights issues that have grown more serious in recent years.   When conducting business transactions, we conclude contracts that clearly spell out legal compliance, respect for human rights, and con­siderations for local and global environments.  Internally, we work to raise the awareness of all our employees, including buyers, through ­seminars and training.Toyota Supplier Guidelines Conflict Minerals Report Initiatives for Compliance and ImplementationTo ensure their understanding and implementation of the guidelines, all Toyota suppliers are request­ed to periodically check the status of their imple­mentation using a self-inspection sheet.  In October 2020, around 350 Tier-1 suppliers, which account for over 90% of our purchase volume in Japan, submitted the results of their self-inspections, indicating their status of ­implementation. At the same time, if we receive a report of a problem from an outside source, we investigate and, if needed, ask the supplier in question to correct it. We subsequently keep lines of communication with the supplier open to ensure the correction is made, thereby preventing recurrences and escalations.Responsible Sourcing of CobaltCobalt, used in batteries and other products necessary for automobile electrification, is an important mineral resource for Toyota. Toyota recognizes that there are concerns associated with the mining of cobalt regarding child labor and other human rights violations and abuses.  Toyota has formulated its Policies and Approaches to Responsible Mineral Sourcing based on the OECD Due Diligence Guidance for Responsible Supply Chains of Minerals from Conflict-affected and High-risk Areas, and pro­motes responsible mineral procurement by such means as conducting surveys aimed at enhancing the transparency of its supply chain.  Meanwhile, by participating in the activities of the RMI Cobalt Working Group, Toyota Motor North America (U.S.) is encouraging smelters and refiners to acquire related certifications.  Toyota has been advancing activities to clarify its supply chain and identify smelters using the Cobalt Reporting Template, or CRT, provided by RMI. As of March 2020, the supply chain related to batteries, the primary component in which cobalt is used, has largely been clarified, with several smelters identified.Human RightsSupply Chain Messages from the Outside Directors  Corporate Governance  Capital Strategy  The Environment  Safety   Quality, Information Security, and Privacy  Human Rights and Supply Chains  Diversity and Inclusion   Employees, Safety and Health, and Social Contribution Activities  Risk Management and Compliance\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT40Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataDiversity and InclusionFundamental ApproachToyota’s strength lies in our capacity to respect our employees’ abilities to think and promote transfor­mation involving every member. Toward the ­transformation from an automotive company into a mobility company to leverage recent technical innovations centered on CASE, this capacity is growing increasingly important as we continue to create innovations steadily in existing areas while taking on challenges in new areas. Amid such an environment, Toyota considers diversity and inclusion to be one of the key elements of our business infrastructure, and we are working to create an attractive workplace where employees with wide-ranging skills and values, irrespective of gender, age, nationality, race, ethnicity, creed, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, disability, marital status or the presence of children, can demonstrate their abilities to the fullest and achieve self-realization. In order to become a company that is needed and chosen by society, we are promoting collaboration with a wide variety of partners both inside and outside the company while putting into practice the values Toyota has embraced since our founding, such as the attitude of humbly learning and taking on challenges from the ­customer’s viewpoint.Women’s Participation in the WorkplaceAlthough we have constantly striven to nurture a corporate culture where all employees including women can demonstrate their full potential across our operation around the world, we recognize that gender diversity has been an issue, particularly at Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan.  In 2002, we started initiatives at Toyota Motor Corporation centered on expanding and estab­lishing measures to support women who are trying to balance work and childcare. Then, in 2012, we began focusing on initiatives for creating a work environment that would help women gain motivation and supporting their participation (especially the development of female managers).Initiatives to Empower Persons with Disabilities We provide various work opportunities to those with disabilities based on the concept of a harmo­nious society in which all persons with or without disabilities work and live together in harmony. We offer a variety of support to enable people with disabilities to work energetically, utilizing their abilities to the full.  For example, we have assigned a job consul­tant to each office, created a consultation hotline that ensures privacy, and introduced a special holiday system that can be used by employees when going to hospital or other clinics. To ensure that people with disabilities are given fair opportu­nities, we send with them sign language interpreters, provide a variety of support tools and make workplace improvements as needed.(Our employment rate of people with disabilities, including those serving at a special subsidiary, is 2.46% as of June 2021.)  Creating a Work Environment “Toyota Loops”Toyota Loops Corporation began operation in April 2009 with 28 people with disabilities and received certification from the Minister of Health, Labour and Welfare as a special subsidiary of Toyota Motor Corporation in October of that year.  Toyota Loops primarily handles work that is outsourced from Toyota such as internal printing, mail services, enclosing catalogues and document digitization, performing a variety of office support tasks. As of June 2021, Toyota Loops employed 340 persons with disabilities. The number of support staff has also been increased to eliminate or reduce any anxieties that employees may have regarding their health or work.Toyota Loops Employees Participating in DevelopmentAs a form of work and contribution uniquely available to people with disabilities, some of the Toyota Loops employees participate in the devel­opment of assisted mobility vehicles. For example, they have participated in evaluations (evaluating ease of getting in and out with a wheelchair) for vehicle development and provided opinions on aspects of the development of automated driving vehicles.LGBT-related InitiativesToyota has launched initiatives with the aim of creating workplaces with a good understanding, awareness and inclusion of LGBT people.  At Toyota Motor Corporation, prohibition on discrimination or harassment of LGBT people has been incorporated into the employee behavioral guidelines, and we no longer require new graduates to fill in their sex on their job application sheets. We have been introducing measures related to facilities, such as establishing an ­internal harassment consultation hotline and allocating dedicated toilets for LGBT people at Head Office and the Nagoya office. Starting from July 2020, we have introduced revised internal systems to allow employees in same-sex marriages or common-law marriages to use the same internal benefit ­systems as those in legal marriages (holidays, employee benefits, etc.).Promotion of Female Employee Participation: Our Challenge and Course of Action (Toyota Motor Corporation)Our Challenge The ratio of females in managerial positions is lowTargetThe number of females in managerial positions in 2014 to be increased fourfold by 2025, and fivefold by 2030Our Courseof ActionHiring To maintain certain hiring rates for female graduates (40% or above for administrative positions and 10% or above for engineering positions) and the active hiring of women throughout the year System DevelopmentThe creation of a system that reports on the progress of female training in each department to our board members Employee Development Action PlanThe development and implementation of a plan for individual employee development action plan as well as the utilization of a mentoring system Networking Host a global women’s conference and symposium that the managerial class and female promotion candidates can participate in Social RecognitionIn May 2021, Toyota Motor North America was ranked seventh in the comprehen­sive category of the “Top 50 Companies For Diversity 2021,” a diversity ranking sponsored by U.S.-based Diversity Inc.

Management and Compliance\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT42Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate DataEmployees, Safety and Health, and Social Contribution Activities Fundamental Approach Toward achieving transformation into a mobility company, Toyota is committed to both “realizing advanced monozukuri (manufacturing) with higher quality and efficiency based on Toyota Production System (TPS)” and “taking on challenges in new areas.” To this end, Toyota encourages its ­employees to reexamine their workstyles and hone their individual abilities, thereby enhancing the workplace structures.   Toyota also seeks employees equipped with both the ability to act and empathy,* and promotes the recruitment, training, and evaluation of employees based on these abilities. In this process, Toyota identifies the roles and abilities of each individual, ensuring the placement of the right person in the right position regardless of their nationality, gender, year of joining Toyota, form of recruitment, academic background, job type, and other factors, with the aim of enhancing the competitiveness of the company and its organizations.* \u0007Empathy: The ability to make efforts for others, such as customers and teammates, and the ability to learn respectfully from others and keep improvingRecruitmentTo hire an ideal candidate profile, Toyota has revised its conventional recruitment course as follows: 1  Recruitment criteria • \u0007To accelerate the introduction of workstyles based on teamwork and alliances in preparation for the launch of mobility services, recruit more people who are attractive for other employees to work with. • \u0007Place greater emphasis in recruitment on empathy and the passion to realize their dream at Toyota. 2  Enhancing mid-career recruitment • \u0007To introduce external knowledge and promote the reexamination of work processes and workstyles, increase mid-career hires from 10% to 34% (FY2021 result). The medium-term target is to increase mid-career hires to 50%. (Administrative and engineering positions) • \u0007Introduce referrals (introduction by Toyota employees) and other new means of recruitment.3  \u0007Hiring new graduates with diverse backgrounds • \u0007To ensure diversity in our employees, hire persons with empathy who passionately want to work at Toyota, regardless of their school or academic background. • \u0007Promote the recruitment of diverse people from universities from which no graduates have previously been hired by Toyota, technical colleges, vocational schools and high schools.4  Course-specific recruitment of new graduates • \u0007To accelerate the development of professional human resources, hire students who have a concrete vision of what they want to do at Toyota and determine the course they will be assigned to at the time of recruitment, thereby ensuring the recruitment of diverse human resources suited to the characteristics of specific workplaces, such as with IT-related personnel.Evaluation of and Feedback to EmployeesThe work roles of Toyota employees and the main focus of their work are to be fulfilled in accordance with policies. Evaluation and feedback are based on close communications between subordinates and superiors.  Specifically, roles and main focus are deter­mined at the beginning of each fiscal year and employees consult with their supervisors periodi­cally. Through these consultations, supervisors assess the employees’ self-evaluations and provide feedback. Repeating this cycle leads to employees’ capacity development. In addition, we carry out 360-degree feedback for the purpose of employee growth. By giving employees feedback on their strengths and weaknesses from people working with them, we help them reflect on their own actions and make improvements.   The revision of our personnel system in 2019 brought a shift in the system, allowing hard workers to be rewarded regardless of age or qualifications. Furthermore, in 2020, we introduced a system capable of centrally managing employees’ individual information, including employee ­evaluations, the results of consultations with their supervisors and questionnaire results regarding workplace ­management. This system has made it possible to refer to each employee’s previous evaluations, personnel information and stated intent, thereby enhancing the development and allocation of employees with consistency through job assignment based on a better understanding of employee aptitude and intent. Results for each half year are reflected in bonuses and performance abilities demonstrated over the past year are reflected in salary raises for the following year.Global Employee DevelopmentTo develop employees capable of implementing the Toyota Philosophy globally, Toyota is providing training through global executive development, along with human resource development undertaken by Toyota Motor Corporation in Japan and human resource ­development undertaken by affiliates in other regions.Global Executive Human Resource DevelopmentThe Global 21 Program is to provide skilled employees around the world with knowledge suitable for global Toyota executives and to exercise their strengths to the best of their ability in their respective areas of responsibility.   The program comprises the following three pillars. 1  \u0007Indication of management philosophy and expectations of executives Disseminating Toyota Philosophy and incorporating it into global personnel system and training. 2  Human resource management Applying appropriate personnel evaluation stan­dards and processes in each region based on Toyota’s common values3  Assignment deployment and training programs Global assignments and executive training are carried out.Fundamental ApproachToyota’s mission, as defined by the Toyota Philosophy, is “Producing Happiness for All.” To this end, we conduct corporate activities based on the concept that all people working for Toyota, including our employees, suppliers, and in-plant contractors, can stay physically and mentally healthy and continue to play an active role in a safe work environment. While health and safety policies and KPIs are being formulated by the company safety and health supervising manager, efforts are made at all workplaces in all regions to improve their safety and health activities in line with these policies. The results of these efforts, including the status of the occurrence of diseases and accidents, are reported at the Management Meeting. Response to Infectious DiseasesToyota positions preventing the spread of COVID-19 novel coronavirus and responding properly to the occurrence of infection as an urgent issue and is working to address this issue in view of the impact not only on its own business activities but also on society.  Our measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19 therefore place the highest priority on the safety and security of our employees and their families, customers, suppliers, and all other stakeholders.Workplace VaccinationIn June 2021, to help as many local people as possible get vaccinated as soon as possible, Toyota launched its workplace vaccination program for approximately 80,000 persons, including its employees, suppliers, and in-plant contractors. Toyota has a long history of social contribution that traces back to the desire of Sakichi Toyoda—the father of Toyota Motor Corporation’s founder, Kiichiro Toyoda—to support inventions that would enrich people’s lives.   Kiichiro and his team, who together built Toyota’s automotive business, kept this spirit of social contribution alive after Sakichi’s death, espousing the concepts of contributing to the development and welfare of the country and remembering to always be grateful. These con­cepts were eventually woven into the Five Main Principles of Toyoda. In various forms, this spirit of social contribution has been handed down to today.  We have identified the areas that we will focus on: a “harmonious society”; “human asset devel­opment” and “community co-creation” aimed at achieving the SDGs; and “Mobility for All,” which Toyota is working to promote through our main business. In these areas, we will contribute to establishing a global society in which everyone can live a rich and dynamic life.   For the issues in each area, we all have a sense of ownership and take action on a genchi genbutsu (onsite, hands-on experience) basis. We will work together with our partners who share the same aspirations for the future in addressing issues that are difficult to solve solely by ourselves.Details of our social contribution activities EmployeesSocial Contribution Activities Safety and HealthA Case Study: Response to the COVID-19 PandemicHow it happened: Toyota Production System Leads to 100-fold Increase in Protective Gown ProductionResponse to the COVID-19 pandemic: Supporting the manufacture of protective gowns Messages from the Outside Directors  Corporate Governance  Capital Strategy  The Environment  Safety   Quality, Information Security, and Privacy  Human Rights and Supply Chains  Diversity and Inclusion   Employees, Safety and Health, and Social Contribution Activities  Risk Management and Compliance\fTOYOTA MOTOR CORPORATION INTEGRATED REPORT43Message from the PresidentThe Source of  Our Value Creation:  What Makes Us ToyotaValue Creation Story:  Working toward the Mobility Society of the FutureBusiness Foundations  for Value CreationCorporate Data  Through this process of BCP formulation and review, we aim to develop risk-resilient ­organizations, workplaces, and individuals.Building a Disaster-resilient Supply ChainToyota provides disaster recovery support in the following order of priority: (1) Humanitarian aid; (2) Early recovery of the affected area; (3) Restoration of Toyota’s operations and production. Since the Great East Japan Earthquake, we have worked with suppliers in each country and region to build a disaster-resilient supply chain by sharing supply chain information and setting up measures for prompt initial action and early recovery.Fundamental ApproachThe Guiding Principles at Toyota state that Toyota shall “honor the language and spirit of the law of every country and region, and undertake open and fair business activities to be a strong corporate citizen of the world.” Toyota believes that by adhering to this principle in its actions, it can fulfill its corporate social responsibility and ensure compliance.  The Toyota Code of Conduct outlines the basic frame of mind that all Toyota personnel should adopt. It sets forth concrete guidelines to assist them in upholding the Guiding Principles at Toyota and doing their part to ensure that Toyota carries out its corporate social responsibility. A booklet containing the Toyota Code of Conduct is ­distributed to all employees as part of efforts to ensure compliance.Toyota Code of Conduct Bribery and Corruption Prevention MeasuresToyota adopted the Anti-bribery Guidelines for internal divisions and business partners in 2012 to promote the eradication of bribery and corruption. In addition to prohibiting the bribery of public Risk Management and Compliance Key Compliance Enforcement Initiatives Compliance training To ensure that awareness of compliance extends from top management to each employee, Toyota provides compliance training at career milestones, such as upon hiring, promotion, and foreign assignment.Business Compliance SeminarPersonnel from related specialist divisions hold the Business Compliance Seminar every year, providing lectures on laws and regula­tions that employees must understand when carrying out their work.Legal Handbook for Corporate OfﬁcersThe Legal Handbook for Corporate Ofﬁcers is posted on the Company intranet, and relevant explanations are provided for newly appointed ofﬁcers.Individual training Individual training is carried out in the form of e-learning and lectures provided in response to individual divisions’ needs and requests.Risk ManagementComplianceFundamental ApproachAmid a period of tremendous change in the conditions and priorities of the automotive industry, including the push toward carbon neutrality and CASE, Toyota is always taking on new challenges and has been working to reinforce its risk man­agement structure to handle the corresponding increase in uncertainty. Toyota has appointed a Chief Risk Officer (CRO) and Deputy Chief Risk Officer (DCRO) charged with global risk manage­ment. Under the supervision of the Board of Directors, the CRO and DCRO are working to prevent and mitigate the impact of risks that could arise in Toyota’s global business activities.  Beneath the CRO and DCRO are Regional CROs appointed to manage risk management in specific regions. At head office departments (such as Accounting and Purchasing), risk management by function is assigned to chief officers and risk managers of individual divisions, while at in-house companies, risk management by product is assigned to the company presidents and risk managers of individual divisions. This structure enables coordination and cooperation between the regional head offices and sections. Business Continuity Management at ToyotaFollowing the Great East Japan Earthquake and other major disasters, Toyota has in the past been unable to continue production for long stretches of time, causing difficulties for customers. Based on these experiences, to prepare for such emergencies, we formulate business continuity plans (BCPs) for quickly restoring business operations using limited resources. Toyota works to constantly improve the practical effectiveness of its BCPs through the implementation of a PDCA cycle, including training. These activities constitute our business continuity management (BCM), promoted through coordination among employees and their families, Toyota Group companies and suppliers, and Toyota.officials, the Guidelines include stipulations that prohibit bribery and corrupt practices involving others who are not public officials and require the preparation and retention of accurate accounting records, the reporting of any improprieties discov­ered, and cooperation with investigations. Through these and other measures, we strive to prevent bribery and corruption. Anti-bribery Guidelines Taxation-related InitiativesSince its founding, Toyota has aspired to enrich peoples’ lives through car making and to enrich local economies by creating employment and paying taxes as a corporate presence firmly rooted in local communities.  Toyota seeks to achieve sustainable financial performance through the Toyota Production System (TPS) and cost reduction and commits to its responsibility to making appropriate tax pay­ments as the most basic form of social contribu­tion in the communities in which it operates. Tax Policy “Speak Up” HotlineToyota’s “Speak Up” Hotline enables quick and appropriate responses to workplace- and work-related concerns, complaints, or questions that employees and other relevant parties may have. We promote awareness of the hotline using the Company intranet and various other media. Consultations can be submitted through a law firm, the Company website, email, telephone, or other means. For topics related to employees or workplaces, the hotline is also open to third parties, including employees’ family members and business partners, in addition to employees.  The content of a consultation is passed to the division responsible either anonymously or openly, as requested by the hotline user, and is investigated carefully to ensure that hotline users who wish to remain anonymous cannot be identified. If the results of the investigation indicate an issue, a response is implemented immediately.(Hotline consultations handled in fiscal 2021: 624)Checks to Enhance ComplianceEvery year, we implement checks including global subsidiaries, to enhance compliance. Fields to be checked are selected by assessing risk levels and importance to Toyota. In fiscal 2021, checks were carried out to examine compliance with the Antimonopoly Law, bribery/corruption prevention, compliance with the Act on the Protection of Personal Information, and other topics. Issues or matters requiring improvement identified through checks are incorporated into the next fiscal year’s action plans to ensure ongoing improvement and engagement after the checks conclude.

A key problemin news recommendation is learning accurateuser representations to capture their interests.Users usually have both long-term preferencesand short-term interests.However, existingnews recommendation methods usually learnsingle representations of users, which may beinsufﬁcient. In this paper, we propose a neu-ral news recommendation approach which canlearn both long- and short-term user represen-tations. The core of our approach is a newsencoder and a user encoder. In the news en-coder, we learn representations of news fromtheir titles and topic categories, and use atten-tion network to select important words. In theuser encoder, we propose to learn long-termuser representations from the embeddings oftheir IDs.In addition, we propose to learnshort-term user representations from their re-cently browsed news via GRU network. Be-sides, we propose two methods to combinelong-term and short-term user representations.The ﬁrst one is using the long-term user repre-sentation to initialize the hidden state of theGRU network in short-term user representa-tion.The second one is concatenating bothlong- and short-term user representations asa uniﬁed user vector. Extensive experimentson a real-world dataset show our approach caneffectively improve the performance of neuralnews recommendation.1IntroductionOnline news platforms such as MSN News1 andGoogle News2 which aggregate news from varioussources and distribute them to users have gained*This work was done when the ﬁrst author was an internin Microsoft Research Asia.1https://www.msn.com/news2https://news.google.com/2017 NBA Championship Celebration From WarriorsRami Malek Wins the 2019 OscarOklahoma City Thunder vs. Golden State Warriors Bohemian Rhapsody Is Highest-Grossing Musician Biopic Ever 𝑡𝑡1𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖𝑡𝑡𝑖𝑖+1𝑡𝑡𝑗𝑗……Figure 1: An illustrative example of long-term andshort-term interests in news reading.huge popularity and attracted hundreds of millionsof users (Das et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2018).However, massive news are generated everyday,making it impossible for users to read throughall news (Lian et al., 2018). Thus, personalizednews recommendation is very important for onlinenews platforms to help users ﬁnd their interestedcontents and alleviate information overload (Lavieet al., 2010; Zheng et al., 2018).Learning accurate user representations is criti-cal for news recommendation (Okura et al., 2017).Existing news recommendation methods usuallylearn a single representation for each user (Okuraet al., 2017; Lian et al., 2018; Wu et al., 2019).For example, Okura et al. (2017) proposed to learnrepresentations of news using denoising autoen-coder and learn representations of users from theirbrowsed news using GRU network (Cho et al.,2014). However, it is very difﬁcult for RNN net-works such as GRU to capture the entire informa-tion of very long news browsing history. Wanget al. (2018) proposed to learn the representa-tions of news using knowledge-aware convolu-tional neural network (CNN), and learn the repre-sentations of users from their browsed news basedon the similarities between the candidate news andthe browsed news. However, this method needsto store the entire browsing history of each userin the online news recommendation stage, whichmay bring huge challenge to the storage and maycause heavy latency.\f337Our work is motivated by the observation thatthe interests of online users in news are very di-verse.Some user interests may last for a longtime and are consistent for the same user (Li et al.,2014).For example, as shown in Fig. 1, if auser is a fan of “Golden State Warriors”, this usermay tend to read many basketball news about thisNBA team for several years. We call this kind ofuser preferences as long-term interest. In addition,many user interests may evolve with time and maybe triggered by speciﬁc contexts or temporal de-mands. For example, in Fig. 1, the browsing of thenews on movie “Bohemian Rhapsody” causes theuser reading several related news such as “RamiMalek Wins the 2019 Oscar” since “Rami Malek”is an important actor in this movie, although thisuser may never read news about “Rami Malek” be-fore. We call this kind of user interests as short-term interest.Thus, both long-term and short-term user interests are important for personalizednews recommendation, and distinguishing long-term user interests from short-term ones may helplearn more accurate user representations.In this paper, we propose a neural news rec-ommendation approach with both long- and short-term user representations (LSTUR). Our approachcontains two major components, i.e., a news en-coder and a user encoder. The news encoder isused to learn representations of news articles fromtheir titles and topic categories. We apply attentionmechanism to the news encoder to learn informa-tive news representations by selecting importantwords. The user encoder consists of two modules,i.e., a long-term user representation (LTUR) mod-ule and a short-term user representation (STUR)module. In STUR, we use a GRU network to learnshort-term representations of users from their re-cently browsing news.In LTUR, we learn thelong-term representations of users from the em-beddings of their IDs.In addition, we proposetwo methods to combine the short-term and long-term user representations. The ﬁrst one is usingthe long-term user representations to initialize thehidden state of GRU network in the STUR model.The second one is concatenating the long-tern andshort-term user representations as a uniﬁed uservector. We conducted extensive experiments on areal-world dataset. The experimental results showour approach can effectively improve the perfor-mance of news recommendation and consistentlyoutperform many baseline methods.2Related WorksPersonalized news recommendation is an impor-tant task in natural language processing ﬁeld andhas wide applications (Zheng et al., 2018). It iscritical for news recommendation methods to learnaccurate news and user representations (Wanget al., 2018). Many conventional news recommen-dation methods rely on manual feature engineer-ing to build news and user representations (Phelanet al., 2009; Liu et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010; Sonet al., 2013; Li et al., 2014; Bansal et al., 2015;Lian et al., 2018). For example, Liu et al. (2010)proposed to use the topic categories and interestsfeatures predicted by a Bayesian model to repre-sent news, and use the click distribution features ofnews categories to represent users. Li et al. (2014)used a Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) (Bleiet al., 2003) model to generate topic distributionfeatures as the news representations. They repre-sented a session by using the topic distribution ofbrowsed news in this session, and the representa-tions of users were built from their session repre-sentations weighted by the time. However, thesemethods heavily rely on manual feature engineer-ing, which needs massive domain knowledge tocraft. In addition, the contexts and orders of wordsin news are not incorporated, which are importantfor understanding the semantic meanings of newsand learning representations of news and users.In recent years, several deep learning meth-ods were proposed for personalized news rec-ommendation (Wang et al., 2018; Okura et al.,2017; Zheng et al., 2018). For example, Okuraet al. (2017) proposed to learn representations ofnews from news bodies using denoising autoen-coder, and learn representations of users fromthe representations of their browsed news usinga GRU network. Wang et al. (2018) proposed tolearn representations of news from their titles viaa knowledge-aware CNN network, and learn rep-resentations of users from the representations oftheir browsed news articles weighted by their sim-ilarities with the candidate news. Wu et al. (2019)proposed to learn news and user representationswith personalized word- and news-level attentionnetworks, which exploits the embedding of userID to generate the query vector for the attentions.However, these methods usually learn a single rep-resentation vector for each user, and cannot dis-tinguish the long-term preferences and short-terminterests of users in reading news. Thus, the user\f338representations learned in these methods may beinsufﬁcient for news recommendation. Differentfrom these methods, our approach can learn bothlong-term and short-term user representations ina uniﬁed framework to capture the diverse inter-ests of users for personalized neural new commen-dation. Extensive experiments on the real-worlddataset validate the effectiveness of our approachand the advantage over many baseline methods.3Our ApproachIn this section, we present our neural news rec-ommendation approach with long- and short-termuser representations (LSTUR). Our approach con-tains two major components, i.e., a news encoderto learn representations of news and a user encoderto learn representations of users. Next, we intro-duce each component in detail.3.1News EncoderThe news encoder is used to learn representationsof news from their titles, topic and subtopic cat-egories. The architecture of the news encoder inour approach is illustrated in Fig. 2. There are twosub-modules in the news encoder, i.e., a title en-coder and a topic encoder.The title encoder is used to learn news repre-sentations from titles. There are three layers in thetitle encoder. The ﬁrst layer is word embedding,which is used to convert a news title from a wordsequence into a sequence of dense semantic vec-tors. Denote the word sequence in a news title tas t = [w1, w2, . . . , wN], where N is the length ofthis title. It is transformed into [w1, w2, . . . , wN]via a word embedding matrix.The second layer in title encoder is a convolu-tional neural network (CNN) (LeCun et al., 2015).Local contexts are very useful for understandingthe semantic meaning of news titles. For exam-ple, in the news title “Next season of super bowlgames”, the local contexts of “bowl” such as “su-per” and “games” are very important for inferringthat it belongs to a sports event name. Thus, weapply a CNN network to learn contextual wordrepresentations by capturing the local context in-formation. Denote the contextual representationof wi as ci, which is computed as follows:ci = ReLU(C × w[i−M:i+M] + b),(1)where w[i−M:i+M] is the concatenation of the em-beddings of words between position i −M and𝒗𝑎ଵ𝑎ேPaddingPaddingWord Embedding𝒘𝟏𝒘𝟐𝒘𝑵ି𝟏𝒘𝑵𝒄𝟏𝒄𝟐𝒄𝑵ି𝟏𝒄𝑵𝑤ଵ𝑤ଶ𝑤ேିଵ𝑤ே𝒆𝒕𝑎ଶ𝑎ேିଵTopic EmbeddingSubtopicEmbeddingNews TopicNews SubtopicNews Title𝒆𝒗𝒆𝒔𝒗⨁⨁𝒆Figure 2: The framework of the news encoder.i + M. C and b are the parameters of the convo-lutional ﬁlters in CNN, and M is the window size.The third layer is an attention network (Bah-danau et al., 2015). Different words in the samenews title may have different informativeness forrepresenting news. For instance, in the news ti-tle “The best NBA moments in 2018”, the word“NBA” is very informative for representing thisnews since it is an important indication of sportsnews, while the word “2018” is less informative.Thus, we employ a word-level attention networkto select important words in news titles to learnmore informative news representations. The at-tention weight αi of the i-th word is formulatedas follows:ai = tanh(v × ci + vb),αi =exp(ai)PNj=1 exp(aj),(2)where v and vb are the trainable parameters.The ﬁnal representation of a news title t is thesummation of its contextual word representationsweighted by their attention weights as follows:et =NXi=1αici.(3)The topic encoder module is used to learn newsrepresentations from its topics and subtopics. Onmany online news platforms such as MSN news,news articles are usually labeled with a topic cate-gory (e.g., “Sports”) and a subtopic category (e.g.,“Football NFL”) to help target user interests. Thetopic and subtopic categories of news are also in-formative for learning representations of news andusers. They can reveal the general and detailedtopics of the news, and reﬂect the preferences ofusers. For example, if a user browsed many newsarticles with the “Sports” topic category, then we\f339User Click History𝒆ଵGRUNewsEncoderGRUGRU……NewsEncoderNewsEncoder𝒖௟𝒆ଶ𝒆௞𝒆௫𝒖𝑐ଵ𝑐ଶ𝑐௞𝑐௫Dot ProductUser EmbeddingNewsEncoderCandidateNewsScore(a) LSTUR-ini.𝒆ଵGRUNewsEncoderGRUGRU……NewsEncoderNewsEncoder𝒖௟𝒆ଶ𝒆௞𝒆௫𝒖௦𝑐ଵ𝑐ଶ𝑐௞𝑐௫User Click HistoryDot ProductUser EmbeddingNewsEncoderCandidate NewsConcatenationScore⨁(b) LSTUR-con.Figure 3: The two frameworks of our LSTUR approach.can infer this user is probably interested in sports,and it may be effective to recommend candidatenews in the “Sports” topic category to this user.To incorporate the topic and subtopic informationinto news representation, we propose to learn therepresentations of topics and subtopics from theembeddings of their IDs, as shown in Fig. 2. De-note ev and esv as the representations of topic andsubtopic. The ﬁnal representation of a news arti-cle is the concatenation of the representations ofits title, topic and subtopic, i.e., e = [et, ev, esv].3.2User EncoderThe user encoder is used to learn representationsof users from the history of their browsed news. Itcontains two modules, i.e., a short-term user repre-sentation model (STUR) to capture user’s tempo-ral interests, and a long-term user representationmodel (LTUR) to capture user’s consistent prefer-ences. Next, we introduce them in detail.3.2.1Short-Term User RepresentationOnline users may have dynamic short-term inter-ests in reading news articles, which may be inﬂu-enced by speciﬁc contexts or temporal informationdemands. For example, if a user just reads a newsarticle about “Mission: Impossible 6 – Fallout”,and she may want to know more about the actor“Tom Cruise” in this movie and click news arti-cles related to “Tom Cruise”, although she is nothis fan and may never read his news before. Wepropose to learn the short-term representations ofusers from their recent browsing history to capturetheir temporal interests, and use gated recurrentnetworks (GRU) (Cho et al., 2014) network to cap-ture the sequential news reading patterns (Okuraet al., 2017).Denote news browsing sequencefrom a user sorted by timestamp in ascending or-der as C = {c1, c2, . . . , ck}, where k is the lengthof this sequence. We apply the news encoder toobtain the representations of these browsed arti-cles, denoted as {e1, e2, . . . , ek}. The short-termuser representation is computed as follows:rt = σ(W r[ht−1, et]),zt = σ(W z[ht−1, et]),˜ht = tanh(W ˜h[rt ⊙ht−1, et]),ht = zt ⊙ht + (1 −zt) ⊙˜ht,(4)where σ is the sigmoid function, ⊙is the item-wise product, W r, W z and W ˜h are the param-eters of the GRU network. The short-term userrepresentation is the last hidden state of the GRUnetwork, i.e., us = hk.3.2.2Long-Term User RepresentationsBesides the temporal interests, online users mayalso have long-term interests in reading news. Forexample, a basketball fan may tend to browsemany sports news related to NBA in several years.Thus, we propose to learn long-term representa-tions of users to capture their consistent prefer-ences. In our approach the long-term user repre-sentations are learned from the embeddings of theuser IDs, which are randomly initialized and ﬁne-tuned during model training. Denote u as the ID ofa user and W u as the look-up table for long-termuser representation, the long-term user representa-tion of this user is ul = W u[u].3.2.3Long- and Short-Term UserRepresentationIn this section, we introduce two methods to com-bine the long-term and short-term user presenta-tions for uniﬁed user representation, which areshown in Fig. 3.\f340The ﬁrst method is using the long-term userrepresentation to initialize the hidden state of theGRU network in the short-term user representationmodel, as shown in Fig. 3a. We denote this methodas LSTUR-ini. We use the last hidden state of theGRU network as the ﬁnal user representation. Thesecond method is concatenating the long-term userrepresentation with the short-term user represen-tation as the ﬁnal user representation, as shown inFig. 3b. We denote this method as LSTUR-con.3.3Model TrainingFor online news recommendation services whereuser and news representations can be computed inadvance, the scoring function should be as simpleas possible to reduce latency. Motivated by (Okuraet al., 2017), we use the simple dot production tocompute the news click probability score. Denotethe representation of a user u as u and the repre-sentation of a candidate news article ex as ex, theprobability score s(u, cx) of this user clicking thisnews is computed as s(u, cx) = u⊤ex.Motivated by (Huang et al., 2013) and (Zhaiet al., 2016), we propose to use the negative sam-pling technique for model training. For each newsbrowsed by a user (regarded as a positive sam-ple), we randomly sample K news articles fromthe same impression which are not clicked by thisuser as negative samples. Our model will jointlypredict the click probability scores of the positivenews and the K negative news. In this way, thenews click prediction problem is reformulated asa pseudo K + 1-way classiﬁcation task. We mini-mize the summation of the negative log-likelihoodof all positive samples during training, which canbe formulated as follows:−PXi=1logexp(s(u, cpi ))exp(s(u, cpi )) + PKk=1 exp(s(u, cni,k)),(5)where P is the number of positive training sam-ples, and cni,k is the k-th negative sample in thesame session with the i-th positive sample.Since not all users can be incorporated in newsrecommendation model training (e.g., the newcoming users), it is not appropriate to assume allusers have long-term representations in our mod-els in the prediction stage. In order to handle thisproblem, in the model training stage, we randomlymask the long-term representations of users witha certain probability p. When we mask the long-term representations, all the dimensions are set tozero. Thus, the long-term user representation inour LSTUR approach can be reformulated as:ul = M · W u[u], M ∼B(1, 1 −p),(6)where B is Bernoulli distribution, and M is a ran-dom variable that subject to B(1, 1−p). We ﬁnd inexperiments that this trick for model training canimprove the performance of our approach.4Experiments4.1Dataset and Experimental SettingsSince there is no off-the-shelf dataset for news rec-ommendation, we built one by ourselves throughcollecting logs from MSN News3 in four weeksfrom December 23rd, 2018 to January 19th, 2019.We used the logs in the ﬁrst three weeks for modeltraining, and those in the last week for test. Wealso randomly sampled 10% of logs from the train-ing set as the validation data. For each sample,we collected the browsing history in last 7 days tolearn short-term user representations. The detaileddataset statistics are summarized in Table 1.# of users25,000# of users in training set22,938# of news38,501Avg. # of words per title9.98# of imprs393,191# of positive samples492,185NP ratio418.74# of negative samples9,224,537Table 1: Statistics of the dataset in our experiments.In our experiments, we used the pretrainedGloVe embedding5 (Pennington et al., 2014) as theinitialization of word embeddings. The word em-bedding dimension is 200. The number of ﬁltersin CNN network is 300, and the window size ofthe ﬁlters in CNN network is set to 3. We applieddropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) to each layer inour approach to mitigate overﬁtting. The dropoutrate is 0.2. The default value of long-term user rep-resentation masking probability p for model train-ing is 0.5. We used Adam (Kingma and Ba, 2014)to optimize the model, and the learning rate was0.01. The batch size is set to 400. The numberof negative samples for each positive sample is4. These hyper-parameters were all selected ac-cording to the results on validation set. We used3https://www.msn.com/en-us/news4The ratio of the negative sample number to the positivesample number.5http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip\f341impression-based ranking metrics to evaluate theperformance, including area under the ROC curve(AUC), mean reciprocal rank (MRR), and nor-malized discounted cumulative gain (nDCG). Werepeated each experiment for 10 times indepen-dently, and reported the average results with 0.95conﬁdence probability.4.2Performance EvaluationWe evaluate the performance of our approach bycomparing it with several baseline methods, in-cluding:• LibFM (Rendle, 2012), a state-of-the-art ma-trix factorization method which is widelyused in recommendation. In our experiments,the user features are the concatenation ofTF-IDF features extracted from the browsednews titles, and the normalized count featuresfrom the topics and subtopics of the browsednews. The features for news consists of TF-IDF features from its title, and one-hot vec-tors of its topic and subtopic. The input toLibFM is the concatenation of user featuresand features of candidate news.• DeepFM (Guo et al., 2017), a widely usedmethod that combines factorization machinesand deep neural networks. We use the samefeatures as LibFM.• Wide & Deep (Cheng et al., 2016), anotherdeep learning based recommendation methodthat combines a wide channel and a deepchannel.Again, the same features withLibFM are used for both channels.• DSSM (Huang et al., 2013), deep structuredsemantic model. The inputs are hashed wordsvia character trigram, where all the browsednews titles are merged as query document.• CNN (Kim, 2014), using CNN with maxpooling to learn news representations fromthe titles of browsed news by keeping themost salient features.• DKN (Wang et al., 2018), a deep news rec-ommendation model which contains CNNand candidate-aware attention on the newsbrowsing histories.• GRU (Okura et al., 2017), learning news rep-resentations by a denoising autoencoder anduser representations by a GRU network.The results of comparing different methods aresummarized in Table 2.We have obtained observations from Table 2.First, the news recommendation methods (e.g.CNN, DKN and LSTUR) which use neural net-works to learn news and user representations cansigniﬁcantly outperform the methods using man-ual feature engineering (e.g.LibFM, DeepFM,Wide & Deep, and DSSM). This is probably be-cause handcrafted features are usually not optimal,and neural networks can capture both global andlocal semantic contexts in news, which are usefulfor learning more accurate news and user repre-sentations for news recommendation.Second, our LSTUR approach outperforms allbaseline methods compared here, including deeplearning models such as CNN, GRU and DKN. OurLSTUR approach can capture both the long-termpreferences and short-term interests to capture thecomplex and diverse user interests in news read-ing, while the baseline methods only learn a singlerepresentation for each user, which is insufﬁcient.In addition, our LSTUR approach uses attentionmechanism in the news encoder to select impor-tant words, which can help learn more informativenews representations.Third, our proposed two methods to learn long-and short-term user representations, i.e., LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, can achieve comparable per-formance and both outperform baseline methods,which validate the effectiveness of these meth-ods. In addtion, the performance of LSTUR-conis more stable than LSTUR-ini, which indicatesthat using the concatenation of both short-termand long-term user representations is capable ofretaining all the information. We also conductedexperiments to explore the performance of com-bining both LSTUR-con and LSTUR-ini in thesame model, but the performance improvement isvery limited, implying that each of them can fullycapture the long- and short-term user interests fornews recommendation.4.3Effectiveness of Long- and Short-TermUser RepresentationIn this section, we conducted several experimentsto explore the effectiveness of our approach inlearning both long-term and short-term user rep-resentations. We compare the performance of ourLSTUR methods with the long-term user represen-tation model LTUR and the short-term user rep-\f342MethodsAUCMRRnDCG@5nDCG@10LibFM56.52 ± 1.3125.53 ± 0.8126.66 ± 1.0434.72 ± 0.95DeepFM58.13 ± 1.6927.01 ± 0.2028.37 ± 0.5736.78 ± 0.62Wide & Deep58.07 ± 0.5527.07 ± 0.3728.51 ± 0.4536.93 ± 0.43DSSM58.43 ± 0.5827.25 ± 0.4928.31 ± 0.6036.91 ± 0.54CNN61.13 ± 0.7729.44 ± 0.7331.44 ± 0.8739.51 ± 0.74DKN61.25 ± 0.7829.47 ± 0.6431.54 ± 0.7939.59 ± 0.67GRU62.69 ± 0.1630.24 ± 0.1332.56 ± 0.1740.55 ± 0.13LSTUR-con63.47 ± 0.1030.94 ± 0.1433.43 ± 0.1341.34 ± 0.13LSTUR-ini63.56 ± 0.4230.98 ± 0.3233.45 ± 0.3941.37 ± 0.36Table 2: The performance of different methods on news recommendation.Figure 4: The effectiveness of incorporating long-ternuser representations (LTUR) and short-term user rep-resentations (STUR).Figure 5: The comparisons of different methods inlearning short-term user representations from recentlybrowsed news articles.resentation model STUR. The results are summa-rized in Fig. 4.From the results we ﬁnd both LTUR and STURare useful for news recommendation, and theSTUR model can outperform the LTUR model.According to the statistics in Table 1, the long-term representations of many users in test dataare unavailable, which leads to relative weak per-formance of LTUR on these users. In addition,combining STUR and LTUR using our two long-and short-term user representation methods, i.e.,LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con, can effectively im-prove the performance. This result validates thatincorporating both long-term and short-term userrepresentations is useful to capture the diverseuser interests more accurately and is beneﬁcial fornews recommendation.4.4Effectiveness of News Encoders in STURIn our STUR model, GRU is used to learn short-term user representations from the recent browsingnews. We explore the effectiveness of GRU in en-coding news by replacing it with several other en-coders, including: 1) Average: using the averageof all the news representations in recent browsinghistory; 2) Attention: the summation of news rep-resentations weighted by their attention weights;3) LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997), re-placing GRU with LSTM. The results are summa-rized in Fig. 5.According to Fig. 5, the sequence-based en-coders (e.g., GRU, LSTM) outperform the Aver-age and Attention based encoders. This is proba-bly because the sequence-based encoders can cap-ture the sequential new reading patterns to learnshort-term representations of users, which is difﬁ-cult for Average and Attention based encoders. Inaddition, GRU achieves better performance thanLSTM. This may be because GRU contains fewerparameters and has lower risk of overﬁtting . Thus,we select GRU as the news encoder in STUR.4.5Effectiveness of News Title EncodersIn this section, we conduct experiments to com-pare different news title encoders.In our ap-proach, the news encoder is a combination ofCNN network and an attention network (denotedas CNN+Att). We compare it with several vari-ants, i.e., CNN, LSTM, and LSTM with attention(LSTM+Att), to validate the effectiveness of our\f343--(a) AUC--(b) nDCG@10Figure 6: The comparisons of different methods in learning news title representations and the effectiveness ofattention machenism in selecting important words.--(a) AUC--(b) nDCG@10Figure 7: The effectiveness of incorporating news topic and subtopic information for news recommendation.approach. The results are summarized in Fig. 6.According to Fig. 6, using attention mechanismin both encoders based on CNN and LSTM canachieve better performance. This is probably be-cause the attention network can select importantwords, which can learn more informative newsrepresentations. In addition, encoders using CNNoutperform those using LSTM. This may be be-cause local contexts in news titles are more impor-tant for learning news representations.4.5.1Effectiveness of News TopicIn this section, we conduct experiments to vali-date the effectiveness of incorporating topic andsubtopic of news in the news encoder. We com-pare the performance of our approach with its vari-ants without topic and/or subtopics. The resultsare shown in Fig. 7.According to Fig. 7, incorporating either top-ics or subtopics can effectively improve the per-formance of our approach. In addition, the newsencoder with subtopics outperforms the news en-coder with topics.This is probably becausesubtopics can provide more ﬁne-grained topic in-formation which is more helpful for news rec-ommendation.Thus, the model with subtopicscan achieve better news recommendation perfor-mance. Moreover, combining topics and subtopicscan further improve the performance of our ap-proach. These results validate the effectiveness ofour approach in exploiting topic information fornews recommendation.4.5.2Inﬂuence of Masking ProbabilityIn this section, we explore the inﬂuence of theprobability p in Eq. (6) for randomly maskinglong-term user representation in model training.We vary the value of p from 0.0 to 0.9 with a stepof 0.1 for both LSTUR-ini and LSTUR-con. Theresults are summarized in Fig. 8.According to Fig. 8, the results of LSTUR-iniand LSTUR-con have similar patterns. The perfor-mance of both methods improves when p increasesfrom 0. When p is too small, the model will tendto overﬁt on the LTUR, since LTUR has many pa-rameters. Thus, the performance is not optimal.However, when p is too large, the performance ofboth methods starts to decline. This may be be-\f3440.00.30.60.963.064.0AUCMRRnDCG@5nDCG@1040.541.50.00.30.60.930.031.032.033.034.0Mask probability p(a) LSTUR-ini.0.00.30.60.963.064.0AUCMRRnDCG@5nDCG@1040.541.50.00.30.60.930.031.032.033.034.0Mask probability p(b) LSTUR-con.Figure 8: The inﬂuence of mask probability p on the performance of our approach.2019 CES Highlights : Innovations in Enviro-Sensing for RobocarsCalifornia dries off after storm batter state for days15 Recipes Inspired By Vintage MoviesTexas State Rep .

Thus, the performance isalso not optimal. A moderate choice on p (e.g.,0.5) is most appropriate for both LSTUR-ini andLSTUR-con methods, which can properly balancethe learning of LTUR and STUR.5Visualization of Attention WeightsIn this section, we visually explore the effective-ness of the word-level attention network in thenews encoder.The attention weights in severalexample news titles are shown in Fig. 9. Fromthe results, we ﬁnd our approach can effectivelyrecognize important words to learn more infor-mative news representations.For example, thewords “Enviro-Sensing” and “Robocars” in theﬁrst news title are assigned high attention weightsbecause these words are indications of news ontechnologies, while the words “2019” and “for”are assigned low attention weights by our ap-proach since they are less informative. These re-sults validate the effectiveness of the attention net-work in the news encoder.6ConclusionIn this paper, we propose a neural news recom-mendation approach which can learn both long-and short-term user representations. The core ofour model is a news encoder and a user encoder.In the news encoder, we learn representations ofnews from their titles and topic categories, and usean attention network to highlight important wordsfor informative representation learning. In the userencoder, we propose to learn long-term represen-tations of users from the embeddings of their IDs.In addition, we learn short-term representations ofusers from their recently browsed news via a GRUnetwork. Besides, we propose two methods to fuselong- and short-term user representations, i.e., us-ing long-term user representation to initialize thehidden state of the GRU network in short-termuser representation, or concatenating both long-and short-term user representations as a uniﬁeduser vector. Extensive experiments on a real-worlddataset collected from MSN news show our ap-proach can effecitively improve the performanceof news recommendation.AcknowledgementThe authors would like to thank Microsoft Newsfor providing technical support and data in the ex-periments, and Jiun-Hung Chen (Microsoft News)and Ying Qiao (Microsoft News) for their supportand discussions.

However, in times of crisis, businesses play a critical role in mobilising resources and providing solutions. Novo Nordisk has worked hard to respond to the challenges, helping people with serious chronic diseases while also supporting society on a broader scale.Novo Nordisk’s highest priority in 2020 was to ensure the safety of our employees and the uninterrupted supply of our life-saving medicines for patients. We achieved this, while also supporting society's response to the pandemic, most notably in Denmark, where our headquarter presence meant we were able to assist the government in the rapid scale-up of coronavirus testing. At the same time, our scientists continued to make significant progress in discovering new therapies of the future, while our global Rising to the challengecommercial organisation embraced an increasingly digital new reality.The world has been through one of the most difficult years in recent human history. Despite the pandemic and the turbulent business environment, Novo Nordisk took important steps towards delivering on our purpose of driving change to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic diseases – a goal we are confident will translate into sustainable and profitable growth.Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  3\fThis does not mean that the road ahead is going to be easy. The pandemic has exacted an immense economic, as well as human, cost on societies and it is inevitable that public finances will remain fragile for many years. Those fiscal constraints will put pressure on businesses that work closely with governments, including the pharmaceutical industry, and we will have to find new ways to ensure that our products are accessible to all those who need them.Beyond COVID-19, two consistent priorities were high on the Board’s agenda in 2020, namely scientific innovation and sustainability – both of which are vital to ensure the future of the company. It is therefore satisfying to see a healthy product pipeline, including the pioneering science that we consider to be the biggest contribution we can make to society. Our research is now more broadly focused as we look to deliver treatments within therapy areas adjacent to our core competencies. Specifically, this means looking beyond semaglutide, the GLP-1 molecule found in our new oral diabetes treat-ment Rybelsus® and the once-weekly injectable Ozempic®. We are exploring novel ways to treat a range of conditions beyond diabetes, including cardiovascular disease – the world’s leading cause of death1 – obesity and most recently also as a potential treatment for Alzheimer’s disease. In tandem with this push into new areas, we are also establishing more external alliances and partner-ships to complement our in-house expertise.Above all, 2020 underscored the need for strong cor-porate values and a shared sense of purpose. We are fortunate that both are well-established across our organisation, empowering our employees to keep delivering for both patients and investors, despite the unprecedented disruptions caused by COVID-19.On behalf of the Board of Directors I would like to offer my thanks to all Novo Nordisk’s employees for their hard work and commitment during the exceptional challenges of 2020; to Lars Fruergaard Jørgensen and his team for leading the company through a turbulent year in such a thoughtful and positive manner; and to our shareholders for their continued support.Helge LundChair of the Board of DirectorsIt is increasingly clear that society expects more from businesses as the world grapples with climate change and environmental degradation, as well as the need for greater equity in healthcare. Indeed, the pandemic has turbocharged many of these issues, with an effective alliance emerging between young people and investors that is prompting companies to pay far more attention to sustainability.At Novo Nordisk, we have been focused on sustainability for many years – but we are determined to continue to raise our game. In the past year we launched a new social responsibility strategy, Defeat Diabetes, and initiated programmes within renewable power and recycling as part of our Circular for Zero environmental strategy.Employees from the Novo Nordisk research department volunteered to contribute to the fight against COVID-19 and, together with staff from the Danish health service, they helped to increase the testing capacity in Denmark.“Above all, 2020 underscored the need for strong corporate values and a shared sense of purpose. We are fortunate that both are well-established across our organisation, empowering our employees to keep delivering for both patients and investors, despite the unprecedented disruptions caused by COVID-19.”1. WHO, The top 10 causes of death (2020)Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  4\fLetter from the CEOThe COVID-19 pandemic has taken a terrible toll around the world – but the pain has not been shared equally. People with underlying conditions have been hit disproportionately hard by the virus, a fact that makes Novo Nordisk’s purpose of driving change to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic diseases more meaningful than ever.Today, one in 11 people in the world has diabetes and if action is not taken to bend the curve, that figure is projected to rise to one in nine by 20451. The risk posed by COVID-19 to people living with diabetes and obesity is a clear wake-up call: we must continue to do more to tackle these diseases or risk vast future damage to millions of lives, as well as to broader societies and economies.We measure our contribution to the fight against diabetes and other serious chronic diseases in our Strategic Aspirations for 2025. Appropriately, after a year as unparalleled as 2020, and as the world acknowledges the hundredth anniversary of the The power of purposediscovery of insulin, the first of these is 'Purpose and sustainability'. Over the past year we have stepped up our commitment to our purpose by launching a new Defeat Diabetes social responsi-bility strategy. This sets out our ambition to accel-erate the prevention of type 2 diabetes, provide access to affordable care for vulnerable patients in every country and innovate to improve lives.Beyond defeating serious chronic diseases, we also aspire to have zero environmental impact.In 2020, we took an important step by achieving our target of using 100% renewable power across global production – a key milestone on the road to our target of zero CO2 emissions from all operations and transport by 2030. ­ 1. IDF Diabetes Atlas, 9th edition, 2019Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  5\fWe now also ask that by the end of the decade, our direct suppliers use only renewable power when supplying us. It has been great to see some of our largest suppliers step up and meet this target already.Despite this encouraging progress, we can only fulfil our purpose and be respected for adding value to society if we deliver on our core contribution of scientific innovation. Thanks to a strategy of targeted investment, our scientists are currently pursuing higher levels of innovation across more therapy areas than at any point in the company’s history. Consequently, I believe we are now well-positioned for success in the short, medium and long term.Within diabetes, we are further raising the in-novation bar with the roll-out of the world’s first once-daily GLP-1 tablet, Rybelsus®, while at the same time working on novel insulins, 100 years after the discovery of the molecule. Our Research & Development (R&D) colleagues are also pursu-ing greater weight loss in obesity, and in 2020 they demonstrated the potential of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the STEP phase 3 clinical trial programme.Crucially, we also broadened our technology platforms and expanded our research into adjacent disease areas in 2020 including cardiovascular disease, non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and Alzheimer’s disease – areas of huge unmet medical need and a great burden for patients, families and society alike.Our continued focus on external innovation led to the significant acquisitions of Corvidia Therapeutics and Emisphere Technologies, strengthening our positions in cutting-edge areas of cardiovascular medicine and drug delivery respectively.Commercially, 2020 was a challenging year as lockdowns reduced the time doctors spent with their patients, leading to fewer initiations of new treatments. Despite this, we expanded our leadership position in the diabetes market in terms of value, keeping us on track to reach a share of more than one third by 2025. Diabetes sales were driven by sales of GLP-1 products (Victoza®, Ozempic® and Rybelsus®), which offset mixed market conditions for insulins. We continued to help more people living with obesity, while making progress with our ambition to secure sustained growth within our Biopharm division thanks to strong demand for our growth hormone and new haemophilia products.I believe that our ability to meet the needs of our millions of patients during the pandemic in 2020 comes as a consequence of our crystal-clear purpose and long-established company values. We are far from done and have many more millions of patients for whom treatment is not accessible today. So now is the time to continue to invest in our people and in our organisation, creating an inclusive, diverse and safe working environment in which colleagues have equal opportunities to thrive and fulfil their potential.Looking to the future, I am confident that our clear corporate strategy will make us a valued partner to society as the world continues on the long road to recovery from the pandemic.In closing, I would like to thank my colleagues around the world for their agility and commitment during this most challenging of years. Special thanks must go to our partners and collaborators, without whom we could not succeed. A sincere thank you goes to our Board of Directors for their continued support and constructive challenging of the organ-isation. Finally, I would like to send a thank you to our shareholders for their continuous support.Lars Fruergaard JørgensenPresident & Chief Executive Officer“Over the past year we have stepped up our commitment to our purpose by launching a new Defeat Diabetes social responsibility strategy.

Threats like the COVID-19 pandemic and climate change mean that 'business as usual' is no longer an option. The stakes are high and we are determined to be a sustainable business by adding value to society and to our future business.The rapid outbreak of COVID-19 during 2020 put the potential vulnerability of people living with diseases, including diabetes and obesity, firmly in the spotlight. At the same time, climate change remains an urgent challenge. These challenges call for corporations to step up and take a leading role in delivering and adopting solutions.In 2020 we addressed these challenges by increasing access to our medicines across the world, pursuing zero environmental impact, and taking steps towards creating a more sustainable and inclusive workplace.Responding to COVID-19During 2020, COVID-19 led to a cascade of critical needs around the world and we used our exper-tise, resources and global reach to contribute to the response. Our highest priority was to ensure the safety of our employees and the uninterrupted supply of life-saving medicines for our patients. In addition, we focused our resources on donations towards global relief efforts and activated our re-search and development organisation to perform COVID-19 testing following a request for support from the Danish government.Leading a sustainable businessOur purpose is to drive change to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic diseases. To maximise our positive impact, we must offer solutions beyond providing medicines to help tackle the global societal challenges of growth in non-communicable diseases, lack of access to affordable care and the impacts of climate change. We are committed to being a sustainable business. To us, this means that we add value to society and to our future business. To achieve this ambition, we do business in a financially, environmentally and socially responsible way, as reflected in our Articles of Association and the Novo Nordisk Way. This approach is integrated into every aspect of our decision-making, in strategies and actions, always keeping in mind what is best in the long term for the patients we serve, our shareholders, our employees, the communities in which we are present and the global society we are part of. ­ With that, we lead towards our Strategic Aspirations within purpose and sustainability. This is what ESG – Environmental, Social and Governance – means to us.Read more about ESG in the following sectionsand in the consolidated ESG statement.Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  11Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Purpose and sustainability  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fPurpose and sustainability Our environmental responsibilityTo get there, we are adopting a circular mindset, designing products that can be re-used or recycled, reshaping our business practice to minimise consumption and eliminate waste, and working with suppliers who share our ambition. We call our environmental strategy Circular for Zero and we measure our progress based on use of resources, emissions and waste. The Circular for Zero strategy incorporates our entire value chain and is based on three pillars: circular supply, circular company and circular products.Circular supplyAs part of our ambition to switch to circular sourcing and procurement, we collaborate with Our environmental strategy, Circular for Zero and 2030 ambitionsCircular supply:Proactive collaboration with suppliers to embed circular thinking for reduced environmental impact across the value chain and move towards circular sourcing and procurementCircular products: Upgrade existing and design new products based on circular principles and solve the end-of-life product waste challenge to  close the resource loopCircular company:Eliminate environmental footprint from operations and drive a circular transition across the company aiming for zero environmental impactEach year, billions of Novo Nordisk tablets, vials and injection pens are distributed to patients and demand for them is growing. This puts us in the front line of some of the most challenging environmental issues including climate change, water and resource scarcity, pollution and plastic waste. Our ambition is bold and simple: to have zero environmental impact.suppliers to encourage them to shift to sustainably sourced materials, thus reducing our environmen-tal impact. In 2020 we set an ambitious target that all our direct suppliers should source 100% renew-able power by 2030 when supplying us. To achieve this, we will work with our suppliers to help them in this transition to renewable power. Successful conversion among our 60,000 suppliers would result in around 300,000 tonnes of CO2 being elim-inated from our direct suppliers each year.Circular companyWe work to reduce our environmental impact across all areas of our operations and transportation. In 2020, total CO2 emissions across our operations and transportation were 170,000 tonnes of CO2, representing a 44% decrease from 2019, due primarily to the implementation of renewable energy projects and impacts on travel from COVID-19.CO2 emissions from operations includes all production facilities, global office buildings and laboratories. In 2020, CO2 emissions from production were 37,000 tonnes CO2, a reduction of 57% versus 2019, primarily due to the implementation of various renewable energy initiatives. These projects include implementation of renewable heat and steam in Kalundborg, wind power in France, Algeria and Russia, and solar power in the US. CO2 emissions from office buildings and laboratories were 8,000 tonnes CO2, a decrease of 38% versus 2019, due primarily to energy-saving projects and COVID-19 shut-downs.Due to COVID-19, CO2 emissions from business flights were reduced to 19,000 tonnes CO2, a reduction of 71% compared with 2019. During 2021, we will focus on ensuring that emissions from business travel are minimised through the promotion of virtual collaboration with both colleagues and stakeholders. CO2 emissions from our company cars in 2020 were 45,000 tonnes CO2, 27% lower than in 2019, primarily due to fewer in-person meetings and less travel as a result of COVID-19. Novo Nordisk is a member of EV100 and has committed to transitioning to 100% electric company cars by 2030. In 2020, CO2 emissions from product distribution were 61,000 tonnes CO2, a decrease of 24% compared with 2019, due to optimisation projects to move products shipped from air to sea freight. At the beginning of the year, we achieved our ambi-tion of sourcing 100% renewable power in our glob-al production when a new solar facility went online Horns Rev 3 wind farm, North Sea, is one of the locations from which we receive renewable power Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  12Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Purpose and sustainability  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fIt is our ambition to have zeroenvironmental impact.

In the process, we became the first pharmaceutical company in the renewable power initiative, RE100, to do this.In 2020, the energy consumption for our opera-tions was 3,191,000 GJ, an increase of 7% com-pared with 2019, primarily due to a new produc-tion site in North Carolina. Energy-saving projects implemented in 2020 within production sites are expected to result in annual savings of 94,000 GJ.Water consumption at production sites was 3,368,000 cubic meters, an increase of 7% compared with 2019 due to the new production site in North Carolina. Four production sites including China and Brazil are in areas subject to water stress or high seasonal variations. These sites accounted for 11% of the total water consumption in 2020, and water consumption at these sites decreased by 15% in 2020, despite adding new production sites. We will continue to focus on reducing water consumption across these sites.We are committed to reducing waste and have a target of sending zero production waste to landfill by 2030. In 2020, production sites had a total of 141,000 tonnes of waste, an increase of 14% compared with 2019. This increase was due to increased production in Kalundborg.93% of waste arising from our production was recycled, converted to biogas or incinerated in waste-to-energy plants. During 2020 less than 1% (1,000 tonnes) of our waste was sent to landfill.Environmental performance 1701,000 tonnes CO2 emissions from operations and transport -44% from 2019100%share of renewable power  for production sites+24 percentage points from 2019<1%of waste from production  sites sent to landfill 0% change from 2019Circular productsWe are working to ensure existing and new products are fit for circularity and have developed a circular design guideline within R&D to reduce the environmental footprint of our devices.As part of Circular for Zero, we are seeking to address the end-of-life challenges associated with many of our medical devices. In late 2020, we initiated a pilot take-back scheme for medical devices in Denmark with the aim of scaling globally in the future. Through recycling our production waste, we have been able to successfully recycle insulin pens, providing materials for the manufacture of lamps and office furniture. We are pursuing greater re-use and recycling of our devices and aspire to achieve this in coming years.“The Danish Association of Pharmacies is very excited to be part of this important take-back project aiming to reduce the environmental impact from used insulin pens, which consist of valuable materials suitable for recycling. By recycling we avoid the negative climate impact from burning the material as normal waste.” – Birthe Søndergaard, Danish Association of PharmaciesRead more about our environmental performance in the consolidated ESG statement in this report and on novonordisk.com.Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  13Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Purpose and sustainability  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fWe are driving change to  Defeat Diabetes by…Purpose and sustainabilityOur social responsibilityAt Novo Nordisk, it is our ambition to be respected for adding value to society. We aim to achieve this by adding value to the communities we are part of, delivering innovative solutions to patients, and by offering an inclusive, diverse, safe and ethical workplace.Today, one in every 11 people in the world is living with diabetes, a figure that is projected to rise to one in nine by 2045 if action is not taken1. Diabetes places a great burden on health systems, and we are committed to working with health authorities and other partners to prevent and treat the disease. In 2020 we launched a long-term social responsibility strategy, Defeat Diabetes, to help society rise to one of its biggest challenges. We recognise that we cannot defeat diabetes alone, but we can accelerate our actions to find solutions.InnovationOur key contribution is to discover and develop innovative biological medicines and make them accessible to patients throughout the world. In 2020, we reached an estimated total of 32.8 million patients with our Diabetes care products, up 9% from 2019.Read more in the section on innovation and therapeutic focus.Access and affordabilityWe recognise that affordability of medicines can be a challenge and we know that some people in the US living with diabetes are increasingly finding it hard to pay for their healthcare, including our diabetes medicines. Ensuring access and affordability is a responsibility we share with all involved in healthcare. During 2020, we continued our efforts to help patients in the US struggling to afford their Novo Nordisk insulins through a range of options, including:–  Follow-on brands: Unbranded biologic versions of fast-acting (Novolog®) and premix insulin (Novolog® Mix) at a 50% list price discount versus branded versions–  My$99Insulin: 30-day supply of a combination of Novo Nordisk insulin products (up to three vials or two packs of pens) for 99 USD for eligible patients–  Patient Assistance Program: Free diabetes medication to people in need who meet certain eligibility criteria, including annual household income at or below 400% of government-defined poverty level. Programme expanded during COVID-19–  Human insulin: For about 25 USD per vial at national pharmacies, including Walmart and CVS–  Immediate Supply Program: A free, one-time, immediate supply of Novo Nordisk insulin (up to 3 vials or 2 packs of pens) to eligible patients at risk of rationing–  Co-pay Savings Cards: To help defray high out-of-pocket costs for commercially insured patients.During 2020, we reached more than one million people through affordability offerings in the US.We also recognise that there are vulnerable patients in every country and to identify these groups we will initiate vulnerability assessments where we operate, excluding the US where we have already expanded our affordability offerings. We do this to identify how we can improve access to affordable care and capacity building. Based on 21 country assessments made in 2020, we have developed affordability plans in 19 countries.Vulnerable patient groups include people impact-ed by humanitarian crises, people living in remote areas or in poorer parts of the world with ineffi-cient healthcare systems and vulnerable popula-tion groups, such as children and the elderly.In 2020, we strengthened our Access to Insulin Commitment by lowering the ceiling price (the maximum price within the commitment) from USD 4 to USD 3 per human insulin vial in 76 countries. This covers Least Developed Countries as defined …accelerating prevention to bend the curve……providing access to affordable care for vulnerable patients in every country……innovating to improve lives.1. IDF Diabetes Atlas, 9th edition, 2019Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  14Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Purpose and sustainability  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fWe expanded our Changing  Diabetes in Children programmewith the ambition to reach100,000children by 2030.222clinics established.28,296 children reached in 14 countries. by the UN, other low-income countries as defined by the World Bank, and middle-income countries in which large low-income populations lack sufficient health coverage, as well as selected humanitarian organisations.An estimated 3.2 million people were treated with insulin under this commitment in 2020. In 2020, the average price of insulin sold under this commitment was 2.9 USD per vial, corresponding to 11.6 cents per patient per day. Beyond this commitment, we sold human insulin at or below the ceiling price in other countries, reaching an estimated another 3.1 million people during 2020. Our Access to Insulin Commitment is only one element and it cannot stand alone. Supply chain improvements and capacity building are also important in our efforts to provide access to affordable care to vulnerable patients. Read more about our Access to Insulin Commitment on novonordisk.com.To further improve capacity building we extended our Partnering for Change partnership with the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the Danish Red Cross (DRC), aimed at improving care for people living with chronic diseases in humanitarian crises and we launched an ambition that no child should die from type 1 diabetes. To achieve this, we expanded our Changing Diabetes in Children programme with the aim of reaching 100,000 children by 2030. In 2020, we enrolled 2,601 additional children. In total, 469 healthcare professionals have been trained, 222 clinics established and 28,296 children across 14 countries have received care as part of the programme since 2009.PreventionIn addition to the impact on patient lives, ­diabetes also constitutes one of the biggest societal chal-lenges. To help society rise to this challenge, we focus our efforts within diabetes and obesity pre-vention where our expertise has the biggest impact. Our aim is to find, pilot and scale effective interven-tions to prevent diabetes and obesity, starting with early interventions and health inequalities in cities. Within early interventions, our collaboration with UNICEF to prevent childhood overweight and obesity in Mexico and Colombia is progressing despite COVID-19, and global advocacy on childhood malnutrition continues. Within health inequality in cities, we have a public-private partnership, Cities Changing Diabetes, which aims to address diabetes prevention and treatment amongst vulnerable populations in urban settings. In 2020, Cities Changing Diabetes reached 36 cities, up from 25 in 2019, spanning five continents and more than a hundred local partners across the public and private sectors.Donations and other contributionsDuring 2020 we increased our donations, partly to respond to COVID-19. Selected donations include:– 165 DKK million to the Antimicrobial Resistance Research (AMR) Action Fund, the largest collective fund ever established to support vital research into antimicrobial resistance research and development1–  138 DKK million to the World Diabetes Foundation (WDF), including a special one-off contribution of 50 DKK million in 2020–  20 DKK million to the Novo Nordisk Haemophilia FoundationHelping society respond to COVID-19Since the outbreak of COVID-19, additional efforts have been focused on helping society.In Denmark, where we are headquartered, we supported the Danish healthcare system in increasing national testing capacity and developed a COVID-19 antibody test which is being used by the University of Copenhagen to study the virus.We offered free insulin for six months to the hu-manitarian organisations that we normally supply, including UNRWA and the Red Cross Organisa-tions, to support relief efforts in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries.EmployeesWe aim to be an attractive employer that offers an inclusive, diverse, safe and ethical working environment in which all employees have equal opportunities to realise their potential.At the end of 2020, the total number of people employed in Novo Nordisk was 45,323, 1.

The growth was mainly driven by International Operations. Diversity and inclusionTo deliver on our Strategic Aspirations it is crucial to have an inclusive and diverse organisation at all levels, including our Board of Directors. We fundamentally believe that diversity of people and inclusive leadership drive value for Novo Nordisk.One element of our diversity and inclusion aspiration is to achieve a balanced gender representation at all managerial levels. While several initiatives have been launched to accelerate diversity and inclusion and drive gender balance, there has only been gradual change and we still have room for improvement. The gender distribution amongst managers in 2020 was 59% men and 41% women, compared with 40% women in 2019. In Senior Management1 76% were men and 24% were women in 2020, compared with 18% women in 2019. In our Board of Directors 62% were men and 38% women. To accelerate diversity and inclusion and ensure accountability for driving progress, all levels throughout the organisation have implemented local action plans during 2020. In addition, in 2020 diversity and inclusion has been anchored in both short- and long-term incentive programmes. The strong stance on diversity and inclusion will continue in 2021 with a focus on realising continuous progress from the local action plans.Human rights and labour We are committed to fulfilling our responsibility to respect human rights, including labour rights across all our activities and business relationships as a minimum standard of business conduct. Read more about our Human Rights Commitment on novonordisk.com. Since 2014, we have been a part of the living wage programme with an external global non-profit business network and consultancy. The objective is to ensure that all our employees are paid a living wage, i.e. adequate to purchase basic goods and services necessary to achieve a basic standard of living, based on calculations of living wages in the countries we operate in. In 2020 we analysed data for 74 countries compared with 12 countries in 2019, and as a result of this analysis an action plan has been implemented.Read more about our Global Labour Code of Conduct for labour rights on novonordisk.com.Progress was made in regard to management of salient human rights issues beyond those already addressed by existing global standards and programmes. In 2020, manager and employee human rights training strengthened awareness of these issues, while the training scope covered all human rights and all company operations. In 2020, for patient safety and the right to health, we strove to increase the share of affiliates providing safety reporting on local websites to more than 96%. For availability and affordability aspects of the right to health, see progress above. To mitigate risks of exploitation of human biosamples used in pre-clinical research and ensure respect for donors’ rights to free and informed consent, we implemented a strengthened risk-based due diligence process. For local manufacturing projects, we implemented enhanced human rights due diligence requirements for all new high-risk business partners. For supply chains, we strengthened the human rights focus of our supplier audits, by updating the auditor toolbox and conducting training with an external expert organisation.

We strive to conduct our business in a responsible manner, in accordance with the Novo Nordisk Way – a set of guiding principles which underpins every decision we make.Novo Nordisk WayThe Novo Nordisk Way is a set of guiding principles which underpins every decision we make. We use a unique, systematic approach known as facilitation to ensure that everyone lives up to the Novo Nordisk Way. In 2020, 26 facilitations were conducted, down from 32 in 2019 due to COVID-19 travel restrictions. Any issues are addressed locally, and consolidated insights are shared with Executive Management and the Board of Directors. The Novo Nordisk Way also underpins our performance management and incentive programmes. The Novo Nordisk Way states that we treat everyone with respect, meaning there is no acceptance of discrimination nor harassment. We have processes in place to encourage the reporting of any discrimination, harassment or retaliation, including an anonymous reporting hotline. We encourage all managers and employees to have an open dialogue on the matter.Company trustThe level of trust in Novo Nordisk among key stakeholders – people with diabetes, general practitioners and diabetes specialists – is an indicator of the extent to which we are living up to stakeholders’ expectations. Our trust score, measured on a scale of 0-100, increased to 80.6 in 2020 from 78.2 in 2019. The increase was the most significant improvement in a trust score in the pharmaceutical industry in 2020.Business ethics Our approach to business ethics is about acting with integrity and in compliance with the Novo Nordisk Way, our Business Ethics Code of Conduct and international and local standards for responsible business conduct. Business ethics covers anti-bribery and anti-corruption, data protection and human rights with the aim of minimising any potential risks to our business, people and society. Annual training in business ethics is mandatory for all employees, including all new hires. In 2020, 99% of employees completed and documented their training, with the remaining 1% missing mainly due to employees being on leave. In 2020, 32 business ethics reviews were completed with 107 findings, compared with 34 reviews with 87 findings in 2019. Consolidated findings are reported to our Executive Management and the Audit Committee. During COVID-19, all audits outside Denmark were conducted virtually. Despite the changed approach for 2020, Group Internal Audit assesses that the level of business ethics compliance is sound. Management action plans and closure of findings progressed as planned, and there were no overdue management actions or findings at the end of the year. In 2020, we started developing data ethics principles and will implement these principles to ensure responsible and sustainable use of data. Furthermore, data protection and human rights risks were integrated into the global business ethics risk reporting process in 2020.Product quality and supplier auditsIn 2020, as in 2019, there were no failed inspec-tions among those resolved at year-end. During the year, 77 inspections were conducted, com-pared with 66 in 2019. At year-end, 59 inspections were passed and 18 were unresolved, as final inspection reports had not been received or the Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  17Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Purpose and sustainability  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fCorporate income taxes by region – three year average  Share of categoryRegionIntellectualproperty rights1Production2Sales3Corporate income taxes(DKK billion) International Operations 8.4– Denmark7.2– EMEA (excluding Denmark)0.9– China0.2– Rest of World0.1North America Operations1.5– Of which the US1.4Total9.9Roshni has type 1 diabetes  and lives in India1.

A follow-up audit has since been conducted, where the finding was found to have been closed satisfactorily.In 2020, we had no product recalls from the market, compared with four in 2019.Corporate governanceAs a foundation-owned company, being a sustainable business is integrated into our ownership structure. Our foundation ownership supports the overarching imperative to be both commercially successful and responsive to the wider needs of society. The fact that we have a combination of foundation ownerships and stock listing enables us to embark on long-term strategies while maintaining short-term transparency on performance.The objective of the Novo Nordisk Foundation is to provide a stable basis for the commercial and research activities of Novo Nordisk and support broader scientific, humanitarian and social purposes.In addition to managing our business, our governing bodies set direction and ensure that sustainability is implemented in business decisions. In line with that, two consistent priorities were high on the Board’s agenda in 2020, namely scientific innovation and sustainability – both of which are vital to the future of the company.Read more about our corporate governance in the corporate governance section of this report.Remuneration The variable remuneration of executives is designed to promote performance in line with the company’s strategy, purpose and ambition to be a sustainable business.Read more about the remuneration of our executives in the corporate governance section of this report.Sustainable tax approachOur overall guiding principle within tax is to have a sustainable tax approach (tax policy), emphasising our commercial approach to managing the impact of taxes while remaining true to our values of operating our business in a responsible and transparent manner. This means that we pay tax where value is generated and are always respecting international and domestic tax rules. As a global business, we conduct cross-border trading, which is subject to transfer pricing reg-ulations. We apply a 'Principal structure' in line with OECD principles, meaning all legal entities perform their functions on contract on behalf of the principals and are allocated an activity-based profit according to a benchmarked profit mar-gin. The tax outcome of this operational model is reflected in the overview below, which shows our corporate income taxes by region. To ensure alignment between taxing authorities about the allocation of profit between our entities, we have Advance Pricing Agreements in place for geogra-phies representing more than 65% of our revenue worldwide.Our sustainable tax approach has been approved by the Board of Directors. Read more about our sustainable tax approach on novonordisk.com.In addition to corporate income taxes, we also pay other taxes.

Here we take a stepwise approach to incorporate material climate-related disclosures into our annual report. A summary of how we address the risks related to climate change can be found at our website and in our CDP disclosure report. As recommended by TCFD, we are integrating climate change scenarios of 2⁰C, consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement Goal (Representative Concentration Pathway ‘RCP 2.6’) and 4⁰C as an alternative high emission (RCP 8.5) RCP to identify short-, medium- and long-term risks within our production and supply chain to ensure a steady supply of medicine to patients.We strive to adhere to the disclosures of the Social Accountability Standards Board (SASB) which apply to our industry. We do this to demonstrate our commitment to being transparent and accountable for how we operate. We are fully or partially aligned to 20 of 25 metrics. In 2021 we will further assess our adherence and disclosure.For the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), we focus our efforts on Goal 3, 'health' and Goal 12, 'responsible consumption and production', as this is where we believe we can maximise our positive impact on the SDGs.Read more about our sustainability governance in the consolidated ESG statement in this report and on novonordisk.com.Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  19Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Purpose and sustainability  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fInnovation and therapeutic focusPrioritising a pipeline of hope for serious chronic diseasesFor almost a century, Novo Nordisk has pioneered scientific breakthroughs within serious chronic diseases. To ensure that we continue to deliver value to society, we are pursuing even higher levels of innovation, across more therapy areas and technology platforms and with more patients and partners than at any point in our history.Discovering ways to treat serious chronic diseases has never been more important. The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the vulnerability of hundreds of millions of people with diabetes, obesity and other serious chronic diseases, underlining the urgency of addressing their unmet medical needs.We are rising to the challenge by building on a successful track record in diabetes to pursue innovative approaches to fighting obesity and other serious chronic diseases, as well as expanding our therapy area focus. These approaches will rely not only on our cutting-edge protein and peptide engineering, but on novel technology platforms including oral delivery of biologics, stem cells, RNA interference (RNAi) and gene editing to further advance our innovative pipeline for long-term success.Shifting gears for future growthOur Research & Development (R&D) strategy is driven by targeted investment in novel products and technology platforms, resulting in higher levels of innovation across more therapy areas and with more external partners than at any point in our near 100-year history. In an increasingly competitive biopharmaceutical industry, this gear-shift is imperative to ensure that we retain a leading scientific position in the disruptive innovations that are set to transform medicine in the 21st century.Over the past decade, on average we have developed one novel product each year and our business has grown strongly. To secure future growth platforms, we expect to increase our R&D investments in near- and mid-term opportunities. By building on our core capabilities including our clinical trial expertise, large scale protein manufacturing base and commercial excellence, we strive to enable more products to be launched in future years.In 2020 we had more than 43,500 patients partici-pating in our clinical phase one to four trials – more than at any point in our history. And, despite the disruption caused to society and healthcare sys-tems by COVID-19, we safely maintained continuity of key clinical trials through remote monitoring of patients and by distributing trial products directly to them rather than via study sites where possible.Significant regulatory milestones in the past year included European and Japanese approvals for Rybelsus® – the first commercially available GLP-1 based medicine in a tablet – strengthening our leadership position in diabetes. The once-daily treatment represents a major technological advance for people living with type 2 diabetes and is now available in nine markets.2025 Strategic Aspirations  Innovation and therapeutic focus –  \u0007Further raise the innovation bar for diabetes treatment–  \u0007Develop a leading portfolio of superior treatment solutions for obesity–  \u0007Strengthen and progress the Biopharm pipeline– \u0007Establish presence in other serious chronic diseases focusing on cardiovascular disease, NASH and chronic kidney diseaseAugust and Marie Krogh brought insulin, a breakthroughinnovation discovered 100 years ago, to Denmark, where NordiskInsulinlaboratorium subsequently commercialised the productionof insulin.Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  20Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Innovation and therapeutic focus  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fRaising the bar in diabetes researchWith the number of people living with diabetes projected to increase from 463 million today to 700 million in 20451, there remains an urgent need to find innovative and more convenient treatments. This includes novel forms of insulin, a molecule discovered 100 years ago in 1921. One such candidate is insulin icodec, which during 2020 was seen to be effective and well-tolerated in phase 2 trials. This once-weekly insulin might one day offer patients far fewer injections than the current option of once- or twice-daily basal insulins. Within GLP-1s we are building on our legacy by developing mono- and combination therapies that deliver higher efficacy and improved outcomes by demonstrating benefits on diabetes comorbidities. However, our efforts within diabetes research do not stop there. In late 2020, we initiated a phase 1 trial to establish the safety of a glucose-sensitive insulin candidate. We hope that such a treatment might one day mimic the body’s own, naturally oc-curring insulin by sensing and responding to blood sugar levels in the body. Furthermore, together with Massachusetts Institute of Technology, we are continuing to progress the development of sys-tems enabling the oral delivery of macromolecules, including the tortoise shell-inspired, self-orienting oral device 'SOMA', with the ultimate ambition of one day delivering insulin in a tablet.Shaping the future of obesity treatmentWe are also playing a leading role in discover-ing new treatments for obesity, which is still not universally recognised as a serious chronic and progressive disease. This is despite the fact that people with obesity face a range of other health risks, from cancer, type 2 diabetes and heart disease to severe illness or complications from COVID-19. Among significant progress made in the past year was the phase 3 clinical trial programme STEP (Semaglutide Treatment Effect in People with obesity), in which our GLP-1 once weekly injectable semaglutide 2.4 mg demonstrated average weight loss of 17%-18% over 68 weeks in subjects with obesity without diabetes, when using a trial prod-uct estimand (15%-17% weight loss reported when using a treatment policy estimand). By leveraging GLP-1 semaglutide treatment we hope to maxim-ise the ability of people with obesity to achieve and maintain substantial weight loss. Our aspiration is to close the gap between current pharmacological treatment options and bariatric surgery by using combination therapies based on our peptide innovation.Semaglutide – also the active ingredient in Ry-belsus® and Ozempic® – exemplifies an important trend in medicine in the form of a more holistic approach to cardiometabolic diseases. The close association between type 2 diabetes, obesity, cardiovascular disease, chronic kidney disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) means that the classical siloed approach to treating disease symptoms one by one is breaking down and that a molecule like semaglutide can potentially target a number of different therapeutic areas.Other serious chronic diseasesAs a result, semaglutide is becoming a pipeline of opportunities within a single molecule. In addition to the results seen with semaglutide in diabetes and obesity, a recent phase 2 trial involving patients with NASH showed that treatment with semaglutide resulted in a significantly higher percentage of patients achieving NASH resolution compared to placebo and could potentially play a key role in preventing disease progression. Furthermore, early-stage research supports investigating semaglutide as treatment for early Alzheimer's disease. A pivotal phase 3 programme with oral semaglutide will be initiated in the first half of 2021. But, while such a molecule is every scientist's dream, our long-term innovation for the benefit of patients must go beyond semaglutide.It is with this ambition that we are branching into areas of medicine that build upon our core capabilities. In cardiovascular therapy, this includes several approaches, including an anti-IL6 monoclonal antibody and a PCSK9 peptide-based inhibitor, the latter of which would provide an alternative to existing forms of powerful cholesterol-lowering therapy. This molecule has just completed phase 1 studies.1. IDF Diabetes Atlas, 9th edition, 2019Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  21Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Innovation and therapeutic focus  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fHarnessing external innovationThe acquisition in 2020 of US-based biotech company Corvidia Therapeutics further strengthens our pipeline by introducing the anti-IL-6 monoclonal antibody, ziltivekimab, which has shown encouraging results in phase 2 on inflammatory biomarkers in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and chronic kidney disease.Strategic investments of this nature reflect our ambition to establish a leading presence in new adjacent therapy areas – just as we do within diabetes, obesity, haemophilia and growth disorders. During 2020, we also acquired Emisphere Technologies, and with it proprietary technologies that enable the oral formulation of therapeutics – including the Eligen® SNAC technology found in Rybelsus®.By continuing to work with a growing number of external partners and investing in novel technology platforms – including stem cell research, RNA-interfering (RNAi) therapeutics and gene editing – we aim to deliver innovation across a broader range of serious chronic diseases than ever before. These technologies are revolutionising what is possible in medicine and they will power the disruptive innovations of the future.Progressing the Biopharm pipelineExternal innovation is also playing an important role in the evolution of our Biopharm business, a speciality care unit that encompasses treatments for rare blood and rare endocrine disorders, where unmet need remains high. Our pipeline includes Mim8 – a next generation treatment for haemophilia A, concizumab for the treatment of haemophilia A or B and once-weekly somapacitan for growth-related disorders. However, we are also collaborating with bluebird bio, which is pioneering the development of next-generation in vivo genome editing treatments for genetic diseases, including haemophilia.Looking to the futureOur investment in stem cell-based, regenerative therapies lays the foundation for additional expansion into new areas such as Parkinson’s disease, dry age-related macular degeneration and chronic heart failure. Not to mention stem cell-based therapies potentially offering a path to curing type 1 diabetes – an aspiration at the heart of our purpose to defeat diabetes and other serious chronic diseases.One thing common to our entire innovation strategy is a drive to maximise the potential of data and digital technology – spaces that we invested in throughout 2020 via recruitment and external collaboration. It is increasingly clear that excellence in digital science, just as much as expertise in biology, will be vital for success in biopharmaceutical R&D in the 21st century, as advances in analytics and real-world evidence move data-driven discovery to centre-stage in the hunt for new medicines.Shirley Stewart has type 2 diabetes and lives in the US\u0007Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  22Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Innovation and therapeutic focus  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fInnovation and therapeutic focusResearch and developmentDiabetesRegulatory events–\t The oral glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1) analogue in a tablet, Rybelsus®, was granted market authorisation in the EU and Japan for treatment of adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D).–\t In China, a label expansion for Victoza® was approved to include a cardiovascular (CV) indication based on LEADER.

But ensuring that life-saving medicines reach all those who require them – from Stockholm to Shanghai and New York to Nigeria – has demanded new ways of doing business in 2020 as the COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted societies and economies.Despite the challenging backdrop provided by the COVID-19 pandemic, our commercial teams around the world have remained committed to delivering innovation to patients. By harnessing the power of digital technologies, they have shown it is possible to continue to grow market share and execute on key new product launches, while meeting the needs of our patients and customers. This includes the successful roll-out of Rybelsus®, our GLP-1 based medicine in a tablet. As a result, we remain on track to reach our goal of a global diabetes value market share of more than one third by 2025, after expanding our value market share by 0.7 percentage points to 29.3% in 2020. Obesity treatment sales were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 but are also on course to double from 2019 to 2025, while the Biopharm division is building a platform for sustainable growth.A victory for agilityOur ability to maintain effective commercial operations during these exceptional times reflects our willingness to pursue new, simpler, agile ways of working. Even before the pandemic hit, we were already adopting strategies to address the opportunity presented by the rise of digitisation in healthcare and the challenge of ensuring the affordability of our medicines. The effect of COVID-19 has been to push the 'fast-forward' button on all these key activities, inspiring colleagues to adapt and evolve business practices faster than ever in 2020.The crisis underscores the importance of increasing our efforts in prevention and disease management for people with diabetes and obesity, as they are subject to an increased risk of severe symptoms and outcomes from COVID-19. With millions of patients depending on us, failing to meet their needs is simply not an option.Embracing virtual interactionsAcross the pharmaceutical industry the pandemic has created an unprecedented commercial environment in which traditional ways of delivering medical innovations could no longer continue. Face-to-face contacts – whether between patients and doctors or companies and customers – became almost impossible in many countries for significant periods of 2020. This challenged some parts of our business, especially in the dynamic section of the market as fewer patients could be initiated onto new treatments in the face of widespread lockdowns and follow-up clinic visits were delayed.But we quickly adapted to the new ways of communicating, by transitioning to virtual interactions with healthcare professionals and customers. As well as a far greater degree of virtual interactions, this involved making the majority of our commercial materials digital and shifting group presentations into a virtual setting – a particularly popular approach in China. We also moved our line-up of expert educational events to digital platforms, running a significant proportion of these virtually in 2020.Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  26Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Commercial execution  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fSource: IQVIA dataThis line-up of changes dovetailed with a dramatic rise in the use of telemedicine across primary and some secondary care in key markets including the US and the UK, as well as the transition of international medical congresses from physical to virtual platforms. Fortunately, the inability to run physical congresses allowed many more healthcare professionals who would not normally attend in person to participate remotely and learn about the latest developments in their field.A leading portfolio of diabetes medicines In diabetes, 2020 was a breakthrough year for our latest GLP-1 products, with Ozempic®, our once weekly injectable, now launched in 52 countries around the world and Rybelsus®, our semaglutide-based oral medicine, now launched in nine countries around the world. Overall sales of GLP-1 products for type 2 diabetes (Victoza®, Ozempic® and Rybelsus®) increased by 25.9% in Danish kroner and by 28.7% in constant exchange rates.GLP-1 therapies are now helping millions of people to manage their disease, and the segment’s value share of the total diabetes market has grown to 50.4% compared with 47.5% a year ago. The GLP-1 story shows how we are continuing to deliver meaningful advances for patients, despite having been in diabetes for nearly a century.Insulin sales across global markets were mixed, with growth across International Operations being offset by declining sales in the US due to lower realised prices following higher rebates, launches of affordability programmes and changes in the Medicare Part D Coverage Gap legislation. Measured by volume, we continue to be the world’s leading provider of insulin.Around the globe, the insulin market is becoming increasingly competitive, and we are adapting our commercial approach according to the needs of different markets. Despite the challenges, one of our core strengths is a broad portfolio of products at different price points – from human insulin in Ozempic® has now been launched in52countries Rybelsus® in9 countriesDiabetes value market share (%)  GLP-1      Insulin      Diabetes%2018202535304045502019202046.2%47.5%43.6%44.5%27.8%28.6%29.3%44.3%50.4%glass vials to the newer insulins, such as Tresiba® and Ryzodeg®, offered in FlexTouch® pre-filled pens. We are also adapting packaging to the needs of different markets, for example by offering smaller pack sizes in out-of-pocket markets such as in India, where some customers struggle to afford monthly or quarterly purchases of their medicines.We also know some people are struggling to afford their insulin in the US as well, and offer patients a range of options to help. We invested in raising awareness of Novocare®, which provides patient affordability and access support, to ensure Leonardo is living with type 1 diabetes in Mexico,studying in high school and doing triathlons.Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  27Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Commercial execution  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fthat during a period of financial hardship and increased unemployment, patients are aware of the options available – including our Patient Assistance Program, which offered a free 90-day supply of insulin for eligible patients who lost healthcare coverage due to COVID-19.Leading the way in obesityObesity is a serious chronic disease that is closely linked to type 2 diabetes and which also poses a range of other health risks – from cancer and heart disease to severe outcomes from COVID-19. Our ambition is to ensure that it is widely recognised as such and to offer medical treatment to help effective management of the disease. It has been encouraging to see more governments – including Italy, Germany, the UK and Switzerland – taking steps during 2020 to recognise and address obesity as a chronic disease. But there is still more to be done to raise awareness and to fight the stigma and bias associated with obesity.Sales of Saxenda® increased by 3.3% in constant exchange rates, while declining by 1.3% in Danish kroner in 2020. Sales growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19 as fewer patients initiated treatment. In October 2020 the United Kingdom’s National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) recommended Saxenda® for certain people with obesity3; however, it is often not reimbursed and is paid for out of pocket by patients. In countries such as Brazil, Saudi Arabia and South Korea, fewer Saxenda® prescriptions were filled due to patients cutting personal spending as the COVID-19 pandemic took hold. In the US, meanwhile, growth was negatively impacted by a significant drop in doctor visits and fewer patients initiating treatment.Nonetheless, we remain confident in the difference we can make for people with obesity and we are well-placed to serve a growing demand as we aspire to transition from a single-product obesity offering to a portfolio of therapies in the future. In the near term, this is expected to be driven by semaglutide, 2.4 mg, which has proven effective in clinical trials, demonstrating weight loss of 17%-18% in subject with obesity without diabetes, when using a trial product estimand (15%-17% weight loss reported when using a treatment policy estimand), and thus showing potential as a transformative treatment for obesity.Building in BiopharmSales of Biopharm products increased by 0.7% in constant exchange rates and declined 1.3% in Danish kroner. The growth as measured in constant exchange rates is following increasing demand for our growth hormone Norditropin®, due in part to supply challenges for competing products in some countries. Our haemophilia medicine NovoSeven®, however, experienced weaker sales, partly as a result of reduced elective surgeries and bleeds during COVID-19 lockdowns. This was offset to some extent by the successful roll-out of the new haemophilia treatments Esperoct® and Refixia®.The global burden of obesity 650million adults have obesity1124million children and adolescents  are living with obesity2Obesity sales   Sales as reported     Growth at CERBiopharm sales   Sales as reported     Growth at CERBjarne Lynderup is living with obesity in Denmark1.

Diabetes and Obesity care Diabetes care, sales development Sales in Diabetes care increased by 5% measured in Danish kroner and by 8% at CER to DKK 102,412 million driven by GLP-1 growth. Novo Nordisk has improved the global diabetes value market share over the last 12 months from 28.6% to 29.3%, driven by market share gains in both International Operations and North America Operations. In the following sections, unless otherwise noted, market data are based on moving annual total (MAT) from November 2020 and November 2019 provided by the independent data provider IQVIA. InsulinSales of insulin decreased by 5% measured in Danish kroner and by 3% at CER to DKK 56,550 million. The sales decrease was driven by declining sales in the US, partly offset by increased sales in International Operations. Sales of long-acting insulin decreased by 11% measured in Danish kroner and by 9% at CER to DKK 18,439 million. Novo Nordisk has increased its global volume market share in the long-acting insulin segment from 32.4% to 32.8% in the last 12 months. The sales decline measured at CER was driven by declining Levemir® and Tresiba® sales, partially offset by increased sales of Xultophy®. Tresiba® has been launched in 91 countries, while Xultophy® has been launched in 42 countries. Sales of premix insulin increased by 3% measured in Danish kroner and by 6% at CER to DKK 10,925 million.

Novo Nordisk continues to be the global market leader in the GLP-1 segment with a 50.4% value market share, an increase of 2.9 percentage points compared to 12 months ago. Sales growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19.  Obesity care, sales developmentSales of Saxenda® decreased by 1% measured in Danish kroner and increased by 3% at CER to DKK 5,608 million. Saxenda® sales growth at CER was driven by International Operations, partially offset by North America Operations. Sales growth was negatively impacted by COVID-19 as fewer patients initiated treatment. Saxenda® has now been launched in 55 countries. Novo Nordisk currently has a value market share of 64.7% of the global obesity prescription drug market. BiopharmBiopharm, sales developmentSales of biopharm products decreased by 1% measured in Danish kroner and increased by 1% at CER to DKK 18,926 million. The sales growth at CER was driven by International Operations. Sales growth was driven by Growth Disorders and the launches of new haemophilia products, offset by declining sales of NovoSeven®. Sales growth was negatively impacted by lower demand due to COVID-19.HaemophiliaSales of haemophilia products decreased by 6% measured in Danish kroner and by 4% at CER to DKK 9,662 million. The decreasing sales were driven by declining NovoSeven® sales, while the haemophilia A and B franchises grew driven by the continued global roll-out of Esperoct® and Refixia®.Sales of NovoSeven® decreased by 11% measured in Danish kroner and by 9% at CER to DKK 7,203 million. The sales development was driven by declining sales in North America Operations, Rest of World and EMEA, partially offset by increasing sales in Region China, reflecting timing of ship-ments. The declining sales partly reflect reduced elective surgeries and bleedings due to COVID-19. Sales of NovoEight® decreased by 4% measured in Danish kroner and by 1% at CER to DKK 1,462 million. The decreasing sales were driven by declining sales in EMEA and the US, partly offset by increased sales in Rest of World. The NovoEight® sales decrease was offset by Esperoct®, the long-acting haemophilia A treatment, which has now been launched in 19 countries. Sales of Refixia® increased to DKK 518 million. Sales growth was driven by continued uptake in Rest of World and EMEA as well as continued uptake in North America Operations. Refixia® has been launched in 25 countries. Growth disorders (Norditropin®) Sales of Norditropin® increased by 6% measured in Danish kroner and by 8% at CER to DKK 7,704 million.

The unchanged gross margin reflects productivity improvements and a positive product mix driven by increased GLP-1 sales. This is countered by a negative impact from lower realised prices in the US and a negative currency impact of 0.3 percentage points.Sales and distribution costs increased by 3% measured in Danish kroner and by 6% at CER to DKK 32,928 million. The increase in costs is driven by North America Operations reflecting launch activities for Rybelsus® and continued promotional activities for Ozempic®, partly offset by lower promotional spend related to insulin. In International Operations, promotional spend is related to launch activities for Ozempic® and Rybelsus® as well as the continued roll-out of Saxenda®. COVID-19 resulted in a reduction of the activity level and delay of promotional activities. Research and development costs increased by 9% measured in Danish kroner and by 10% at CER to DKK 15,462 million. The cost increase is driven by the amortisation of the priority review voucher for semaglutide 2.4 mg in obesity in the third quarter of 2020. Increased activities within Other serious chronic diseases are driving the cost increase following progression of the early pipeline within cardiovascular disease and stem cell projects as well as patient recruitment to the ongoing cardiovascular outcomes trials, SOUL and SELECT.Administration costs decreased by 1% measured in Danish kroner and increased by 1% at CER to DKK 3,958 million, reflecting broadly unchanged spend across administrative areas. Other operating income (net) was DKK 460 million compared with DKK 600 million in 2019 following reduced royalty income. Operating profit increased by 3% measured in Danish kroner and by 7% at CER to DKK 54,126 million. Financial items (net) and taxFinancial items (net) showed a net loss of DKK 996 million compared with a net loss of DKK 3,930 million in 2019. In line with Novo Nordisk’s treasury policy, the most significant foreign exchange risks for Novo Nordisk have been hedged, primarily through foreign exchange forward contracts. The foreign exchange result was a net loss of DKK 747 million compared with a net loss of DKK 3,212 million in 2019. This reflects losses on non-hedged currencies driven by significant depreciations of several emerging market currencies, partially offset by gains on hedged currencies.As per the end of December 2020, a positive market value of financial contracts of approximately DKK 1.8 billion has been deferred for recognition in 2021. For more information see note 4.3 in the financial statement. The effective tax rate is 20.7% in 2020 compared with an effective tax rate of 19.8% in 2019. In 2019, a tax reform was passed in Switzerland which had positive impact on the effective tax rate, driven by a non-recurring increase to deferred tax assets.Cash flow and capital allocationCapital expenditure for property, plant and equipment was DKK 5.8 billion compared with DKK 8.9 billion in 2019. The lower capital expenditure was mainly related to lower investments in the new production facility for diabetes active pharmaceutical ingredients in Clayton, North Carolina, US, which is now in the final stages of construction. Free cash flow of DKK 28.6 billion compared with DKK 34.5 billion in 2019. The decrease is reflecting purchase of intangible assets of DKK 16.3 billion, primarily related to the acquisitions of Corvidia Therapeutics Inc. and Emisphere Technologies Inc.Novo Nordisk’s financial reserves were DKK 28.8 billion by end of December 2020  comprising cash at bank and undrawn credit facilities less overdrafts and loans repayable within 12 months.

The guidance reflects expectations for continued sales growth in International Operations in line with the Strategic Aspiration of 6-10% growth as well as growth in North America Operations. The guidance reflects expectations for sales growth within Diabetes care, mainly driven by the GLP-1 products Ozempic® and Rybelsus®, as well as growth within Obesity care. Intensifying competition within both Diabetes care and Biopharm is also reflected in the guidance. Furthermore, continued pricing pressure within Diabetes care, especially in the US, is expected to negatively impact sales development. Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is expected to be around 4 percentage points lower than at CER. Operating profit growth is expected to be 4% to 8% at CER. The expectation for operating profit growth primarily reflects the sales growth out-look and continued investments in current and future growth drivers across the operating units, including the continued roll-out of Ozempic® and Rybelsus® as well as global investments in building an anti-obesity market and the expected launch of semaglutide 2.4 mg in the US. Furthermore, re-sources are allocated to both early and late-stage pipeline activities, including expected initiations of several phase 3a clinical trial programmes in 2021. Given the current exchange rates versus the Danish krone, growth reported in DKK is now expected to be around 6 percentage points lower than at CER, mainly driven by the spot rate of the USD being 615 versus an average of 654 in 2020. The current COVID-19 pandemic causes uncertainty to the outlook regarding the number of patients initiating treatment and societal impacts such as the unemployment rate in the US, which is impacting healthcare insurance coverage. The outlook is based on a number of assumptions related to the severity and duration of impacts from COVID-19. Consequently, volatility in quarterly results should be expected. For 2021, Novo Nordisk expects financial items (net) to amount to a gain of around DKK 0.7 billion, reflecting the expected hedging gains of DKK 1.1 billion mainly related to the US dollar with a hedging period of 11 months and associated hedging costs.The effective tax rate for 2021 is expected to be in the range of 20-22%. Capital expenditure is expected to be around DKK 8.0 billion in 2021, primarily relating to investments in additional capacity for active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) production at existing manufacturing sites within Diabetes care. The expected increase in capital expenditure reflects progress of R&D projects based on the oral technology platform. Depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses are expected to be around DKK 6.0 billion. The increase in depreciation, amortisation and impairment losses in 2021 reflects depreciation of the new production facility for diabetes active pharmaceutical ingredients in Clayton, North Carolina, US. The free cash flow is expected to be DKK 36-41 billion. The increase in free cash flow compared to 2020 reflects the impact from the acquisitions in 2020. All of the above expectations are based on as-sumptions that the global or regional macroeco-nomic and political environment will not significant-ly change business conditions for Novo Nordisk during 2021, including the potential implications from major healthcare reforms, and that the cur-rency exchange rates, especially the US dollar, will Outlook 2021The current expectations for 2021 are summarised in the table below:Expectations are as reported, if not otherwise statedExpectations 3 February 2021Sales growthat CER5% to 9%as reportedAround 4 percentage points lower than at CEROperating profit growthat CER4% to 8%as reportedAround 6 percentage points lower than at CERFinancial items (net)Gain of around DKK 0.7 billionEffective tax rate20% to 22%Capital expenditure (PP&E)Around DKK 8.0 billionDepreciation, amortisation and impairment lossesAround DKK 6 billionFree cash flowDKK 36-41 billionNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  32Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations — Financials  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fremain at the current level versus the Danish kro-ne.

Managing risks rigorously and systematically is key in order for us to create and protect value over the short, medium and long term. Addressing risks in our strategic planning: Scenario and risk-thinking exercises are part of our strategic planning process. They include analyses of market dynamics as well as socioeconomic and political developments that present risks or opportunities for our business.Access and affordability In the short and medium term, access to affordable care and innovative treatments is a key challenge for patients in many parts of the world. Access to affordable care is a global issue as healthcare systems struggle to provide quality care at a sustainable cost, while the burden of chronic diseases keeps rising. Ensuring access and affordability is a responsibility Novo Nordisk shares with all involved in healthcare. We recognise that we cannot defeat diabetes alone, but we can accelerate our actions to find solutions in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.Digital disruptionNew digital technologies in healthcare are offering more personalised treatment and better manage-ment of diseases. This is an opportunity for us to deliver more value to our stakeholders and help patients live a life free from the limitations of their disease. New digital health solutions, including our own, bring new risks particularly around data regu-lation and data privacy, as well as potential quality and reliability risks. We strive to develop digital health solutions in collaboration with relevant part-ners. We also believe in the value of open innova-tion and sharing our knowledge and experience. Environmental risksWe are preparing for the risks and opportunities which will arise from climate change. As recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), we are integrating climate change scenarios into our risk management processes to identify short-, medium- and long-term risks.Human rights and labour risks We take a proactive approach to integrating risk management of human and labour rights into our risk management process, while recognising that modern slavery, including human trafficking, forced labour, bonded labour, child slavery and hazardous child labour, can occur in every industry and sector. We respect human rights as per the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. Risk management processA rigorous approach to enterprise risk management helps the company protect and enhance the value of our assets. We are continually exposed to risks throughout our value chain – from early discovery of new, promising molecules to the production and delivery of medicines to patients. Some risks are inherent in the pharmaceutical industry, such as delays or failures of potential new medicines in the R&D pipeline. Other risks, such as supply disrup-tions and competitive threats, are well-known to any manufacturing company with global produc-tion. We will never compromise on product quality, patient safety and business ethics: these are front and centre of our enterprise-wide risk management set-up. We apply a two-way lens and assess risks to potential financial loss and reputational damage.Executive Management and the Board of Directors review a 'heat map' of our biggest risks every six months. This map is based on insights from man-agement teams in the organisation and includes risks that could cause significant disruptions to the business over a three-year horizon.

The A and B shares are calculated in units of DKK 0.20, amount-ing to 2.35 billion shares. The A share capital, consisting of 537 million shares, has a nominal value of DKK 107,487,200 and the B share capital, consisting of 1,813 million shares, has a nominal value of DKK 362,512,800. Each A share carries 200 votes and each B share carries 20 votes. Novo Nordisk's B shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenha-gen and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as American Depository Receipts (ADRs).The company’s A shares are not listed and are held by Novo Holdings A/S1, a Danish public limited liability company wholly-owned by the Novo Nordisk Foundation. The Foundation has a dual objective: to provide a stable basis for the commercial and research activities conducted by the companies within the Novo Group (of which Novo Nordisk A/S is the largest), and to support scientific and humanitarian purposes. According to the Articles of Association of the Foundation, the A shares cannot be divested. Special rights attached to A shares include pre-emptive subscription rights in the event of an increase in the A share capital and pre-emptive purchase rights in the event of a sale of A shares, while B shares take priority for liquidation proceedings. A shares take priority for dividends below 0.5%, and B shares take priority for dividends between 0.5 and 5%. However, in practice, A and B shares receive the same amount of dividend per share.As of 31 December 2020, Novo Holdings A/S also held a B share capital of nominally DKK 24,347,800. Together with the A shares, Novo Holdings A/S's total ownership amounted to nominally DKK 131,835,000. Novo Holdings A/S's ownership is reflected in the 'Ownership structure' chart.There is no complete record of all shareholders; however, based on available sources of informa-tion, as of 31 December 2020 it is estimated that shares were geographically distributed as shown in the 'Geographical split of shareholders’ chart.

As of 31 December 2020, Novo Holdings A/S and Novo Nordisk B shares equalled 159,277,660 shares and had a nominal value of DKK 31,855,532. For details about the share capital, see note 4.1 to the consolidated financial statements.Capital structureNovo Nordisk’s Board of Directors and Executive Management consider that the current capital and share structure of Novo Nordisk serve the interests of the shareholders and the company well.

Dividend policyThe company’s dividend policy applies a pharmaceutical industry benchmark to ensure a competitive payout ratio for dividend payments, which are complemented by share repurchase programmes. The final dividend for 2019 paid in March 2020 was equal to DKK 5.35 per A and B share of DKK 0.20 as well as for ADRs. The total dividend for 2019 was DKK 8.35 per A and B share of DKK 0.20, corresponding to a payout ratio of 50.5%, which was in line with the 2019 pharma peer group average of 53.5%. In August 2020, an interim dividend was paid equalling DKK 3.25 per A and B share of DKK 0.20 as well as for ADRs. For 2020, the Board of Directors will propose a final dividend of DKK 5.85 to be paid in March 2021, equivalent to a total dividend for 2020 of DKK 9.10 and a payout ratio of 50.0%. The company expects to distribute an interim dividend in August 2021. Further information regarding this interim dividend will be announced in connection with the financial report for the first six months of 2021. Dividends are paid from distributable reserves. Novo Nordisk does not pay a dividend on its holding of treasury shares.Share repurchase programme for 2020/2021 During the twelve-month period beginning 1 February 2020, Novo Nordisk repurchased shares worth DKK 17 billion. The share repurchase pro-gramme has primarily been conducted in accord-ance with the safe harbour rules in the EU Market Abuse Regulation (MAR). For the next 12 months, Novo Nordisk has decided to implement a new share repurchase programme. The expected total repurchase value of B shares amounts to a cash value of up to DKK 17 billion. The total programme may be reduced in size if significant business de-velopment opportunities arise during 2021. Novo Nordisk expects to conduct the majority of the new share repurchase programme according to the safe harbour rules in MAR. At the Annual General Meeting in March 2021, the Board of Directors will propose a further reduction in the company’s B share capital, corresponding to approximate-ly 1.7% of the total share capital, by cancelling 40,000,000 treasury shares.Share price developmentNovo Nordisk’s share price increased by 10.3% between its 2019 close of DKK 386.65 and the 31 December 2020 close of DKK 426.65. For compar-ison purposes, the Danish OMXC25 stock index increased by 33.7% and the pharma peer group decreased by 2.4% during 2020. The total market value of Novo Nordisk’s B shares, excluding treas-ury shares and Novo Holdings A/S shares, was DKK 705,374,617,388 as of 31 December 2020.10.3%33.7%-2.4%200300400500600JanFebMarAprMayJuneJulyAugSepOctNovDecNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  37Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fCorporate governance ShareholdersKey responsibilitiesThe shareholders of Novo Nordisk have ultimate authority over the company and exercise their right to make decisions at general meetings. At the Annual General Meeting, shareholders approve the annual report and any amendments to the company’s Articles of Association. Shareholders also elect Board members and the independent auditor. Resolutions can generally be passed by a simple majority. However, resolutions to amend the Articles of Association require two thirds of the votes cast and capital represented, unless other adoption requirements are imposed by the Danish Companies Act.Novo Holdings A/S holds the majority of votes at general meetings. However, all strategic and operational matters are decided solely by the Board of Directors and Executive Management.

Nine were elected by shareholders and four by Danish-based employees. Board members must retire at the first Annual General Meeting after they reach the age of 70.Shareholder-elected Board members serve for a one-year term and may be re-elected, which was the case for all nine members at the Annual General Meeting in 2020. Two shareholder-elected Board members are not independent, as they are related to the main shareholder, Novo Holdings A/S, and may be regarded as representing Novo Holdings A/S’s 1 interests, while the remaining seven members are independent. For independence2, see table on page 44.Danish-based employees may elect a number of Board members equalling half of the shareholder-elected members. Employee-elected members serve for a statutory four-year term, with the next election in 2022, and have the same rights, duties and responsibilities as shareholder-elected members.Executive ManagementKey responsibilitiesExecutive Management is responsible for overall day-to-day management, the organisation of the company, allocation of resources, determination and implementation of strategies and policies, direction setting, and ensuring timely reporting and provision of information to the Board of Directors and Novo Nordisk’s stakeholders. To ensure the organisational implementation of our strategy, Executive Management has established a Management Board consisting of the Chief Executive Officer, Executive Vice Presidents and Senior Vice Presidents.Composition and meetingsAs of 31 December 2020, Executive Management consisted of nine members including the Chief Executive Officer. No changes were made in the composition of Executive Management in 2020. Executive Management meets at least once a month and due to COVID-19 a significant number of their meetings and other activities were conducted virtually.

The Audit Committee also discussed key accounting matters, including provisions for sales rebates, indirect production costs, ongoing tax and legal cases and impairment. The Audit Committee also reviewed Information Security, Business Ethics Compliance and Compliance Hotline cases. Finally, the Audit Committee recommended Deloitte to be elected as external auditor in 2021.In 2020, the Nomination Committee focused particularly on reviewing the composition of the Board, identifying and interviewing candidates and considering long-term succession planning. It also reviewed the desired competences to be represented on the Board.In 2020, the Remuneration Committee focused particularly on executive remuneration in light of the COVID-19 pandemic, on assessing the design and structure of the short-term as well as the long-term incentive programme for the Executive Management in 2021 and on enhancing the transparency in remuneration reporting even further.In 2020, the Research & Development Committee focused particularly on reviewing the results of clinical trials and discussed potential additional research and development activities to further explore opportunities within subcutaneous and oral GLP-1 as well as competitor initiatives. In addition, the committee discussed the potential opportunities for addressing unmet needs in mild cognitive impairment and mild dementia. It also reviewed potential external research collaborations as well as acquisitions.1.

When recommending candidates to be nominated by the Board, the Nomination Committee considers factors such as the balance between renewal and continuity, the desired competences and experience, the performance of the individual Board members, the ambition for diversity as well as independence considerations.The Board of Directors has determined a competence profile for the shareholder-elected Board members. Board members should possess integrity, accountability, fairness, financial literacy, commitment and desire for innovation. Additionally, the following competences and experience should be represented: Global business management, strategic operations and governance. Healthcare industry and market access. Research and development, technology and digitalisation. M&A and external innovation sourcing. People leadership and change management. Finance and accounting.Please refer to the overview on page 44 for com-petence profiles for shareholder-elected Board members. The Competence Profile is available at novonordisk.com.Board diversityIn 2016, the Board of Directors adjusted its diversity ambition and set new targets for diversity among shareholder-elected Board members. By 2020, it was the aim that at least two members were of Nordic nationality and two of non-Nordic nationality. The aim was also to have at least three shareholder-elected Board members of each gender.As of 31 December 2020, our shareholder-elected Board members consisted of two Nordic members and seven non-Nordic members. Of these, three members were female and six were male. Thus, the Board of Directors fulfilled its 2016 gender and nationality ambition. The Board of Directors finds that being diverse in gender and nationality is of continued importance, and consequently in 2020 the Board of Directors prolonged its gender and nationality ambition to 2024. When including the employee-elected Board members, six members were Nordic and seven were non-Nordic. Of these, five were female and eight were male.In accordance with sections 99b and 107d of the Danish Financial Statements Act, Novo Nordisk discloses current performance on diversity in the social responsibility section. Novo Nordisk’s diversity policy is available in that section.EvaluationThe Board conducts an annual evaluation. The evaluation includes all Board members and executives. The chair has overall responsibility for the evaluation in collaboration with the Nomination Committee. Every third year, the evaluation is facilitated by external consultants, who interview all Board members and executives. For the subsequent two years, the evaluation is facilitated by the secretary of the Nomination Committee based on written questionnaires. The evaluation includes topics such as Board performance, effectiveness, composition and succession, performance of the Chairmanship and the Board Committees as well as the collaboration in the Board and between the Board and Executive Management. Each Board member and executive also receives feedback from all other Board members and executives on their individual performance.In 2020, the Board evaluation was facilitated externally by a consultant working exclusively with Board effectiveness reviews. Overall, the evaluation revealed good performance by the Board and good collaboration between the Board and Executive Management. The evaluation resulted in continued focus on Board culture, evolving the induction for new Board members, Board documentation and presentations, Board competency profile and informal time between the Board members, which had been affected by COVID-19.Governance practicesNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  40Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fRemuneration In 2020, a new Remuneration Policy was adopted by the Annual General Meeting describing Board and Executive remuneration. The policy replaces Novo Nordisk’s Remuneration Principles and was introduced to comply with changed EU leg-islation. The new policy is applicable to Board remuneration as of 2020, while it is applicable to Executive remuneration as of 2021. Consequently, the Remuneration Principles applied to Board remuneration relating to the period up to and including 2019 and to Executive remuneration for the period up to and including 2020. The Remuneration Policy and the Remuneration Principles are available at: ­ https://www.novonordisk.com/about/ corporate-governance/remuneration.htmlNovo Nordisk has prepared a separate Remuneration Report describing the remuner-ation awarded or due during 2020 to the Board members and Executives as registered with the Danish Business Authority. The Remuneration Report will be submitted to the Annual General Meeting for an advisory vote. The Remuneration Report is available at: ­ https://www.novonordisk.com/about/ corporate-governance/remuneration.htmlDanish Corporate  Governance Recommendations not being fulfilled3.3.2Disclosure of additional information about the Board members: Information on matters such as numbers of shares owned and changes during the year is disclosed in the Remuneration Report for 2020 and not in the management commentary. 3.4.2 \u0007Independence of Board committees: The majority of the members of the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee are not independent. 3.4.6 \u0007Tasks of the Nomination Committee: Responsibility for succession manage-ment and recommending candidates for the Executive Management resides with the Chairmanship and not with the Nomination Committee. 3.4.7 \u0007Tasks of the Remuneration Committee: Responsibility for the remuneration pol-icy applicable to employees in general resides with Executive Management and not with the Remuneration Committee. 4.1.5 \u0007Termination payments: One executive employment contract entered into before 2008 allows for severance payments of more than 24 months’ fixed base salary plus pension contribution, and thus the total value of the remuneration relating to the notice period and of the severance payment exceeds two years of remuneration.Compliance with corporate governance codes Novo Nordisk’s B shares are listed on Nasdaq Copenhagen and on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) as American Dipository Receipts (ADRs).Today, Novo Nordisk adheres to all Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations (2017) designated by Nasdaq Copenhagen except the five recommendations outlined under the heading 'Danish Corporate Governance Recommendations not being fulfilled'.In addition, Novo Nordisk complies with the Corporate Governance Standards of the NYSE applicable to foreign private issuers. A summary of the significant ways in which Novo Nordisk’s corporate governance practices differ from the NYSE Corporate Governance Standards can be found in Novo Nordisk’s Corporate Governance Report 2020.Novo Nordisk's compliance with and explanations about the applicable corporate governance codes designated by Nasdaq Copenhagen and the New York Stock Exchange is available at  www.novonordisk.com/about/ corporate-governance/recommendations-and -practices.html in accordance with section 107b of the Danish Financial Statements Act. Disclosure regarding change of control The EU Takeover Bids Directive, as partially imple-mented by the Danish Financial Statements Act, requires listed companies to disclose information that may be of interest to the market and poten-tial take-over bidders, in particular in relation to disclosure of change-of-control provisions in material contracts. Novo Nordisk discloses that the Group has one significant agreement with a US payer which takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of control of the Group. If effected, a takeover could – at the discretion of the relevant counter-party – lead to the termination of such agree-ment. Given the ownership structure of Novo Nordisk, the risk is considered to be remote.In relation to Executive Management,the current employment contracts allowfor severance payments of up to 36 months' fixed base salary plus pension contributions in the event of a merger, acquisition or takeover of Novo Nordisk.For information about the ownership structure of Novo Nordisk, see 'Shares and capital structure'.Novo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  41Introducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional information\fBoard of DirectorsHelge Lund — ChairChair of the Board of Novo Nordisk A/S since 2018 (member for one year in 2014-2015 and again in 2017) and chair of the Nomination Committee since 2018 (member since 2017).

write-down3.3LowProvisions and contingent liabilitiesEstimate of ongoing legal disputes, litigation and investigations3.6MediumKey accounting estimates and judgementsThe use of reasonable estimates and judgements is an essential part of the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Given the uncertainties inherent in Novo Nordisk’s business activities, Management must make certain estimates regarding valuation and make judgements on the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, net sales, expenses and related disclosures.The key accounting estimates identified are those that have a significant risk of resulting in a material adjustment to the measurement of assets and liabilities in the following reporting period. An example being the estimation of US sales deductions and provisions for sales rebates. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are held to be reasonable under the circumstances. The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. If necessary, changes are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised. Management considers the key accounting estimates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. The actual amounts may differ from the amounts estimated as more detailed information becomes available.In addition, Management makes judgements in the process of applying the entity’s accounting policies, for example the classification of a transaction as an asset acquisition or a business combination.Management regards those listed below as the key accounting estimates and judgements used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements. Please refer to the specific notes for further information on the key accounting estimates and judgements as well as assumptions applied. Applying materialityThe consolidated financial statements are a result of processing large numbers of transactions and aggregating those transactions into classes according to their nature or function. The transactions are presented in classes of similar items in the consolidated financial statements. If a line item is not individually material, it is aggregated with other items of a similar nature in the consolidated financial statements or in the notes.Management provides specific disclosures required by IFRS unless the information is not applicable or is considered immaterial to the decision-making of the primary users of these financial statements.1.2 Changes in accounting policies and disclosuresAdoption of new or amended IFRSsManagement has assessed the impact of new or amended and revised accounting standards and interpretations (IFRSs) issued by the IASB and IFRSs endorsed by the European Union effective on or after 1 January 2020.  The Group adopted the amendments to IFRS 3 for the first time in 2020. The amendments narrow and clarify the definition of a business and permit a simplified assessment of whether an acquired set of activities and assets is a group of assets rather than a business (concentration test). The amendments are applied prospectively to all business combinations and asset acquisitions with an acquisition date on or after 1 January 2020.It is assessed that application of other new amendments effective from  1 January 2020 has not had a material impact on the consolidated financial statements in 2020. Furthermore, Management does not anticipate any significant impact on future periods from the adoption of these new amendments. Adoption of new or amended IFRSs in prior periods As of 1 January 2019, Novo Nordisk applied IFRS 16 'Leases' for the first time. The standard was implemented using the modified retrospective approach. On transition to IFRS 16 the Group recognised an additional DKK 3,778 million of right-of-use assets and DKK 3,988 million of lease liabilities. The implementation did not have any impact on equity. As of 1 January 2018, Novo Nordisk applied IFRS 9 'Financial Instruments' and IFRS 15 'Revenue from contracts with customers' for the first time. The impact of the implementation of IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 was immaterial in relation to recognition and measurement.The consolidated financial statements included in this Annual Report have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act. All entities in the Novo Nordisk Group follow the same Group accounting policies.Measurement basisThe consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments, equity investments and trade receivables in a factoring portfolio, which are measured at fair value.Except for the changes described in note 1.2, the principal accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements for all the years presented. The general accounting policies are described in note 5.5.Principal accounting policiesNovo Nordisk’s accounting policies are described in each of the individual notes to the consolidated financial statements. Accounting policies listed in the table below are regarded as the principal accounting policies applied by Management.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  522.1 Net sales and rebatesGross-to-net sales reconciliationDKK million202020192018Gross sales298,187270,431230,701US Managed Care and Medicare(96,716)(84,202)(65,207)US wholesaler charge-backs(37,036)(33,772)(29,469)US Medicaid rebates(17,307)(14,365)(11,950)Other US discounts and sales returns(10,867)(8,280)(6,606)Non-US rebates, discounts and sales returns(9,315)(7,791)(5,638)Total gross-to-net sales adjustments(171,241)(148,410)(118,870)Net sales126,946122,021111,831Provisions for sales rebatesDKK million202020192018At the beginning of the year30,87825,76020,374Additional provisions, including increases to existing provisions111,921102,78282,631Amount paid during the year(106,116)(98,655)(78,647)Adjustments, including unused amounts reversed during the year166381386Effect of exchange rate adjustment(2,797)6101,016At the end of the year34,05230,87825,760Sales discounts and sales rebates are predominantly issued in the US.

PBMs and managed healthcare plans play a role in negotiating price concessions with drug manufacturers for both the commercial and government channels, and determine which drugs are covered on their formularies (or 'preferred drug lists').US Managed Care and MedicareFor Managed Care and Medicare, rebates are offered to a number of PBMs and managed healthcare plans. These rebate programmes allow the customer to receive a rebate after attaining certain performance parameters relating to formulary status or pre-established market shares thresholds. Rebates are estimated according to the specific terms in each agreement, historical experience, anticipated channel mix, growth rates and market share information. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Managed Care and Medicare rebates are generally settled around 100 days from the transaction date.US wholesaler charge-backsWholesaler charge-backs relate to contractual arrangements between Novo Nordisk and indirect customers in the US whereby products are sold at contract prices lower than the list price originally charged to wholesalers. A wholesaler charge-back represents the difference between the invoice price to the wholesaler and the indirect customer’s contract price. Accruals are calculated for estimated charge-backs using a combination of factors such as historical experience, current wholesaler inventory levels, contract terms and the value of claims received but not yet processed. Wholesaler charge-backs are generally settled within 30 days after receipt of claim.US Medicaid rebatesMedicaid is a government insurance programme. Medicaid rebates have been estimated using a combination of historical experience, product and population growth, price changes, and the impact of contracting strategies. The calculation also involves interpretation of relevant regulations that are subject to changes in interpretative guidance from government authorities. Novo Nordisk adjusts the provision periodically to reflect actual sales performance. Medicaid rebates are generally settled around 150 days from the transaction date.Other US and non-US discounts and sales returnsOther discounts are provided to distributors, wholesalers, hospitals, pharmacies, etc. They are usually linked to sales volume or provided as cash discounts. Discounts are calculated based on historical data and recorded as a reduction in gross sales at the time the related sales are recorded. Sales returns relate to damaged or expired products.Other net sales disclosuresIn 2020, Novo Nordisk had three major wholesalers distributing products in the US, representing 19%, 13% and 12% respectively of total net sales (19%, 14% and 12% in 2019 and 20%, 13% and 13% in 2018). Sales to these three wholesalers are within both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm.Net sales to be recognised from fulfilling existing customer contracts containing fixed or minimum sales volumes, with an original term greater than 12 months, are expected to be DKK 431 million within 12 months (DKK 544 million in 2019) and DKK 216 million thereafter (DKK 32 million in 2019).Novo Nordisk's sales are impacted by exchange rate changes. Refer to note 4.2 for development in key exchange rates.Accounting policiesRevenue from sale of goods is recognised when Novo Nordisk has transferred control of products sold to the buyer and it is probable that Novo Nordisk will collect the consideration to which it is entitled for transferring the products. Control of the products is transferred at a point in time, typically on delivery. The amount of sales to be recognised is based on the consideration Novo Nordisk expects to receive in exchange for its goods. When sales are recognised, Novo Nordisk also records estimates for a variety of sales deductions, including product returns as well as rebates and discounts to government agencies, wholesalers, health insurance companies, managed healthcare organisations and retail customers. Sales deductions are recognised as a reduction of gross sales to arrive at net sales, by assessing the expected value of the sales deductions (variable consideration). Where contracts contain customer acceptance criteria, Novo Nordisk recognises sales when the acceptance criteria are satisfied.In some markets, Novo Nordisk sells products on a sale-or-return basis. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of future returns, estimated product returns are recorded as a reduction in sales. Where shipments of new products are made on a sale-or-return basis, without sufficient historical experience for estimating sales returns, revenue is recorded based on estimated demand and acceptance rates for well-established products with similar market characteristics. If similar market characteristics do not exist, revenue is recorded when there is evidence of consumption or when the right of return has expired. Unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain (note 3.6).Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Wholesaler charge-backs are netted against trade receivable balances.

The segments include research, development, manufacturing and marketing of products within the following areas:– Diabetes and Obesity care: insulin, GLP-1 and related delivery systems, oral antidiabetic products (OAD), obesity and other serious chronic diseases.– Biopharm: haemophilia, growth disorders and hormone replacement therapy.Segment performance is evaluated on the basis of operating profit, consistent with the consolidated financial statements. Financial income and expenses, and income taxes are managed at Group level and are not allocated to business segments. There are no sales or other transactions between the business segments. Costs have been split between business segments according to a specific allocation. In addition, a small number of corporate overhead costs are allocated systematically between the segments. Other operating income has been allocated to the two segments based on the same principle. Accounting policiesOperating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to Executive Management and the Board of Directors. We consider Executive Management to be the operating decision-making body, as all significant decisions regarding business development and direction are taken in this forum. The impact of foreign currency hedging is recognised in the income statement in financial items. Please refer to notes 4.2, 4.3 and 4.9 for more details on hedging.Key accounting estimates of sales deductions and provisions for  sales rebatesSales deductions are estimated and provided for at the time the related sales are recorded. These estimates of unsettled rebate, discount and product return obligations require use of significant judgement, as not all conditions are known at the time of sale, for example total sales volume to a given customer. The estimates are based on analyses of existing contractual obligations and historical experience. Provisions are calculated on the basis of a percentage of sales for each product as defined by the contracts with the various customer groups. Provisions for sales rebates are adjusted to actual amounts as rebates, discounts and returns are processed. Novo Nordisk considers the provisions established for sales rebates to be reasonable and appropriate based on currently available information. However, the actual amount of rebates and discounts may differ from the amounts estimated by Management as more detailed information becomes available.Geographical areasSales to external customers attributed to the US are collectively the most material to the Group. The US and Mainland China are the only territories where sales contribute 10% or more of total net sales.In 2020 Novo Nordisk operated in two main commercial units:– International Operations– EMEA: Europe, the Middle East and Africa.– China: Mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan.– Rest of World: All other countries except for North America.– North America Operations (the US and Canada)International Operations was reorganised with effect from 1 April 2020, and the geographical reporting has been amended to reflect the new organisation. Amounts for 2018 and 2019 have been restated. Refer to note 5.6 for an overview of companies in the Novo Nordisk Group based on geographical areas.The country of domicile is Denmark, which is part of EMEA. Denmark is immaterial to Novo Nordisk’s activities in terms of sales as 99.7% of total sales are realised outside Denmark. Sales are attributed to geographical areas according to the location of the customer.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements –

treatment of haemophilia and other rare blood disorders.– Human growth hormone and new modes of action for treatment of growth disorders and other rare endocrine disorders.– New modes of action including GLP-1 and stem cells for treatment of NASH, cardiovascular disease, Alzheimer's disease, chronic kidney disease and Parkinson's disease, among others.The research activities mainly utilise biotechnological methods based on advanced protein chemistry and protein engineering. These methods have played a key role in the development of the production technology used to manufacture insulin, GLP-1, recombinant blood-clotting factors and human growth hormone. Research activities further focus on new technology platforms including stem cells and developing RNAi therapies for liver-related cardio-metabolic diseases.Research and development activities are carried out by Novo Nordisk’s research and development centres, mainly in Denmark, the US, the UK and China. Clinical trials are carried out all over the world. Novo Nordisk also enters into partnerships and licence agreements.Accounting policiesNovo Nordisk expenses all research costs. In line with industry practice, internal and subcontracted development costs are also expensed as they are incurred, due to significant regulatory uncertainties and other uncertainties inherent in the development of new products. This means that they do not qualify for capitalisation as intangible assets until marketing approval by a regulatory authority is obtained or considered highly probable. Costs for post-approval activities that are required by authorities as a condition for obtaining regulatory approval are recognised as research and development costs. Research and development costs primarily comprise employee costs, and internal and external costs related to execution of studies, including manufacturing costs and facility costs of the research centres. The costs also comprise amortisation, depreciation and impairment losses related to software and property, plant and equipment used in the research and development activities. Impairment losses recognised on intangible assets not yet available for use related to research and development projects are presented in research and development costs.Certain research and development activities are recognised outside research and development costs:– Royalty expenses paid to partners after regulatory approval are expensed as cost of goods sold.– Royalty income received from partners is recognised as part of other operating income, net.– Contractual research and development obligations to be paid in the future are disclosed separately as commitments in note 5.2.2.4 Employee costsDKK million202020192018Wages and salaries26,77825,33525,259Share-based payment costs (note 5.1)823363414Pensions – defined contribution plans1,9611,9101,791Pensions – defined benefit plans (note 3.5)13815173Other social security contributions1,8621,9631,901Other employee costs2,0442,2032,087Total employee costs for the year33,60631,92531,525Employee costs capitalised as intangible assets and property, plant and equipment(1,279)(1,314)(1,500)Change in employee costs capitalised as inventories(60)(139)(105)Total employee costs in the income statement32,26730,47229,920Included in the income statement:Cost of goods sold8,8968,1348,164Sales and distribution costs14,14613,46312,214Research and development costs6,2695,9686,288Administrative costs2,8482,6792,755Other operating income, net108228499Total employee costs in the income statement32,26730,47229,920Number of employees202020192018Average number of  full-time employees43,75942,21842,881Year-end number of  full-time employees44,72342,70342,672Employees (total)45,32343,25843,202\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  562.5 Other operating income, netAccounting policiesOther operating income, net, comprises licence income and income of a secondary nature in relation to the main activities of Novo Nordisk. Licence income from royalties on net sales is recognised as the underlying customers' sale occurs and from sales milestones once the contingent sale milestone is achieved in accordance with the terms of the relevant agreement. Income from the transfer of the right to use intellectual property may contain development or regulatory milestones (variable consideration) on which the income is recognised when the significant uncertainties in achieving the milestones are resolved, due to the significant uncertainties inherent in the development of pharmaceutical products. Operating profit from the wholly owned subsidiary NNE A/S, not related to Novo Nordisk’s main activities, is recognised as other operating income. Other operating income also includes income from sale of intellectual property rights.Remuneration to Executive Management and Board of Directors DKK million202020192018Salary and short-term incentive119120102Pension262622Benefits10144Long-term incentive1524022Severance payments——28Executive Management in total2207200178Fee to Board of Directors2171917Total2242191951.

Swiss tax reformIn 2019, a tax reform was passed in Switzerland. The tax reform has a minor positive impact on the effective tax rate, driven by a non-recurring increase to deferred tax assets.Accounting policiesThe tax expense for the period comprises current and deferred tax. It also includes adjustments to previous years and changes in provisions for uncertain tax positions. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it relates to items recognised in equity or other comprehensive income.Provisions for ongoing tax disputes are included as part of deferred tax assets, tax receivables and tax payables.Deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the accounting and tax values of the individual consolidated companies and from realisable tax loss carry-forwards. The tax value of tax loss carry-forwards is included in deferred tax assets to the extent that these are expected to be utilised in future taxable income. The deferred income taxes are measured according to current tax rules and at the tax rates assumed in the year in which the assets are expected to be utilised. In general, the Danish tax rules related to dividends from group companies provide exemption from tax for most repatriated profits. A provision for withholding tax is only recognised if a concrete distribution of dividends is planned. The unrecognised potential withholding tax amounts to DKK 337 million (DKK 315 million in 2019). The value of future tax deductions in relation to share programmes is recognised as deferred tax, until the shares are paid out to the employees. Any estimated excess tax deduction compared to the costs realised in the income statement is charged to equity.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  57Management judgement regarding recognition of deferred income tax assets and provisions for uncertain tax positionsNovo Nordisk is subject to income taxes around the world. Significant judgement and estimates are required in determining the worldwide accrual for income taxes, deferred income tax assets and liabilities, and provisions for uncertain tax positions.Novo Nordisk recognises deferred income tax assets if it is probable that sufficient taxable income will be available in the future, against which the temporary differences and unused tax losses can be utilised. Management has considered future taxable income and applied its judgement in assessing whether deferred income tax assets should be recognised.In the course of conducting business globally, tax and transfer pricing disputes with tax authorities may occur. Management judgement is applied to assess the possible outcome of such disputes. The 'most probable outcome' method is applied when making provisions for uncertain tax positions, and Novo Nordisk considers the provisions made to be adequate. However, the actual obligation may deviate and depends on the result of litigation and settlements with the relevant tax authorities.Development in deferred income tax assets and liabilitiesDKK millionProperty, plant and equipment Intangible assetsInventories LiabilitiesOtherOffset within countriesTotal2020Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 1 January(1,591)(718)1,8113,4521,087—4,041Income/(charge) to the income statement(47)(2,883)9631,4495202Income/(charge) to other comprehensive income—92(216)16(469)(577)Income/(charge) to equity—(92)——20(72)Acquisition of subsidiaries————276276Effect of exchange rate adjustment241(2)(300)(30)(307)Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 31 December(1,614)(3,600)2,5564,6171,404—3,363Classified as follows:Deferred tax asset at 31 December755462,5684,8952,903(5,302)5,865Deferred tax liability at 31 December(2,369)(3,646)(12)(278)(1,499)5,302(2,502)2019Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 1 January(703)(564)9732,402667—2,775Change in accounting policy, leases(865)——865——Income/(charge) to the income statement(5)(155)8201336891,482Income/(charge) to other comprehensive income——1847(296)(231)Income/(charge) to equity————1818Disposal of subsidiaries———(18)—(18)Effect of exchange rate adjustment(18)1—23915Net deferred tax asset/(liability) at 31 December(1,591)(718)1,8113,4521,087—4,041Classified as follows:Deferred tax asset at 31 December769583,4283,5801,843(5,557)4,121Deferred tax liability at 31 December(2,360)(776)(1,617)(128)(756)5,557(80)The total tax value of unrecognised tax loss carry-forwards amounts to DKK 628 million in 2020 (DKK 144 million in 2019).\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  583.1 Intangible assets and property, plant and equipmentOf total property, plant and equipment and intangible assets, DKK 44,431 million is located in Denmark (DKK 28,322 million in 2019) and DKK 18,750 million is located in the US (DKK 20,256 million in 2019) where the Group's main production, filling, packaging, moulding, assembly facilities and intangible assets are located.

An addition of DKK 4,580 million was recognised in patents and licences for the acquisition of Ziltivekimab, a fully human monoclonal antibody directed against Interleukin-6 related to chronic kidney disease, which is under development.Novo Nordisk acquired Emisphere Technologies Inc. and obtained ownership of the Eligen® SNAC oral delivery technology. Novo Nordisk and Emisphere have collaborated since 2007 and Emisphere’s proprietary drug delivery technology Eligen® SNAC is used by Novo Nordisk under an existing licence agreement in the oral formulation of Novo Nordisk’s GLP-1 receptor agonist semaglutide, which is marketed and sold under the brand name Rybelsus®. Under the terms of the agreement, Novo Nordisk acquired all outstanding shares of Emisphere for USD 1,335 million. As part of the transaction, Novo Nordisk also acquired related Eligen® SNAC royalty stream obligations owed to MHR Fund Management LLC (MHR), the largest shareholder of Emisphere, for USD 450 million. The transaction has been accounted for as an asset acquisition, with DKK 11,060 million recognised in patents and licences, of which DKK 2,467 million are related to assets under development. At 31 December 2020, the carrying amount of acquired intangible assets related to Rybelsus is DKK 7,716 million, which has a remaining amortisation period of 14 years.Of the total addition of intangible assets in 2020 DKK 396 million is internally developed (DKK 221 million in 2019).Accounting policiesPatents and licences, including patents and licences acquired for research and development projects, are carried at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and any impairment loss. Upfront fees and acquisition costs are capitalised and subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event will be capitalised on the contingent event being probable of being achieved.Amortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life. This means the legal duration or the economic useful life depending on which is shorter, and not exceeding 15 years. The amortisation of patents and licences begins after regulatory approval has been obtained. Internal development of software for internal use are recognised as intangible assets if the recognition criteria are met, for example a significant business system where the expenditure leads to the creation of a durable asset. Amortisation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful life of 3-15 years. The amortisation begins when the asset is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management.Research and development projectsInternal and subcontracted research costs are charged in full to the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred. Consistent with industry practice, development costs are also expensed until regulatory approval is obtained or is probable; please refer to note 2.3.Payments to third parties under collaboration and licence agreements are assessed for the substance of their nature. Payments which represent subcontracted research and development are expensed as the services are received. Payments which represent rights to the transfer of intellectual property, developed at risk by the third party, are capitalised.For acquired research and development projects, patents and licences, the likelihood of obtaining future commercial sales is reflected in the cost of the asset, and thus the probability recognition criteria is always considered to be satisfied. As the cost of acquired research and development projects can often be measured reliably, these projects fulfil the capitalisation criteria as intangible assets on acquisition. Subsequent milestone payments payable on achievement of a contingent event (e.g. commencement of phase 3 trials) are accrued and capitalised into the cost of the intangible asset when the achievement of the event is probable. Development costs incurred subsequent to acquisition are treated consistently with internal project development costs.Assets that are subject to amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Factors considered material that could trigger an impairment test include  the following:– Development of a competing drug.– Changes in the legal framework covering patents, rights and licences.– Advances in medicine and/or technology that affect the medical treatments.– Lower-than-predicted sales.– Adverse impact on reputation and/or brand names.– Changes in the economic lives of similar assets.– Relationship to other intangible assets or property, plant and equipment.– Changes or anticipated changes in participation rates or reimbursement policies.If the carrying amount of intangible assets exceeds the recoverable amount based on the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment, any impairment is measured based on discounted projected cash flows. Impairments are reviewed at each reporting date for possible reversal. Key accounting estimates and judgements on intangible assets In 2020, an impairment loss of DKK 350 million (DKK 982 million in 2019) was recognised, substantially all of which related to patents and licences. DKK 350 million (DKK 282 million in 2019) of the impairment was related to the Diabetes and Obesity care segment and none related to Biopharm (DKK 700 million in 2019). All the impairment loss in 2020 was recognised in research and development costs (DKK 529 million in cost of goods sold and DKK 450 million in research and development costs in 2019). The impairment was a result of Management’s review of expectations related to patents and licences not yet in use. No impairment related to marketable products was identified in 2020.Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and intangible assets not yet available for use are not subject to amortisation. They are tested annually for impairment, irrespective of whether there is any indication that they may be impaired. Intangible assets not yet being amortised amounts to DKK 9,607 million (DKK 3,380 million in 2019), primarily patents and licences in relation to research and development projects. Impairment tests in 2020 and 2019 of patents and licences not yet in use are based on Management’s projections and anticipated net present value of estimated future cash flows from marketable products. Terminal values used are based on the expected life of products, forecasted life cycle and cash flow over that period, and the useful life of the underlying assets. In addition, Management makes judgements related to intangible assets when assessing whether a transaction is a business combination or an asset acquisition. An asset acquisition will arise when substantially all the transaction value is concentrated in a single asset or when there are no substantive business processes in the acquired entity. Judgements are also made in evaluating whether payments under collaboration arrangements are acquisition of assets or prepayment of R&D services. \fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  60Property, plant and equipment Depreciation and impairment lossesDKK million202020192018Cost of goods sold2,7292,6562,312Sales and distribution costs40335469Research and development costs724783468Administrative costs43337670Other operating income, net18236Total depreciation and impairment losses4,3074,1922,925Capital expenditure in the reporting period was primarily related to investments in facility upgrades and new production facilities for active pharmaceutical ingredients for diabetes, mainly the facility in Clayton, US. The facility in Clayton is intended to strengthen the Novo Nordisk supply chain. Capital expenditure also related to investments in facility upgrades of the purification plant in Kalundborg and investments were also made to establish additional API capacity in Kalundborg. Finally, capital expenditure related to the establishment of an oral tablet facility near Durham, US for launch and commercial manufacturing of tablets.Accounting policiesProperty, plant and equipment is measured at historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment loss. The cost of self-constructed assets includes costs directly and indirectly attributable to the construction of the assets. Any subsequent cost is included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a separate asset only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the item will flow to Novo Nordisk and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Depreciation is based on the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets (buildings: 12-50 years, plant and machinery: 5-25 years and other equipment: 3-10 years. Land is not depreciated).The depreciation commences when the asset is available for use, i.e. when it is in the location and condition necessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by Management. The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at the end of each reporting period. If an asset’s carrying amount is higher than its estimated recoverable amount, it is written down to the recoverable amount. Plant and equipment with no alternative use developed as part of a research and development project are expensed. However, plant and equipment with an alternative use or used for general research and development purposes are capitalised and depreciated over the estimated useful life as research and development costs. 3.2 LeasesRight-of-use assets in the balance sheetDKK millionLand and buildingsOther equipmentTotal2020Balance at 1 January3,0295033,532Additions during the year660318978Depreciation for the year(644)(320)(964)Effect of exchange rate adjustment(144)(22)(166)Balance at 31 December2,9014793,3802019Balance at 1 January3,2914873,778Additions during the year333307640Depreciation for the year(564)(288)(852)Effect of exchange rate adjustment(31)(3)(34)Balance at 31 December3,0295033,532Amounts recognised in the income statementDKK million20202019Depreciation964852Interest on lease liabilities97108Variable lease expenses135113Short-term leases 98201Lease of low value assets7963Total amounts recognised in the  income statement1,3731,337In 2020 the total cash outflow for leases amounted to DKK 1,367 million (DKK 1,295 million in 2019). Please refer to note 4.4 for a maturity analysis of lease payments. The lease costs for 2018 were DKK 1,299 million. Accounting policiesNovo Nordisk mainly leases office buildings, warehouses, laboratories and vehicles. The right-of-use asset is presented in property, plant and equipment and the lease liability in borrowings. For contracts which are, or contain, a lease, the Group recognises a right-of-use asset and a lease liability. The right-of-use asset is initially measured at cost, being the initial amount of the lease liability. The right-of-use asset is subsequently depreciated using the straight-line method over the lease term. The right-of-use asset is periodically adjusted for certain remeasurements of the lease liability and reduced by any impairment losses. The lease term determined by the Group is the non-cancellable period of a lease, together with extension/termination option if these are reasonably certain to be exercised. When determining the term, Management considers multiple factors that create economic incentives to exercise an option to extend the lease or not to terminate the lease, including termination penalties, potential relocation costs and whether significant leasehold improvements have been capitalised on the lease, with a remaining useful life which exceeds the fixed minimum duration of the lease. For contracts with a rolling term (evergreen leases), the Group estimates the leasing period to be equal to the termination period if no probable scenario exists for estimating the leasing period. The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments outstanding at the commencement date, discounted using the incremental borrowing rate. The lease liability is measured using the effective interest method. Variable lease payments not based on an index or a rate are recognised as an expense in the income statement as incurred. Residual value guarantees that are expected to be paid are included in the initial measurement of the lease liability. The lease liability is remeasured when there is a change in future lease payments, typically due to a change in index or rate (e.g. inflation) on property leases, or if there is a reassessment of whether an extension or termination option will be exercised. A corresponding adjustment is made to the right-of-use asset, or in the income statement when the right-of-use asset has been fully depreciated.New lease contracts with a lease term of 12 months or less and lease of low value assets are not recognised on the balance sheet. These are expensed on a straight-line basis over the lease term or another systematic basis. Lease of low value assets include personal computers, telephones and small items of office equipment.As of 31 December 2020, the lease liability excludes DKK 2,363 million (undiscounted) of potential lease payments related to lease term extension rights on properties which were not considered reasonably certain to be exercised (DKK 2,760 million in 2019).\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  613.3 InventoriesDKK million20202019Raw materials3,3262,842Work in progress12,25211,375Finished goods5,1114,850Total inventories (gross)20,68919,067Write-downs at year-end(2,153)(1,426)Total inventories (net)18,53617,641Indirect production costs included in work in  progress and finished goods9,7039,216Share of total inventories (net)52%52%Movements in inventory write-downs:Write-downs at the beginning of the year1,4261,959Write-downs during the year1,628414Utilisation of write-downs(528)(68)Reversal of write-downs(373)(879)Write-downs at the end of the year2,1531,426All write-downs in both 2020 and 2019 relate to fully impaired inventory.In 2019 a reversal of write-down on prelaunch inventory with a net positive income statement effect of DKK 510 million on research and development costs was recognised. Accounting policiesInventories are stated at cost or net realisable value, whichever is lower. Cost is determined using the first-in, first-out method. Cost comprises direct production costs such as raw materials, consumables and labour as well as indirect production costs. Production costs for work in progress and finished goods include indirect production costs such as employee costs, depreciation, maintenance, etc. If the expected sales price less completion costs to execute sales (net realisable value) is lower than the carrying amount, a write-down is recognised for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds its net realisable value.Inventory manufactured prior to regulatory approval (prelaunch inventory) is capitalised but immediately provided for, until there is a high probability of regulatory approval for the product. A write-down is made against inventory, and the cost is recognised in the income statement as research and development costs. Once there is a high probability of regulatory approval being obtained, the write-down is reversed, up to no more than the original cost.Key accounting estimate of indirect production costs capitalised and inventory write-downsIndirect production costs account for approximately 50% of the net inventory value, reflecting a lengthy production process compared with low direct raw material costs. The production of both Diabetes and Obesity care and Biopharm products is highly complex from fermentation to purification and formulation, including quality control of all production processes. Furthermore, the process is very sensitive to manufacturing conditions. These factors all influence the parameters for capitalisation of indirect production costs at Novo Nordisk and the full cost of the products. Indirect production costs are measured using a standard cost method. This is reviewed regularly to ensure relevant measures of capacity utilisation, production lead time, cost base and other relevant factors, hence inventory is valued at actual cost. When calculating total inventory, Management must make judgements about cost of production, standard cost variances and idle capacity in estimating indirect production costs for capitalisation. Changes in the parameters for calculation of indirect production costs could have an impact on the gross margin and the overall valuation of inventories.3.4 Trade receivablesDKK millionGross carrying amountLoss allowanceNet carrying amount2020Not yet due27,511(805)26,7061-90 days1,000(112)88891-180 days188(63)125181-270 days44(29)15271-360 days51(51)—More than 360 days past due320(320)—Trade receivables29,114(1,380)27,734EMEA6,306(781)5,525China2,137—2,137Rest of World3,003(580)2,423North America Operations17,668(19)17,649Trade receivables29,114(1,380)27,7342019Not yet due24,359(763)23,5961-90 days1,204(127)1,07791-180 days261(69)192181-270 days96(49)47271-360 days79(79)—More than 360 days past due397(397)—Trade receivables26,396(1,484)24,912EMEA7,104(903)6,201China1,760—1,760Rest of World3,084(568)2,516North America Operations14,448(13)14,435Trade receivables26,396(1,484)24,912Movements in allowance for doubtful trade receivablesDKK million20202019Carrying amount at the beginning of the year1,4841,370Reversal of allowance on realised losses(108)(45)Net movement recognised in income statement139158Effect of exchange rate adjustment(135)1Allowance at the end of the year1,3801,484\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  62Novo Nordisk closely monitors the current economic conditions of countries impacted by currency fluctuations, high inflation and an unstable political climate. These indicators as well as payment history are taken into account in the valuation of trade receivables. During 2020 country risk ratings have been downgraded in a number of countries. However, despite of the COVID-19 pandemic, Novo Nordisk has not experienced significant increases in collectability issues on individual customers nor have we experienced significant deterioration in the ageing of receivables. Please refer to note 4.2 for the trade receivable programmes.  Accounting policiesTrade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for doubtful trade receivables. The allocation of trade receivables and allowance for trade receivables is based on the location of the customer.Before being sold, trade receivables in factoring portfolios are measured at fair value with changes recognised in other comprehensive income. The allowance for doubtful receivables is deducted from the carrying amount of trade receivables, and the amount of the loss is recognised in the income statement under sales and distribution costs. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against sales and distribution costs.Novo Nordisk’s customer base comprises government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies and other customers. Management makes allowance for doubtful trade receivables based on the simplified approach to provide for expected credit losses, which permits the use of the lifetime expected loss provision for all trade receivables. The allowance is an estimate based on shared credit risk characteristics and the days past due. Generally, invoices are due for payment within 90 days from shipment of goods. Loss allowance is calculated using an ageing factor, geographical risk and specific customer knowledge. The allowance is based on a provision matrix on days past due and a forward looking-element relating mainly to incorporation of the Dun & Bradstreet country risk rating and an individual assessment. Please refer to note 4.2 for a general description of credit risk.3.5 Retirement benefit obligationsNet retirement benefit obligationsDKK million20202019Retirement benefit obligations2,6242,508Fair value of plan assets1,2251,174Net retirement benefit obligations  at the end of the year1,3991,334Key assumptions used for valuation and sensitivity analysisDKK millionKey assumptions1%-point increase1%-point decrease2020Discount rate (decrease)/increase1.0%(403)523Future remuneration growth (decrease)/increase2.2%116(101)2019Discount rate (decrease)/increase1.3%(366)465Future remuneration growth (decrease)/increase2.4%105(94)The sensitivities consider the single change shown, with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. The table shows the NPV impact of net retirement liabilities.Defined contribution plansNovo Nordisk operates a number of defined contribution plans throughout the world. These plans are externally funded in entities that are legally separate from the Group. Defined benefit plansIn a few countries, Novo Nordisk operates defined benefit plans, primarily located in the US, Germany, Switzerland and Japan. In Germany and Switzerland, the defined benefit plans are partly reimbursed by international insurance companies. The risk related to the plan assets in these countries is therefore limited to counterparty risk against these insurance companies. The total cost recognised for the year amounts to DKK 138 million (DKK 151 million in 2019).The present value of partly funded retirement benefit obligations amounts to DKK 1,953 million (DKK 1,845 million in 2019). The present value of unfunded retirement benefit obligations amounts to DKK 671 million (DKK 663 million in 2019).Net remeasurement is a loss of DKK 67 million (loss of DKK 187 million in 2019), primarily related to changes in financial assumptions (discount rate), and is included in other comprehensive income.Please refer to note 5.2 for a maturity analysis of the net retirement benefit obligation. Novo Nordisk does not expect the contributions over the next five years to differ significantly from current contributions.Accounting policiesDefined contribution plansNovo Nordisk’s contributions to the defined contribution plans are charged to the income statement in the year to which they relate.Defined benefit plansThe costs for the year for defined benefit plans are determined using the projected unit credit method. This reflects services rendered by employees to the valuation dates and is based on actuarial assumptions primarily regarding discount rates used in determining the present value of benefits and projected rates of remuneration growth. Discount rates are based on the market yields of high-rated corporate bonds in the country concerned.Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement.Pension plan assets are only recognised to the extent that Novo Nordisk is able to derive future economic benefits such as refunds from the plan or reductions of future contributions. Costs recognised for retirement benefits are included in cost of goods sold, sales and distribution costs, research and development costs, and administrative costs. The net obligation recognised in the balance sheet is reported as non-current liabilities.Actuarial valuations are performed annually for all major defined benefit plans. Assumptions regarding future mortality are based on actuarial advice in accordance with published statistics and experience in each country. Other assumptions such as medical cost trend rate and inflation are also considered in the calculation. Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of the retirement benefit obligation (not considering plan assets) are discount rate and expected future remuneration increases. The sensitivity analysis has been determined based on reasonably likely changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the period.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  633.6 Provisions and contingent liabilitiesDKK millionProvisionsfor salesrebates1Provisions for legal disputesProvisions for product returnsOtherprovisions22020 total2019 totalAt the beginning of the year30,8782,3751,0821,39835,73329,553Additional provisions, including increases to existing provisions111,921662413814113,810104,621Amount used during the year(106,116)(364)(694)(46)(107,220)(99,244)Adjustments, including unused amounts reversed during the year166—(6)(82)78148Effect of exchange rate adjustment(2,797)(222)—(42)(3,061)655At the end of the year34,0522,4517952,04239,34035,733Non-current liabilities33012,2092931,7234,5264,613Current liabilities33,75124250231934,81431,1201. Provisions for sales rebates are related to US Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid and other minor US rebate types, as well as rebates in a number of European countries and Canada.2. Other provisions consists of various types of provision, including obligations in relation to employee benefits such as jubilee benefits, company-owned life insurance, etc.3. For non-current liabilities, provision for sales rebates is expected to be settled after one year, provisions for product returns will be utilised in 2022 and 2023. In the case of provisions for legal disputes, the timing of settlement cannot be determined.Contingent liabilitiesNovo Nordisk is currently involved in pending litigations, claims and investigations arising out of the normal conduct of its business. While provisions that Management deems to be reasonable and appropriate have been made for probable losses, there are uncertainties connected with these estimates. Novo Nordisk does not expect the pending litigations, claims and investigations, individually and in the aggregate, to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow in addition to the amounts accrued as provision for legal disputes.Pending litigation against Novo NordiskNovo Nordisk, along with the majority of incretin-based product manufacturers in the United States, is a defendant in product liability lawsuits related to use of incretin-based medications. As of 1 February 2021, 384 plaintiffs have named Novo Nordisk in product liability lawsuits, predominantly claiming damages for pancreatic cancer that allegedly developed as a result of using Victoza® and other GLP-1/DPP-IV incretin-based products. 236 of the Novo Nordisk plaintiffs have also named other defendants in their lawsuits. Most Novo Nordisk plaintiffs have filed suit in California federal and state courts. Novo Nordisk does not currently have any individual trials scheduled in 2021. Novo Nordisk does not expect the pending claims to have a material impact on its financial position, operating profit or cash flow. Since January 2017, several class action lawsuits have been filed against Novo Nordisk, former CEO Lars Rebien Sørensen, former CFO Jesper Brandgaard and former President of Novo Nordisk Inc. Jakob Riis in the United States District Court for the District of New Jersey on behalf of all purchasers of Novo Nordisk American Depositary Receipts between February 2015 and February 2017. All lawsuits have been consolidated into one case. The lawsuit alleges that Novo Nordisk artificially inflated its financial results, failed to disclose pricing pressure and rising rebate payments to PBMs, and made other materially misleading statements to potential investors. Novo Nordisk does not expect the litigation to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.In August 2019, a securities lawsuit was filed against Novo Nordisk in Denmark by a number of institutional shareholders. The claim is for a total amount of DKK 11.8 billion based on trading and holding of shares in Novo Nordisk during the period between February 2015 and February 2017. The lawsuit alleges that Novo Nordisk made misleading statements and did not make appropriate disclosures regarding its sales of insulin products in the US. It contains broadly similar allegations to those of the previously disclosed securities class action lawsuit filed in the US in 2017 on behalf of all purchasers of Novo Nordisk American Depository Receipts. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuit to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.Novo Nordisk is currently defending six lawsuits, including two plead as putative class actions, relating to the pricing of diabetes medicines. Four of these cases are pending in New Jersey federal court; the other two are pending in Kentucky state court and Texas federal court. All pending matters also name as defendants Eli Lilly and Company and Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC; while certain matters also name Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) and related entities. Plaintiffs generally allege that the manufacturers and PBMs colluded to artificially inflate list prices paid by consumers for diabetes products, while offering reduced prices to PBMs through rebates used to secure formulary access. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuits to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.In 2016, Novo Nordisk US received a Civil Investigative Demand from the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ CID”) relating to potential off-label marketing of NovoSeven® (including high dose and for prophylactic use) and interactions with physicians and patients. The DOJ investigation was likely prompted by a lawsuit filed by a former Novo Nordisk US employee (the “Relator”) under seal in the Western District of Oklahoma in 2015. Relator alleges Novo Nordisk US caused the submission of false claims to Medicare, Medicaid, Federal Employees Health Benefits Program and private insurers in California as a result of the same conduct that was the subject of the DOJ CID. As a result of these allegations, Relator (on behalf of the federal and state governments) seeks injunctive and monetary relief. A consolidated complaint was jointly filed by relator and the State of Washington on 9 March 2020. The consolidated complaint was unsealed (made public) by the court on 28 May 2020. Novo Nordisk has filed two motions seeking dismissal of the Complaint, both of which are currently pending and awaiting ruling from the Court. Novo Nordisk does not expect the lawsuit to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.Pending claims against Novo Nordisk and investigations involving Novo NordiskSeveral authorities in the US have served Novo Nordisk with Civil Investigative Demands (CIDs) or subpoenas calling for the production of documents and information. Below is a list of ongoing matters:– Washington Attorney General’s Office CID (March 2017), relating to, among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products, including Levemir®, NovoLog®, and Novolin®, from 1 January 2005 through the present date.– New Mexico Attorney General’s Office CID (April 2017), relating to, among other things, trade practice and pricing of insulin products, namely NovoLog® and Novolin® from 1 January 2012 through the present date.– Texas Attorney General’s Office CID (March 2019), relating to, among other things, marketing and promotional practices for Ozempic®. \fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  64– New York State Attorney General’s Office Subpoena (July 2019), relating to, among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products, from 1 July 2013 through the present.– Colorado Attorney General’s Office CID (December2019), relating to, among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products, for the period from 1 January 2010 to present. – State of California Office of the Insurance Commissioner Subpoena (July 2020) related to Novo Nordisk’s patent and regulatory strategies for Prandin® and Prandimet® in the US market, and the projected impact of generic repaglinide on Novo Nordisk’s Prandin® and Prandimet® franchises in the US. – Mississippi Attorney General’s Office Subpoena (December 2020), related to, among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products, including Levemir®, NovoLog®, and Novolin®, from 1 January 2005 through the present date.– Vermont Attorney General’s Office Subpoena (December 2020), related to, among other things, pricing and trade practices for insulin products sold by Novo Nordisk during the period 1 January 2011 through the present date.In all matters Novo Nordisk is cooperating with the authority in question. Novo Nordisk does not expect the above investigations to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.Novo Nordisk is one of several pharmaceutical companies that received requests for information involving pricing practices for its diabetes products from several committees of the Unites States House of Representatives and/or United States Senate. Novo Nordisk is working with the staff of the various committees to respond to their questions. Novo Nordisk does not expect the inquiries to have a material impact on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.Other contingent liabilitiesIn addition to the above, the Novo Nordisk Group is engaged in certain litigation proceedings and various ongoing audits and investigations. In the opinion of Management, neither settlement or continuation of such proceedings, nor such pending audits and investigations, are expected to have a material effect on Novo Nordisk’s financial position, operating profit or cash flow.3.7 Other liabilitiesOther liabilities primarily comprises employee cost payables, payables related to non-current assets, and sales rebates.Accounting policiesProvisions for sales rebates and discounts granted to government agencies, wholesalers, retail pharmacies, Managed Care and other customers are recorded at the time the related revenues are recorded or when the incentives are offered. Provisions are calculated based on historical experience and the specific terms in the individual agreements. Unsettled rebates are recognised as provisions when the timing or amount is uncertain. Where absolute amounts are known, the rebates are recognised as other liabilities. Please refer to note 2.1 for further information on sales rebates and provisions.Provisions for legal disputes are recognised where a legal or constructive obligation has been incurred as a result of past events and it is probable that there will be an outflow of resources that can be reliably estimated. In this case, Novo Nordisk arrives at an estimate based on an evaluation of the most likely outcome. Disputes for which no reliable estimate can be made are disclosed as contingent liabilities.Provisions are measured at the present value of the anticipated expenditure for settlement. This is calculated using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision for interest is recognised as a financial expense.Novo Nordisk issues credit notes for expired goods as a part of normal business. Where there is historical experience or a reasonably accurate estimate of expected future returns can otherwise be made, a provision for estimated product returns is recorded. The provision is measured at gross sales value.Key accounting estimate regarding ongoing legal disputes, litigation and investigationsProvisions for legal disputes consist of various types of provision linked to ongoing legal disputes. Management makes estimates regarding provisions and contingencies, including the probability of pending and potential future litigation outcomes. These are by nature dependent on inherently uncertain future events. When determining likely outcomes of litigation, etc., Management considers the input of external counsels on each case, as well as known outcomes in case law.Although Management believes that the total provisions for legal proceedings are adequate based on currently available information, there can be no assurance that there will not be any changes in facts or matters, or that any future lawsuits, claims, proceedings or investigations will not be material.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  65Section 4 Capital structure and financial items4.1 Earnings per share, distributions to shareholders, treasury shares, share capital and other reservesEarnings per shareDKK million202020192018Net profit42,13838,95138,628Average number of shares outstandingin million shares2,333.92,374.32,419.6Dilutive effect of average outstanding share pool1in million shares6.14.44.8Average number of shares outstanding, including dilutive effect of outstanding share poolin million shares2,340.02,378.72,424.4Basic earnings  per shareDKK18.0516.4115.96Diluted earnings  per shareDKK18.0116.3815.931.

This is in line with the guiding principle of paying out excess capital to investors after funding organic growth and potential acquisitions.The total dividend for 2020 amounts to DKK 21,066 million (DKK 9.10 per share). The 2020 final dividend of DKK 13,496 million (DKK 5.85 per share) is expected to be distributed pending approval at the Annual General Meeting. The interim dividend of DKK 7,570 million (DKK 3.25 per share) was paid in August 2020. The total dividend for 2019 was DKK 19,651 million (DKK 8.35 per share), of which the final dividend of DKK 12,551 million (DKK 5.35 per share) was paid in March 2020. No dividend is declared on treasury shares.According to Danish corporate law, reserves available for distribution as dividends are based on the financial statements of the parent company, Novo Nordisk A/S. Dividends are paid from distributable reserves. Share premium is a distributable reserve, and any former share premium reserve has been fully distributed. As at 31 December 2020, distributable reserves total DKK 51,858 million (DKK 40,801 million in 2019), corresponding to the parent company's retained earnings and cash flow hedge reserve.Treasury shares20202019Market value, DKK millionTreasury shares in %Number ofB sharesof DKK 0.20(million)Number ofB sharesof DKK 0.20(million)Holding at the beginning of the year18,6132.0%48.155.8Cancellation of treasury shares(19,333)(50.0)(50.0)Transfer regarding restricted stock units(148)(0.4)(2.6)Purchase during  the year16,85539.844.9Value adjustment29——Holding at the end of the year16,0161.6%37.548.1Treasury sharesTreasury shares are primarily acquired to reduce the company’s share capital. In addition, a limited part is used to finance Novo Nordisk’s long-term share-based incentive programme (restricted stock units) and restricted stock units to employees. Treasury shares are deducted from the share capital on cancellation at their nominal value of DKK 0.20 per share. Differences between this amount and the amount paid to acquire or received for disposing of treasury shares are deducted directly in equity.Novo Nordisk’s guiding principle is that any excess capital after the funding of organic growth opportunities and potential acquisitions should be returned to investors. Novo Nordisk's dividend payouts are complemented by share repurchase programmes.The purchase of treasury shares during the year relates to the remaining part of the 2019 share repurchase programme, totalling DKK 0.9 billion and the DKK 17 billion Novo Nordisk B share repurchase programme for 2020, of which DKK 1 billion was outstanding at year-end. The programme ended on 1 February 2021. Transfer of treasury shares relates to the long-term share-based incentive programme and restricted stock units to employees.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  664.2 Financial risksManagement has assessed the following key financial risks:TypeFinancial riskForeign exchange riskHighCredit riskLowInterest rate riskLowLiquidity riskLowNovo Nordisk has centralised management of the Group's financial risks. The overall objectives and policies for the company's financial risk management are outlined in an internal Treasury Policy, which is approved by the Board of Directors. The Treasury Policy consists of the Foreign Exchange Policy, the Investment Policy, the Financing Policy and the Policy regarding Credit Risk on Financial Counterparts, and includes a description of permitted use of financial instruments and risk limits.Novo Nordisk only hedges commercial exposures and consequently does not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes. Novo Nordisk uses a fully integrated treasury management system to manage all financial positions, and all positions are marked-to-market. Foreign exchange riskForeign exchange risk is the most important financial risk for Novo Nordisk and can have a significant impact on the income statement, statement of comprehensive income, balance sheet and cash flow statement.The overall objective of foreign exchange risk management is to reduce the short-term negative impact of exchange rate fluctuations on earnings and cash flow, thereby contributing to the predictability of the financial results.The majority of Novo Nordisk's sales are in USD, EUR, CNY, JPY, CAD and GBP. The foreign exchange risk is most significant in USD, CNY and JPY, while the EUR exchange rate risk is regarded as low because of Denmark's fixed exchange rate policy towards EUR.Novo Nordisk hedges existing assets and liabilities in key currencies as well as future expected cash flows up to a maximum of 24 months forward. Hedge accounting is applied to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in the consolidated income statement. Management has chosen to classify the result of hedging activities as part of financial items. During 2020, the hedging horizon varied between 5 and 13 months for USD, CNY, JPY, CAD and GBP. The currency hedging strategy balances risk reduction and cost of hedging by use of foreign exchange forwards and foreign exchange options matching the due dates of the hedged items. Expected cash flows are continually assessed using historical inflows, budgets and monthly sales forecasts. Hedge effectiveness is assessed on a regular basis. There is no expected ineffectiveness at 31 December 2020, primarily because hedging instruments match currencies of hedged cash flows. The financial contracts existing at year-end cover the expected future cash flow for the following number of months:20202019USD10 months9 monthsCNY16 months7 monthsJPY12 months12 monthsCAD9 months9 monthsGBP11 months10 months1.

Anticipated currency transactions, investments and non-current assets are not included.Credit riskCredit risk arises from the possibility that transactional counterparties may default on their obligations, causing financial losses for the Group. Novo Nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to financial counterparties to be DKK 15,089 million (DKK 15,663 million in 2019). In addition, Novo Nordisk considers its maximum credit exposure to trade receivables, other receivables (less prepayments and VAT receivables) and other financial assets to be DKK 29,522 million (DKK 26,622 million in 2019). Please refer to note 4.8 for details of the Group's total financial assets. To manage credit risk regarding financial counterparties, Novo Nordisk only enters into derivative financial contracts and money market deposits with financial counterparties possessing a satisfactory long-term credit rating from at least two out of the three selected ratings agencies: Standard and Poor's, Moody's and Fitch. Furthermore, maximum credit lines defined for each counterparty diversify the overall counterparty risk.

In the US, the three major wholesalers account for a large proportion of total net sales, see note 2.1. However, US wholesaler credit ratings are monitored and part of the trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms; see below for details. Novo Nordisk continues to monitor the credit exposure in countries with increasing sales and low credit ratings.Trade receivable programmesPlease refer to note 3.4 for the description of COVID-19’s impact on trade receivables including the loss allowance for the Group and ageing analysis. Novo Nordisk's subsidiaries in the US and Japan employ trade receivable programmes in which trade receivables are sold on full non-recourse terms to optimise working capital.At year-end, the Group had derecognised receivables without recourse having due dates after 31 December 2020 amounting to:DKK million202020192018US1,8173,6723,587Japan2,3512,1491,937In addition, full non-recourse off-balance-sheet factoring arrangement programmes are occasionally applied by Novo Nordisk subsidiaries around the world, with limited impact on the Group's trade receivables.Please refer to note 3.4 for the split of allowance for trade receivables by geographical segment.Interest rate riskNovo Nordisk has no significant exposure to interest rate risk as Novo Nordisk does not hold any significant interest-bearing marketable securities or non-current loans. Furthermore, net interest costs have low sensitivity towards interest rates due to the capital structure.Liquidity riskThe liquidity risk is considered to be low. Novo Nordisk ensures the availability of the required liquidity through a combination of cash management, highly liquid investment portfolios and both uncommitted and committed credit facilities. Novo Nordisk uses cash pools for optimisation and centralisation of cash management.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  684.3 Derivative financial instrumentsDerivative financial instruments20202019DKK millionContract amount at year-endPositive fair value at year-endNegative fair value at year-endContract amount at year-endPositive fair value at year-endNegative fair value at year-endForward contracts USD129,1101,658—25,39481315Forward contracts CNH, JPY, GBP and CAD10,2911914710,01335130Forward contracts, cash flow hedges39,4011,8494735,407116445Forward contracts USD19,4113791,30711,28761217Forward contracts CNH, CAD, EUR, GBP and JPY4,578104113,7611172Forward contracts, fair value hedges23,9894831,31815,04872289Total derivative financial instruments63,3902,3321,36550,455188734Recognised in the income statement4831,31872289Recognised in other comprehensive income21,849471164451. Average hedge rate for USD cash flow hedges is 640 at the end of 2020 and 654 at the end of 2019.2. The fair value of cash flow hedges at year-end 2020, DKK 1,802 million, is recognised in other comprehensive income. In addition DKK 418 million in cash flow hedge losses on intangible asset purchases has been incurred for a total 2020 other comprehensive impact of DKK 1,384 million. The DKK 418 million deferred loss was transferred directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the intangible assets.The financial contracts are expected to impact the income statement within the next 12 months, with deferred gains and losses on cash flow hedges then being transferred to financial income or financial expenses.Accounting policiesNovo Nordisk uses financial instruments to reduce the impact of foreign exchange on financial results.Use of derivative financial instrumentsThe derivative financial instruments are used to manage the exposure to market risk. None of the derivatives are held for trading.Novo Nordisk uses forward exchange contracts and, to a lesser extent, currency options to hedge forecast transactions, assets and liabilities. The overall policy is to hedge the majority of total currency exposure.Net investments in foreign subsidiaries are currently not hedged.Initial recognition and measurementOn initiation of the contract, Novo Nordisk designates each derivative financial contract that qualifies for hedge accounting as one of:– hedges of the fair value of a recognised asset or liability (fair value hedge)– hedges of the fair value of a forecast financial transaction (cash flow hedge).All contracts are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value at the end of the reporting period.Fair value hedgesValue adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in the income statement along with any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.Cash flow hedgesValue adjustments of the effective part of cash flow hedges are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. The cumulative value adjustment of these contracts is transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement. For cash flow hedges of foreign currency risk on highly probable non-financial asset purchases, the cumulative value adjustments are transferred directly from the cash flow hedge reserve to the initial cost of the asset when recognised.Discontinuance of cash flow hedgingWhen a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement under financial income or financial expenses.Fair value determinationThe fair value of derivative financial instruments is measured on the basis of quoted market prices of financial instruments traded in active markets. If an active market exists, the fair value is based on the most recently observed market price at the end of the reporting period.If a financial instrument is quoted in a market that is not active, Novo Nordisk bases its valuation on the most recent transaction price. Adjustment is made for subsequent changes in market conditions, for instance by including transactions in similar financial instruments assumed to be motivated by normal business considerations.If an active market does not exist, the fair value of standard and simple financial instruments, such as foreign exchange forward contracts, interest rate swaps, currency swaps and unlisted bonds, is measured according to generally accepted valuation techniques. Market-based parameters are used to measure the fair value.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  694.5 Cash and cash equivalents, financial reserves and free cash flowDKK million202020192018Cash and cash equivalentsCash at bank (note 4.2)12,75715,47515,638Borrowings1(531)(64)(9)Cash and cash equivalents12,22615,41115,629Financial reservesCash and cash equivalents12,22615,41115,629Undrawn committed credit facility211,53111,57811,574Undrawn bridge facility35,577——Borrowings1, 3(576)(595)(506)Financial reserves428,75826,39426,697Free cash flowDKK million202020192018Net cash generated from operating activities51,95146,78244,616Net cash used in investing activities(22,436)(11,509)(12,080)Repayment on lease liabilities(950)(822)—Free cash flow428,56534,45132,5361.

The restricted cash balance relates to subsidiaries in which availability of currency for remittance of funds is temporarily scarce.Accounting policiesThe cash flow statement is presented in accordance with the indirect method commencing with net profit for the year. Cash flows in foreign currencies are translated to DKK at the average exchange rate for the respective year.Cash from operating activities converts income statement items from the accrual basis of accounting to cash basis. As such, starting with net profit, non-cash items are reversed and actual payments included. The change in working capital is also taken into account, as this shows the development in money tied up in the balance sheet. Cash from investing activities shows payments related to the purchase and sale of Novo Nordisk’s long-term investments. This includes fixed assets such as construction of new production sites, intangible assets such as patents and licences, and financial assets.Cash and cash equivalents consists of cash offset by short-term bank overdrafts. Where short-term bank overdrafts are consistently overdrawn, they are excluded from cash and cash equivalents. The movement in such facilities is presented under financing activities in the cash flow statement. Financial reserves comprise the sum of cash and cash equivalents at the end of the year and undrawn committed credit and loan facilities, with a maturity of more than 12 months, less loans and bank overdrafts classified as liabilities arising from financing activities contractually obliged for repayment within 12 months of the balance sheet date.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  714.8 Financial assets and liabilitiesFinancial assets by categoryDKK million20202019Other financial assets1766970Derivative financial instruments (note 4.3)2,332188Financial assets at fair value through the income statement3,0981,158Other financial assets1300364Trade receivables11,64312,203Other receivables and prepayments (current and non-current)4,8354,275– less prepayments and VAT receivables(4,113)(3,899)Cash at bank (note 4.5)12,75715,475Financial assets at amortised cost25,42228,418Trade receivables in a factoring portfolio216,09112,709Financial assets at fair value through OCI16,09112,709Total financial assets at the end of the year by category144,61142,2851.

The fair value of trade receivables in a factoring portfolio is calculated based on the net invoice amount (invoice amount less charge-backs) less the fee payable to the factoring entity. The factoring fee is insignificant due to the short period between the time of sale to the factoring entity and the invoice due date and the rate applicable. Inputs into the estimate of US wholesaler charge-backs are described in note 2.1.Financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value can be categorised using the fair value measurement hierarchy above. There were no transfers between the ’Active market data’ and ’Directly or indirectly observable market data’ categories during 2020, 2019 or 2018. There are no significant intangible assets or items of property, plant and equipment measured at fair value.For a description of the credit quality of financial assets such as trade receivables, cash at bank, current debt and derivative financial instruments, refer to notes 4.2 and 4.3.Accounting policiesDepending on purpose, Novo Nordisk classifies investments into the following categories:– Financial assets at fair value through the income statement– Financial assets at amortised cost– Financial assets at fair value through OCIManagement determines the classification of its financial assets on initial recognition and re-evaluates this at the end of every reporting period to the extent that such a classification is permitted or required.Recognition and measurementPurchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the settlement date. These are initially recognised at fair value.Fair value disclosures are made separately for each class of financial instruments at the end of the reporting period.Financial assets are removed from the balance sheet when the rights to receive cash flows have expired or have been transferred, and Novo Nordisk has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.Financial assets 'at fair value through the income statement'Financial assets at fair value through the income statement consist of equity investments and forward exchange contracts. Equity investments are included in other financial assets unless management intends to dispose of the investment within 12 months of the end of the reporting period. In that case, the current part is included in other receivables and prepayments.Net gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets are recognised in the income statement as financial income or expenses. The fair values of quoted investments are based on current bid prices at the end of the reporting period. Financial assets for which no active market exists are carried at fair value based on a valuation methodology.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  72Financial assets 'at amortised cost'Financial assets at amortised cost are cash at bank and non-derivative financial assets solely with payments of principal and interest. Novo Nordisk normally 'holds-to-collect' the financial assets to attain the contractual cash flows. If collection is expected within one year (or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer), they are classified as current assets. If not, they are presented as non-current assets.Trade receivables are initially recognised at transaction price and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequently they are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance for doubtful receivables. Financial assets 'at fair value through other comprehensive income'Financial assets at fair value through other comprehensive income are trade receivables that are held to collect or to sell in factoring agreements.Financial liabilities 'at fair value through the income statement'Financial liabilities at fair value through the income statement consist of forward exchange contracts.Financial liabilities 'at amortised cost'Financial liabilities at amortised cost consist of bank overdrafts, trade payables and other liabilities. 4.9 Financial income and expensesFinancial incomeDKK million202020192018Interest income13376551Foreign exchange gain (net)1,142——Financial gain from forward contracts (net)——1,656Financial gain from currency options (net)——152Capital gain on investments, etc.——251Result of associated companies149—12Total financial income1,628652,122Financial expensesDKK million202020192018Interest expenses139022085Foreign exchange loss (net)—5391,510Financial loss from forward contracts (net)1,8892,673—Capital loss on investments, etc.19514588Result of associated companies—137—Other financial expenses15028172Total financial expenses2,6243,9951,7551.

Financial items primarily relate to foreign exchange elements and are mainly impacted by the cumulative value adjustment of cash flow hedges transferred from other comprehensive income to the income statement when the hedged transaction is recognised in the income statement. In addition, value adjustments of fair value hedges are recognised in financial income and financial expenses along with any value adjustments of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk. Finally, value adjustments of foreign currency assets and liabilities in non-hedged currencies will impact financial income and financial expenses.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  73Section 5Other disclosures5.1 Share-based payment schemesShare-based payment expensed in the income statementDKK million202020192018Restricted stock units to employees18948204Long-term share-based incentive programme (Management Board)11628648Long-term share-based incentive programme (management group below Management Board)436195145Shares allocated to individual employees363417Share-based payment expensed in the income statement8233634141. In 2017 Novo Nordisk introduced, for the first time, a share-based compensation programme with terms which amortises the grant date valuation over four years. The 2020 expense includes amortisation of the 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 programmes. Restricted stock units to employeesIn appreciation of the efforts of employees during recent years, as of 1 August 2019, all employees in the company were offered 75 restricted stock units. A restricted stock unit gives the holder the right to receive one Novo Nordisk B share free of charge in February 2023 subject to continued employment. The cost of the DKK 660 million programme is amortised over the vesting period.Long-term share-based incentive programmeManagement BoardOn 2 February 2021, the Board of Directors approved the allocation of a total of 370,038 Novo Nordisk B shares to the members of the Management Board for the 2020 financial year. The value at launch of the programme (adjusted for expected dividends) was DKK 152 million. On average, this corresponds to 14.9 months’ fixed base salary plus pension contribution for the CEO, 11.2 months’ fixed base salary plus pension contribution per executive vice president as of 1 March 2020 and 8.3 months’ fixed base salary plus pension for senior vice presidents. The cost of the 2020 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2020-2023 at an annual amount of DKK 38 million. The amount of shares allocated may be reduced or increased by up to 30%, depending on whether the average sales growth per year in the three-year vesting period deviates from a target set by the Board of Directors. The grant date of the programme was February 2020, and the share price used for the determining the grant date fair value of the award was the average share price (DKK 435) for Novo Nordisk B shares on Nasdaq Copenhagen in the period 5-19 February 2020, adjusted for the expected dividend. Based on the split of participants when the share allocation was decided, 47% of the allocated shares will be allocated to members of Executive Management and 53% to other members of the Management Board.The shares allocated to the pool for 2017 were released to the individual participants subsequent to approval of the 2020 Annual Report by the Board of Directors and after the announcement of the 2020 full-year financial results on 3 February 2021. The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the programme of DKK 76 million, expensed over the vesting period of 2017-2020. The number of shares to be transferred (331,587 shares) is lower than the original number of shares allocated, as some participants had left the company before the programme's release conditions were met.All restricted stock units and shares allocated to Management are hedged by treasury shares.Management group below Management BoardThe management group below the Management Board has a share-based incentive programme with similar performance criteria. For 2020, a total of 1,011,692 shares were allocated to this group, corresponding to a value at launch of the programme (adjusted for expected dividends) of DKK 416 million. The cost of the 2020 programme is amortised over the vesting period of 2020-2023 at an annual amount of DKK 104 million. The amount of shares allocated may be reduced or increased by up to 30%, depending on whether the average sales growth per year in the three-year vesting period deviates from a target set by the Board of Directors.The shares allocated for 2017 were released to the individual participants subsequent to approval of the 2020 Annual Report by the Board of Directors and after the announcement of the 2020 full-year financial results on 3 February 2021. The shares allocated correspond to a value at launch of the programme of DKK 162 million amortised over the period 2017-2020. The number of shares to be transferred (635,516 shares) is lower than the original number of shares allocated, as some participants had left the company before the programme’s release conditions were met.Accounting policiesShare-based compensationNovo Nordisk operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant of shares is recognised as an expense and allocated over the vesting period.The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the shares granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. The fair value is fixed at the grant date, and adjusted for expected dividends during the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of shares that are expected to vest. At the end of each reporting period, Novo Nordisk revises its estimates of the number of shares expected to vest. Novo Nordisk recognises the impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, in the income statement and in a corresponding adjustment to equity (change in proceeds) over the remaining vesting period. Adjustments relating to prior years are included in the income statement in the year of adjustment.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Financial statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  74General terms and conditions of launched programmesRestricted stock units to employeesShares for Management BoardShares for management group below Management BoardShares allocated to individual employees202020192018202020192018202020192018202020192018Number of shares awarded in the year—2,148,580—370,038508,398411,0901,011,6921,300,3331,114,45543,790154,122159,437Value per share at launch (DKK)—307—411298280411298280391311278Total market value at launch (DKK million)—660—152152115416387312174844Amortisation period of the programme 2019 to 20232020 to 20232019 to 20222018 to 20212020 to 20232019 to 20222018 to 20212020 to 20232019 to 20222018 to 2021Allocated to recipientsFeb 2023Feb 2024Feb 2023Feb 2022Feb 2024Feb 2023Feb 2022202320222021Vesting period—3.5 years—3 years3 years3 years3 years3 years3 years3 years3 years3 yearsOutstanding restricted stock unitsTotalRestricted stock units to employeesShares for Management BoardShares for management group below Management BoardShares allocated to individual employees202020192018202020192018202020192018202020192018202020192018Outstanding at the beginning of the year6,879,1985,584,0194,933,8822,148,5801,521,0311,556,2111,326,0801,228,7141,115,4943,173,1852,665,2262,226,683231,353169,04835,494Released allocated shares(361,844)(2,553,658)(825,537)(29,250)(1,431,192)(35,180)(95,082)(378,421)(284,173)(171,162)(662,172)(480,301)(66,350)(81,873)(25,883)Cancelled allocated shares(129,713)(262,596)(209,308)—(89,839)—(12,700)(32,611)(13,697)(95,038)(130,202)(195,611)(21,975)(9,944)—Allocated in the year1,425,5204,111,4331,684,982—2,148,580—370,038508,398411,0901,011,6921,300,3331,114,45543,790154,122159,437Performance adjustment1863,557—————239,567——623,990—————Outstanding at the end of the year8,676,7186,879,1985,584,0192,119,3302,148,5801,521,0311,827,9031,326,0801,228,7144,542,6673,173,1852,665,226186,818231,353169,0481.

Potential milestone payments are associated with uncertainty as they are linked to successful achievements in research activities.Contractual obligationsThe lease commitments are related to IFRS 16 leases primarily for premises and company cars and include the present value of future lease payments during the lease term. Approximately 75% of the commitments are related to leases outside Denmark. Research and development obligations include contingent payments related to achieving development milestones. Such amounts entail uncertainties in relation to the period in which payments are due because a proportion of the obligations are dependent on milestone achievements. Exercise fees and subsequent milestone payments under in-licensing option agreements are excluded, as Novo Nordisk is not contractually obligated to make such payments. Commercial product launch milestones include contingent payments solely related to achievement of a commercial product launch following regulatory approval. Commercial milestones, royalties and other payments based on a percentage of sales generated from sale of goods following marketing approval are excluded from the contractual commitments analysis because of their contingent nature, related to future sales. The due periods disclosed are based on Management’s best estimate.The purchase obligations primarily relate to purchase agreements regarding medical equipment and consumer goods. Novo Nordisk expects to fund these commitments with existing cash and cash flow from operations.Other guaranteesOther guarantees amounts to DKK 1,117 million (DKK 906 million in 2019).

These non-IFRS financial measures may not be defined and calculated by other companies in the same manner, and may thus not be comparable.The non-IFRS financial measures presented in the Annual Report are:– Sales and operating profit in constant exchange rates– Operating profit after tax to net operating assets (OPAT/NOA)– Financial reserves– Free cash flow– Cash to earnings refers to an IFRS financial measure.Sales and operating profit growth in constant exchange rates'Growth in constant exchange rates’ means that the effect of changes in exchange rates is excluded. It is defined as sales/operating profit for the period measured at the average exchange rates for the same period of the prior year compared with net sales/operating profit for the same period of the prior year. Price adjustments within hyperinflation countries as defined in IAS 29 ‘Financial reporting in hyperinflation economies’ are excluded from the calculation to avoid growth in constant exchange rates being artificially inflated.Growth in constant exchange rates is considered to be relevant information for investors in order to understand the underlying development in sales and operating profit by adjusting for the impact of currency fluctuations.Sales in constant exchange ratesDKK million202020192018Net sales 126,946122,021111,831Effect of exchange rate3,254(3,923)5,043Sales in constant exchange rates130,200118,098116,874Net sales previous year122,021111,831111,696% increase/(decrease) in reported currencies4.0%9.1%0.1%% increase/(decrease) in constant exchange rates6.7%5.6%4.6%Operating profit in constant exchange ratesDKK million202020192018Operating profit 54,12652,48347,248Effect of exchange rate1,930(2,607)3,098Operating profit in constant exchange rates56,05649,87650,346Operating profit previous year52,48347,24848,967% increase/(decrease) in reported currencies3.1%11.1%(3.5%)% increase/(decrease) in constant exchange rates6.8%5.6%2.8%Operating profit after tax to net operating assets (OPAT/NOA)Operating profit after tax to net operating assets is defined as ‘operating profit after tax‘ (using the effective tax rate) as a percentage of average inventories, receivables, property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and deferred tax assets, less non-interest-bearing liabilities including provisions and deferred tax liabilities (where average is the sum of the above assets and liabilities at the beginning of the year and at year-end divided by two). Management believes operating profit after tax to net operating assets is a useful measure in providing investors and Management with information regarding the Group's performance. The calculation of this financial target is a widely accepted measure of earnings efficiency in relation to total capital employed.\fPart of Management´s review – not auditedNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  80The following table shows a reconciliation of free cash flow with net cash generated from operating activities, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure:Free cash flowDKK million202020192018Net cash generated from operating activities 51,95146,78244,616Net cash used in investing activities (22,436)(11,509)(12,080)Repayment on lease liabilities (950)(822)—Free cash flow28,56534,45132,536Cash to earningsCash to earnings is defined as 'free cash flow as a percentage of net profit'.Management believes that cash to earnings is an important performance metric because it measures the Group’s ability to turn earnings into cash.

Management believes that financial reserves at the end of the year are an important measure of the Group's financial strength from an investor's perspective, capturing the robustness of the Group's financial position and its financial preparedness for unforeseen developments.The following table reconciles total financial reserves with cash and cash equivalents, the most directly comparable IFRS financial measure:Financial reservesDKK million202020192018Cash and cash equivalents 12,22615,41115,629Undrawn committed credit facility11,53111,57811,574Undrawn bridge facility25,577——Borrowings2(576)(595)(506)Financial reserves228,75826,39426,6972. Financial reserves include amounts undrawn under credit facilities and overdrafts where the repayment of such facilities or overdrafts is not contractually required within 12 months of the balance sheet date. Financial reserves include the DKK 5,577 million (EUR 750 million) undrawn portion of a bridge facility as the terms of the facility provide that the maturity can be extended, at the option of Novo Nordisk, through June 2022. In accordance with IFRS, the DKK 5,577 million (EUR 750 million) drawn portion of the bridge facility has nevertheless been classified as current debt as it is Management’s expectation that the facility will be repaid in 2021. Free cash flowNovo Nordisk used to define free cash flow as ‘net cash generated from operating activities’ less ‘net cash used in investing activities’.From 1 January 2019, Novo Nordisk has defined free cash flow as ’net cash generated from operating activities’, less ‘net cash used in investing activities’, less repayment on lease liabilities. The updated definition reflects the imple­mentation of IFRS 16, which accordingly has a neutral effect on free cash flow.Free cash flow is a measure of the amount of cash generated in the period which is available for the Board to allocate between Novo Nordisk's capital providers, through measures such as dividends, share repurchases and repayment of debt (excluding lease liability repayments) or for retaining in the business to fund future growth. \fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – ESG statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  81Statement of environmental, social and governance (ESG) performancefor the year ended 31 DecemberNote202020192018Environmental performanceResourcesEnergy consumption for operations (1,000 GJ)7.13,1912,9933,099Share of renewable power for production sites 7.1100%76%77%Water consumption for production sites (1,000 m3)7.23,3683,1493,101Emissions and wasteCO2 emissions from operations and transportation (1,000 tonnes)7.3170306278Waste from production sites (1,000 tonnes)7.4141124142Social performancePatientsPatients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products (estimate in millions)8.132.830.029.2  – Hereof reached via the Novo Nordisk Access to Insulin Commitment (estimate in millions)8.13.22.90.3Children reached through the Changing Diabetes in Children programme (CDiC) (cumulative)8.128,29625,69522,876Donations and other contributions (DKK million)8.2158105103EmployeesEmployees (total)8.345,32343,25843,202Employee turnover8.37.9%11.4%11.7%Employee engagement18.3N/A91%91%Frequency of occupational accidents (number per million working hours)8.41.32.22.4OtherAnimals purchased for research8.550,03649,63765,593Gender in management (ratio men:women)8.659:4160:4060:40Gender in BoD (ratio men:women)8.662:3862:3867:33Governance performanceRelevant employees trained in business ethics9.199%99%99%Business ethics reviews9.1323433Facilitations of the Novo Nordisk Way (total)9.2263263Supplier audits9.3177236294Product recalls9.4—43Failed inspections9.5———Company trust (scale 0–100)9.680.678.284.5Total tax contribution (DKK million)9.726,37627,52725,825Breaches of environmental regulatory limit values9.81516271.

Sections 99a, 99b and 107d specify the requirements of the EU Directive on disclosure of non-financial and diversity information to report on the management of risks related to the environment, climate, human rights, labour and social conditions, anti-corruption and gender distribution. These requirements are addressed in the Management Review. Novo Nordisk also adheres to the International Integrated Reporting Framework and the AA1000AP(2018), which states that reporting must provide a complete, accurate, relevant and balanced picture of the organisation’s approach to and impact on stakeholders and society.Novo Nordisk is an active member of the world's leading circular economy network, the Ellen MacArthur Foundation.As recommended by the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD), Novo Nordisk is working to integrate two climate change scenarios into the risk management process to identify short, medium and long-term risks within our production and supply chain: – 2⁰C scenario, consistent with meeting the Paris Agreement Goal (Representative Concentration Pathway RCP 2.6)– 4⁰C scenario as an alternative high-emission scenario (RCP 8.5)Novo Nordisk discloses in accordance with the recommendations put forward by the Carbon Disclosure Project (CDP). For a full breakdown of climate and water impacts, please refer to the publicly available report of Novo Nordisk CDP disclosures. Novo Nordisk applies AA1000AP(2018) as a component in creating a generally applicable approach to assessing and strengthening the credibility of the Group's public reporting of ESG information. Novo Nordisk has designed processes to ensure that the qualitative and quantitative information that documents the ESG dimensions of performance is assured, as well as the systems that underpin the data and performance. The principles outlined in AA1000AP(2018) have been applied as described below.InclusivityAs a pharmaceutical business with global reach, Novo Nordisk is committed to being accountable to those stakeholders who are impacted by the organisation. From the perspective of social responsibility, the key stakeholder groups are patients who rely on Novo Nordisk products, employees at Novo Nordisk and throughout the Group's value chain, business partners and local communities. Novo Nordisk maps its stakeholders and has processes in place to ensure inclusion of stakeholder concerns and expectations. In addition, Novo Nordisk continuously develops its stakeholder engagement and capacity to be a sustainable business at corporate, regional and affiliate levels. See how Novo Nordisk defines what is meant by sustainable business in 'Purpose & sustainability'.MaterialityKey issues are identified through ongoing stakeholder engagement and trendspotting, informed by data-driven analysis and addressed by programmes or action plans with clear and measurable targets. The issues presented in the Annual Report are deemed to have a significant impact on the Group's future business performance and may support stakeholders in their decision-making.ResponsivenessThe Annual Report reflects how the company is managing operations in ways that consider and respond to stakeholder concerns and interests. The report reaches out to a wide range of stakeholders, each with specific needs and interests. The Annual Report is prepared with investors in mind. To these stakeholders, however, as well as to the many other groups who may seek information in the Annual Report, this is just one element of interaction and communication with the company.ImpactUnderstanding, measuring and communicating the positive and negative impacts on society and the environment of Novo Nordisk's activities are important. Novo Nordisk is currently working on developing methodologies to be better able to do just that, covering the entire value chain.Applying materialityThe consolidated ESG statement is a result of assessing legal requirements and disclosure commitments applicable to Novo Nordisk. Whether information is tied directly or indirectly to Novo Nordisk's ability to create value over the short, medium and long term is also assessed. When assessing whether a disclosure is material to include in the consolidated ESG statement, Management considers whether the matter is of such relevance and importance that it could substantively influence the assessment by providers of financial capital of Novo Nordisk's ability to create value over the short, medium and long term. See more at novonordisk.com. Principles of consolidationThe environmental disclosures covers the production sites, laboratories and offices with significant activities. CO2 emissions related to transportation cover cars leased or owned by Novo Nordisk, business flights and suppliers distributing Novo Nordisk products.The social and governance-related disclosures cover the Novo Nordisk Group, comprising Novo Nordisk A/S and entities controlled by Novo Nordisk A/S.Accounting policiesThe accounting policies set out below in the notes have been applied consistently in the preparation of the consolidated ESG statement for all the years presented.Changes to accounting policies and disclosuresChildren reached through the Changing Diabetes in Children programme (CDiC) has been added to expand disclosure to align with the Defeat Diabetes strategy.Gender in the Board of Directors (BoD) (ratio men:women) has been added to expand on the diversity reporting.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – ESG statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  837.3 CO2 emissions from operations and transportationCO2 emissions from operations and transportation1,000 tonnes202020192018Production378686Office buildings and laboratories81328Product distribution618039Business flights196563Company cars456262Total CO2 emissions170306278Novo Nordisk has a long-term target of zero CO2 emissions from operations and transportation by 2030. In 2020, CO2 emissions from operations and transportation decreased by 44%. The decrease was due to the implementation of renewable energy initiatives in production, as well as impacts from COVID-19 on transportation.CO2 emissions from production decreased by 57% due to the implementation of renewable heat and steam in Kalundborg, Denmark, wind power in France, Algeria and Russia, and solar power in the US.  7.1 Energy consumption for operations and share of renewable powerEnergy consumption for operations1,000 GJ202020192018Production2,7182,4582,502Office buildings and laboratories473535597Total energy consumption3,1912,9933,099Energy consumption for production increased by 11% primarily due to a new API production facility in Clayton, North Carolina. Energy consumption in office buildings and laboratories decreased by 12% due to both energy- saving projects and COVID-19 shutdowns. Energy-saving projects implemented in 2020 within production sites are expected to result in annual savings of 94,000 GJ.In 2020, 100% of power sourced at production sites was from renewable energy, an increase from 76% in 2019. This is due to five production sites, including North America, Russia and France, now also sourcing renewable power starting in 2020.Accounting policiesEnergy consumption for operations is measured as consumption of power, steam, heat and fuel. The fuel is mainly from natural gas, biogas and wood. Energy consumption is based on meter readings and invoices and covers all energy types at production sites and laboratories and consumption of power at office buildings outside of production sites. The share of renewable power used at production sites is reported according to the Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Protocol Scope 2 Guideline. It is calculated as the sum of power in each country that comes from 100% renewable sources, either sourced or self-produced.7.2 Water consumption for production sites In 2020, production sites consumed 3,368,000 cubic metres of water, an increase of 7% compared with 2019 due to the start-up of a new API production facility in Clayton, North Carolina. Four production sites, including China and Brazil, are in areas subject to water stress or high seasonal variations. They consume 11% of the total water for global production. Overall, water consumption at these facilities decreased by 15% in 2020, despite adding new sites. This was due to significant water-saving projects implemented in China and Brazil.Accounting policiesWater consumption is measured based on meter readings and invoices. It includes drinking water, industrial water and steam used at production sites.Section 7Environmental performanceCO2 emissions from global offices and laboratories decreased by 38% in 2020. As part of the Circular for Zero strategy, all offices and laboratories will source renewable power by 2030. In 2020, CO2 emissions from office buildings and laboratories decreased, primarily due to energy-saving projects and impacts from COVID-19.In 2020, emissions from product distribution decreased by 24%, primarily driven by optimisation projects to move products shipped from air to sea freight despite supply and market challenges.CO2 emissions from business flights decreased by 71%, and emissions from company cars decreased by 27%. This was due to impacts from COVID-19.A full breakdown of scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions from Novo Nordisk can be found at cdp.net.Accounting policiesCO2 emissions from operations (production, office buildings and laboratories)CO2 emissions from operations cover consumption of power, fuel, heat and steam at office buildings in Denmark, global production sites and laboratories, and consumption of power in office buildings outside Denmark. Emissions are measured in metric tonnes, calculated according to the GHG Protocol and based on emission factors from the previous year.CO2 emissions from product distributionCO2 emissions from product distribution are calculated by external transportation suppliers as the estimated emissions from product distribution in metric tonnes. CO2 emissions are calculated based on the worldwide distribution of semi-finished and finished products, raw materials and components by air, sea and road between production sites and from production sites to subsidiaries, direct customers and importing distributors. CO2 emissions from product distribution from subsidiaries to pharmacies, hospitals and wholesalers are not included.CO2 emissions from business flightsCO2 emissions from business flights are estimated based on mileage and emission factors for short, medium and long-haul flights along with passenger class obtained from travel agencies.CO2 emissions from company carsCO2 emissions from company cars cover cars leased or owned by Novo Nordisk. Emissions are calculated by multiplying emission factors by the volumes of diesel and petrol used.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – ESG statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  84Section 8Social performance8.1 Patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care productsThe estimated number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products increased from 30.0 million in 2019 to 32.8. million in 2020. This 9% increase was primarily driven by sales of long-acting, premix and fast-acting insulins, human insulin and GLP-1 products.In 2020, the estimated number of patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products via the Access to Insulin Commitment was 3.2 million, compared with 2.9 million in 2019. Novo Nordisk sold insulin according to this commitment in 34 countries of the 76 countries in scope. Beyond this scheme, Novo Nordisk also sold human insulin below the ceiling price in other countries, reaching an estimated additional 3.1 million patients in 2020. Approximately 130,000 patients were reached through human insulin vial donations to humanitarian organisations.Through the Changing Diabetes in Children programme, 28,296 children had been reached by the end of 2020, compared with 25,695 in 2019. Accounting policiesThe number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products, excluding devices and PrandiMet®, is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient for each product class as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO). PrandiMet® is not included as no WHO-defined dosage exists. WHO has not yet assigned a daily dose for Rybelsus®. For this calculation, it is assumed that one tablet equals one patient treatment day.The number of full-year patients reached with Novo Nordisk's Diabetes care products (human insulin in vials) via the Access to Insulin Commitment (AtIC) is estimated by dividing Novo Nordisk's annual sales volume by the annual usage dose per patient reached via the AtIC as defined by WHO. The WHO-defined daily dosage has not changed since 1982, except for Victoza® which was changed in 2019, and may not accurately reflect the recommended or prescribed daily dose. Actual doses are based on individual characteristics (e.g. age and weight) and pharmacokinetic considerations. Despite this uncertainty, Novo Nordisk assesses this to be the most consistent way of reporting.The number of children reached with free diabetes care treatment through the Changing Diabetes in Children programme is measured as the total accumulated number of children reached at the end of the year since 2009, when the programme was initiated.8.2 Donations and other contributionsDonations and other contributionsDKK million202020192018World Diabetes Foundation (WDF)1388685Novo Nordisk Haemophilia Foundation (NNHF)201918Total donations and other contributions158105103The WDF, an independent trust, supports sustainable partnerships and acts as a catalyst to help others do more.

Initiatives focus on capacity-building, diagnosis and registry, awareness and advocacy. Since 2005, the NNHF has provided funding for 296 programmes in 78 countries. See nnhf.org.Furthermore, DKK 165 million was granted to the Antimicrobial ResistanceResearch (AMR) Action Fund, the largest collective fund ever established to support vital research into antimicrobial resistance research and development. It is categorised as an equity investment and therefore not expensed in the income statement.Accounting policiesDonations and other contributions by Novo Nordisk to the WDF and the NNHF are recognised as an expense when the donation or contribution is paid out or when an unconditional commitment to donate has been made.7.4 Waste from production sitesWaste from production sites1,000 tonnes202020192018Organic residues11088993Other (paper, cardboard, metals, etc.)8812Total recycling 11697105Ethanol waste291322Other (various combustible waste)656Total waste with energy recovery3151828Water waste554Other434Total waste with no energy recovery4988Total waste to landfill111Total waste1411241421. Organic residues for recycling are waste from the production of the active pharmaceutical ingredients, where the energy is recovered in biogas plants and the digested slurry is used on local farmland as fertiliser.2. Ethanol is used in purification of Diabetes care and Biopharm products. The ethanol is recovered in internal regeneration plants and re-used many times. The ethanol waste reported here is from production with no regeneration or residues from the regeneration process.3. Energy recovery is waste disposed of at waste-to-energy plants and at a biogas plant.4. Water waste and other waste not suitable for other disposal methods, such as hazardous waste for incineration and various other types of waste.In 2020, waste from production sites increased by 14% compared with 2019. The amount of waste recycled increased by 20% in 2020 primarily due to an increase in production in Kalundborg, Denmark. The amount of waste sent for energy recovery decreased by 17% primarily due to a distillation method within API production to reuse ethanol  internally instead of sending it for incineration with energy recovery.In 2020, 93% of the total waste from production sites was recycled, used for biogas production or incinerated at plants where the energy is used for heat and power production. Less than 1% of total waste was sent to landfill.14% of the waste is categorised as hazardous waste, a decrease from 18% in 2019. This reduction was due to a reduction in ethanol waste from the production of API for Diabetes and Obesity care.Accounting policiesWaste is measured as the sum of all the waste disposed of at production sites based on weight receipts.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – ESG statement  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  858.5 Animals purchased for researchAnimals purchasedNumber202020192018Mice, rats and other rodents38,85048,08163,547Pigs7838801,023Rabbits239349641Dogs91157100Non-human primates264168278Fish (larvae)9,804——Other vertebrates524Total animals purchased50,03649,63765,593The number of animals purchased for research in 2020 increased by 1% compared with 2019 due to the purchase of fish. The overall development  reflects the changes in stages of the different research projects. However, for 2020 the animals purchased for research are also impacted by the overall COVID-19 situation. The reduction in the number of rodents purchased also reflects Novo Nordisk's continuous focus on reducing the number of animals per research project. 78% of the animals purchased were rodents.8.4 Frequency of occupational accidentsThe average frequency rate of occupational accidents with absence was 1.3 accidents per million working hours in 2020, compared with 2.2 in 2019, due to a 39% decrease in the number of accidents. In 2020, as in 2019, Novo Nordisk had one work-related fatality. The significant decrease in the number of occupational accidents is attributed to the global COVID-19-related lockdown. Our production sites, which have remained in operation during the lockdown, also show a decline in the number of occupational accidents with absence. Novo Nordisk works with a zero-injury mindset and has a long-term commitment to continuously improving safety performance.Accounting policiesThe frequency of occupational accidents with absence is measured as the internally reported number of accidents using full-time employees, excluding externals, employees on unpaid leave, interns, bachelor and master thesis employees and substitutes, per million nominal working hours. An occupational accident with absence is any work-related accident causing at least one day of absence in addition to the day of the accident.8.6 Gender diversityGender in managementRatio men:women202020192018EVP, SVP76:2482:1887:13CVP, VP, GM64:3666:3466:34Director, Manager, Team Leader58:4259:4160:40Gender in management (overall)59:4160:4060:40Gender in BoD62:3862:3867:33All management teams, from entry level upwards, are encouraged to focus on enhanced diversity, with the aim of ensuring a robust pipeline of talent for management positions.

Our responsibilities under those standards and requirements are further described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.IndependenceWe are independent of the Group in accordance with the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants (IESBA Code) and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark. We have also fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with the IESBA Code.To the best of our knowledge and belief, prohibited non-audit services referred to in Article 5(1) of Regulation (EU) No 537/2014 were not provided.Appointment We were first appointed auditors of Novo Nordisk A/S in April 1982 for the financial year 1982. We have been reappointed annually by shareholder resolution for a total period of uninterrupted engagement of 39 years including the financial year 2020.Key audit mattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the Financial Statements for 2020. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the Financial Statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.Key audit matterHow our audit addressed the key audit matterRevenue recognition relating to rebates and discounts in the US businessThe Group sells to various customers in the US, which can fall under certain commercial and government mandated contracts and reimbursement arrangements, of which the most significant are Managed Care, Medicare, Medicaid and charge-backs to wholesalers.These arrangements result in deductions to gross sales in arriving at net sales and give rise to obligations for the Group to provide customers with rebates, discounts and allowances, which for unsettled amounts are recognised as an accrual.We focused on this area because rebates, discounts and allowances are complex and because establishing an appropriate accrual requires significant judgement and estimation by Management. This judgement is particularly complex in a US healthcare environment in which competitive pricing pressure and product discounting are growing trends. Refer to Note 2.1 and Note 3.6.We obtained Management’s calculations for accruals under applicable schemes and assessed the significance of assumptions applied by comparing them to the stated commercial policies, the terms of the applicable contracts, third party data and historical levels of paid rebates and discounts in the US business.  We compared the assumptions to contracted prices, historical rebates, discounts, allowances and to current payment trends. We also considered the historical accuracy of the Group’s estimates.   We formed an independent assessment of the most significant elements of the accrual at 31 December 2020 using third party data and compared this expectation to the actual accrual recognised.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – Independent Auditor’s Reports  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  90Hellerup, 3 February 2021PricewaterhouseCoopersStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR no 3377 1231Mogens Nørgaard MogensenState Authorised Public Accountant mne21404Mads MelgaardState Authorised Public Accountant mne34354Statement on Management’s ReviewManagement is responsible for Management’s Review, section ‘Managements review’.Our opinion on the Financial Statements does not cover Management’s Review, and we do not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.In connection with our audit of the Financial Statements, our responsibility is to read Management’s Review and, in doing so, consider whether Management’s Review is materially inconsistent with the Financial Statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.

We did not identify any material misstatement in Management’s Review.Management’s responsibilities for the Financial StatementsManagement is responsible for the preparation of consolidated financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board and in accordance with IFRS as endorsed by the EU and further requirements in the Danish Financial Statements Act and for the preparation of parent company financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the Danish Financial Statements Act, and for such internal control as Management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.In preparing the Financial Statements, Management is responsible for assessing the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless Management either intends to liquidate the Group or the Parent Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the Financial StatementsOur objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the Financial Statements as a whole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these Financial Statements.As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs and the additional requirements applicable in Denmark, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit. We also: – Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the Financial Statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.– Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s internal control.– Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosures made by Management.– Conclude on the appropriateness of Management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s and the Parent Company’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the Financial Statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Parent Company to cease to continue as a going concern.– Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the Financial Statements, including the disclosures, and whether the Financial Statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.– Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Group to express an opinion on the Consolidated Financial Statements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit of the Financial Statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.Report on compliance with the ESEF RegulationAs part of our audit of the Financial Statements we performed procedures to express an opinion on whether the Annual Report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 with the file name NOVO-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the Commission Delegated Regulation (EU) 2019/815 on the European Single Electronic Format (ESEF Regulation) which includes requirements related to the preparation of the Annual Report in XHTML format and iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements.Management is responsible for preparing an Annual Report that complies with the ESEF Regulation. This responsibility includes:– The preparation of the Annual Report in XHTML format;– The selection and application of appropriate iXBRL tags, including extensions to the ESEF taxonomy and the anchoring thereof to elements in the taxonomy, for all financial information required to be tagged using judgement where necessary;– Ensuring consistency between iXBRL tagged data and the Consolidated Financial Statements presented in human-readable format; and– For such internal control as Management determines necessary to enable the preparation of an Annual Report that is compliant with the ESEF Regulation.Our responsibility is to obtain reasonable assurance on whether the Annual Report is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation based on the evidence we have obtained, and to issue a report that includes our opinion. The nature, timing and extent of procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgement, including the assessment of the risks of material departures from the requirements set out in the ESEF Regulation, whether due to fraud or error. The procedures include:– Testing whether the Annual Report is prepared in XHTML format;– Obtaining an understanding of the company’s iXBRL tagging process and of internal control over the tagging process;– Evaluating the completeness of the iXBRL tagging of the Consolidated Financial Statements;– Evaluating the appropriateness of the company’s use of iXBRL elements selected from the ESEF taxonomy and the creation of extension elements where no suitable element in the ESEF taxonomy has been identified;     – Evaluating the use of anchoring of extension elements to elements in the ESEF taxonomy; and– Reconciling the iXBRL tagged data with the audited Consolidated Financial Statements.In our opinion, the Annual Report of Novo Nordisk A/S for the financial year 1 January to 31 December 2020 with the file name NOVO-2020-12-31.zip is prepared, in all material respects, in compliance with the ESEF Regulation.\fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements – ESG Assurance Report  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  91Hellerup, 3 February 2021PricewaterhouseCoopersStatsautoriseret Revisionspartnerselskab CVR no 3377 1231Mogens Nørgaard MogensenState Authorised Public Accountant mne21404Mads MelgaardState Authorised Public Accountant mne34354Independent Assurance Report on the ESG statementTo the Stakeholders of Novo Nordisk A/SNovo Nordisk A/S engaged us to provide limited assurance on the Consolidated ESG statement stated in the Annual Report of Novo Nordisk for the year ended 31 December 2020.Our conclusionBased on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained:A. nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the Consolidated ESG statement of Novo Nordisk’s Annual Report for the year ended 31 December 2020 has not been prepared, in all material respects, in accordance with the Reporting Criteria; andB. nothing has come to our attention that causes us to believe that the description of Novo Nordisk’s alignment with the AA1000 Accountability Principles (AA1000AP) (2018) of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact is not fairly stated.This conclusion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of our report. What we are assuring The scope of our work was limited to assurance over:A. the Consolidated ESG statement and associated notes on pages 81 - 87 in the Annual Report of Novo Nordisk;B. Novo Nordisk’s description of alignment with the AA1000AP principles of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact for the year ended 31 December 2020 which is set out on page 82 (the stakeholder engagement description) of the Annual Report.Professional standards applied and level of assuranceWe performed a limited assurance engagement in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3000 (Revised) ‘Assurance Engagements other than Audits and Reviews of Historical Financial Information’ and, in respect of the greenhouse gas emissions stated on pages 81 and 83 in accordance with International Standard on Assurance Engagements 3410 ‘Assurance engagements on greenhouse gas statements’ and AA1000 Assurance Standard (AA1000AS, 2008) with 2018 Addendum (Type 2, moderate, which is the equivalent to ISAE 3000 limited assurance). A limited assurance engagement is substantially less in scope than a reasonable assurance engagement in relation to both the risk assessment procedures, including an understanding of internal control, and the procedures performed in response to the assessed risks; consequently, the level of assurance obtained in a limited assurance engagement is substantially lower than the assurance that would have been obtained had a reasonable assurance engagement been performed.Our independence and quality controlWe have complied with the Code of Ethics for Professional Accountants issued by the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants, which includes independence and other ethical requirements founded on fundamental principles of integrity, objectivity, professional competence and due care, confidentiality and professional behaviour. We also qualify as independent as defined by the AA1000AS. The firm applies International Standard on Quality Control 1 and accordingly maintains a comprehensive system of quality control including documented policies and procedures regarding compliance with ethical requirements, professional standards and applicable legal and regulatory requirements. Our work was carried out by an independent multidisciplinary team with experience in sustainability reporting and assurance.Understanding reporting and measurement methodologiesThe Consolidated ESG statement needs to be read and understood together with the Reporting Criteria (pages 82 - 87), which Novo Nordisk A/S is solely responsible for selecting and applying. The absence of a significant body of established practice on which to draw to evaluate and measure non-financial information allows for different, but acceptable, measurement techniques and can affect comparability between entities and over time. Work performedA. We are required to plan and perform our work in order to consider the risk of material misstatement of the Consolidated ESG statement. In doing so, we:– conducted interviews to understand the key processes and control activities for reporting data;– obtained an understanding of the key processes and controls for managing, recording and reporting;– performed limited substantive testing on a selective basis to check that data had been appropriately measured, recorded, collated and reported;– performed analysis of data selected on the basis of risk and materiality to the group;– made inquiries to significant development in reported data;– considered the presentation and disclosure of the Consolidated ESG statement; and – assessed that the process for reporting greenhouse gas emissions data comply with the principles of relevance, completeness, consistency, transparency and accuracy outlined in the greenhouse gas protocol (2003).B. In respect of Novo Nordisk’s description of alignment with the AA1000AP of Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact we performed the following activities:– interviewed members of Novo Nordisk’s Board of Directors and Executive Management team, representatives responsible for Corporate and Commercial Strategy at global level and within International Operations, key employees in Global Public Affairs and Sustainability to determine their understanding of Novo Nordisk’s stakeholders, the mechanisms used to engage them and key issues that are of interest to each stakeholder group;– interviewed external stakeholders to determine their perception of Novo Nordisk’s stakeholder engagement capabilities, particularly, in relation to understanding and responding to material concerns, needs and desires linked to access and affordability regarding medicin and Circular for Zero;– reviewed evidence on a selective basis to support the assertions made in these interviews and in the stakeholder engagement description;– confirmed the systems and procedures to support Novo Nordisk’s governance for responsible business conduct and stakeholder relationships. Our work focused on how Novo Nordisk intends to deliver on the Atrategic Aspiration of Purpose and sustainability and to what extend it is aligned with stakeholder needs and concerns and Novo Nordisk’s aim of being a truly sustainable company; and– assessed the disclosure and presentation of the stakeholder engagement description.Novo Nordisk’s responsibilitiesManagement are responsible for:– designing, implementing and maintaining internal controls over information relevant to the preparation of the Consolidated ESG statement that is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error; – establishing objective Reporting Criteria for preparing the Consolidated ESG statement;– preparing the greenhouse gas protocol statement in accordance with the defined Reporting Criteria. Greenhouse gas quantification is subject to inherent uncertainty because of incomplete scientific knowledge used to determine emissions factors and the values needed to combine emissions of different gases;– measuring and reporting the Consolidated ESG statement based on the Reporting Criteria; and– the content of the Annual Report 2020.Our responsibilityWe are responsible for:– planning and performing the engagement to obtain limited assurance about whether the Consolidated ESG statement is free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error;– forming an independent conclusion, based on the procedures we performed and the evidence we obtained; and– reporting our conclusion to the Stakeholders of Novo Nordisk A/S.Observations and recommendationsAccording to AA1000AS, we are required to include observations and recommendations for improvements in relation to adherence to the AA1000AP. We have no significant recommendations regarding Inclusivity, Materiality, Responsiveness and Impact. We have communicated a number of minor recommendations for improvement to the Management. \fIntroducing Novo Nordisk  /  Strategic Aspirations  /  Corporate governance  /  Consolidated statements  /  Additional informationNovo Nordisk Annual Report 2020  /  92More informationAdditional reportingNovo Nordisk provides additional disclosure to satisfy legal requirements and stakeholder interests.

The accounting policies for the financial statements of the parent company are unchanged from the previous financial year except for a change of presentation of equity. The accounting policies are the same as for the consolidated financial statements with the adjustments described below. For a description of the accounting policies of the Group, please refer to the consolidated financial statements.No separate statement of cash flows has been prepared for the parent company; please refer to the statement of cash flows for the Group.Change of presentation of equityThe Danish Financial Statements Act has been amended effective from 1January 2020 to require an equity reserve corresponding to income andexpenses on cash flow hedges recognised in equity ('Reserve for cash flowhedges'). These transactions have previously been recognised in retained earnings. The reserve for cash flow hedges is distributable.The amendment has been implemented retrospectively. The impact at thebeginning of 2019 is recognition of a reserve for cash flow hedges amounting to DKK (1,506) million and a corresponding increase in retained earnings. The implementation had no impact on total equity.

A few observers tooknote of the peculiar move, but thewhole episode quickly faded amidthe frenzy of the coronavirus pan-demic.What is now clear is that thestudy was not removed because offaulty research. Instead, it waswithdrawn at the direction of Chi-nese health officials amid a crack-down on science. That effortkicked up a cloud of dust aroundthe dates of early Covid cases, likethose reported in the study.“It was so hard to get any infor-mation out of China,” said one ofthe authors, Ira Longini, of theUniversity of Florida, who de-scribed the back story of the re-moval publicly for the first time ina recent interview. “There was somuch covered up, and so muchhidden.”That the Chinese governmentmuzzled scientists, hindered in-ternational investigations andcensored online discussion of thepandemic is well documented. ButBeijing’s stranglehold on informa-tion goes far deeper than evenmany pandemic researchers areaware of. Its censorship campaignhas targeted international jour-nals and scientific databases,shaking the foundations of sharedscientific knowledge, a New YorkTimes investigation found.Under pressure from their gov-ernment, Chinese scientists havewithheld data, withdrawn geneticsequences from public databasesand altered crucial details in jour-nal submissions. Western journaleditors enabled those efforts byagreeing to those edits or with-drawing papers for murky rea-sons, a review by The Times ofover a dozen retracted papersfound.Groups including the WorldHealth Organization have givencredence to muddled data and in-accurate timelines.This scientific censorship hasnot universally succeeded: Theoriginal version of the February2020 paper, for example, can stillbe found online with some dig-ging.

Speaking on the condi-tion of anonymity, U.S. govern-ment officials told The New YorkTimes last week that they hadbeen tracking the Wyoming oper-ation for months. One official saidthat measures had been taken tomitigate potential intelligence col-lection but declined to elaborate.In addition, the mining companysaid it responded to queries fromthe federal investment commit-tee.The national security concernsabout the Wyoming site, previ-ously unreported, reflect abroader unease about a recentsurge in Chinese Bitcoin minesacross the country.Aside from intelligence-gather-ing worries, the mines, which arelarge warehouses or containerspacked with specialized comput-ers, put immense pressure onpower grids.

She was 80.Her death was confirmed byJonathan Galassi, her editor atFarrar, Straus & Giroux, The As-sociated Press said.

A U.N.spokesman, Stéphane Dujarric,said in a statement that the evacu-ation could not be conducted“without devastating humanitar-ian consequences,” and “couldtransform what is already a trage-dy into a calamitous situation.”The Israeli military did not backaway from the evacuation plan onFriday but softened its stance,suggesting there was no deadline,after initially saying that peopleshould leave northern Gazawithin 24 hours. “We understandit will take time,” Rear Adm. Dan-iel Hagari, the chief militaryspokesman, told reporters.In Gaza, already cut off from vi-tal supplies, many people fledwith what they could carry, notknowing what conditions awaitedthem in the south or how long theywould be gone. But many othersremained, out of necessity, fear ordefiance.

Since the brutalterror attacks on Israelis last Sat-urday, many New York Jews saidthey have put aside those differ-ences.This week, thousands of Jewsfrom across the political and theo-logical spectrum gathered outsidethe United Nations, manywrapped in blue and white Israeliflags, coming together both togrieve and to condemn the as-sault.It was a show of unity thatwould have been hard to imaginepreviously, said Eric Goldstein,chief executive of UJA-Federationof New York. “To a large degreethe Jewish community has cometogether in this moment.”New York City has long haduniquely close emotional bondswith Israel, which strengthen intimes of crisis — a relationshipforged through the atrocities inEurope that led to the country’sfounding and created much ofNew York’s Jewish community.Jewish New Yorkers have lookedat Israel as an emblem of homeand survival in a hostile world.Tens of thousands of New York-ers have relatives in Israel, Mr.Goldstein said.

To My Fellow Shareholders: When I wrote to you one year ago, it was still early days for the COVID-19 pandemic that has since resulted in more than 120 million infections and 2.6 million deaths worldwide. Indeed, 2020 proved to be a year like no other, with worldwide economic disruption and social turmoil caused by the greatest public health crisis in more than a century. While the end of the pandemic may not yet be near, we should feel confdent today that we at least have reached the beginning of the end. Incredible feats of biotechnology have made that possible in a remarkably brief period of time. A belief in the potential of biotechnology inspired Amgen’s founders to create our company more than 40 years ago. We are even more convinced today about the potential for biotechnology to make a positive difference in the world than they were then. Under very trying circumstances, Amgen fulflled many important objectives over the past year. With so many families and companies struggling with the effects of the pandemic, this is not a time to celebrate our performance. Nonetheless, RESPONDING TO COVID-19 I want to acknowledge the resilience of our staff and their dedication to our mission to serve patients. We were strong heading into the pandemic and, Foremost among these is the health and thanks to them, we expect to emerge safety of our employees around thefrom it even stronger. world. Roughly three-quarters of our staff Throughout 2020, and still today, we have kept our focus on a few priorities. Amgen employees Petra Björkander (left) and Mikael Hansson (right) volunteered to help care for severely ill COVID-19 patients at their local hospitals in Sweden, where the pandemic hit particularly hard. “The experience reinforced for me the importance of what we at Amgen do every day,” Petra says. “Regardless of the role we perform, all of us are helping to serve patients.” 2 \f2020 Letter to Shareholders  |  Amgen    $25.4B$16.60 $4.2B 50.9% 2020 Total Revenues Non-GAAP Research and Development Non-GAAP Earnings Per Share1 Investment Operating Margin1 1This is a non-GAAP fnancial measure.

We have also offered paid leave to medically-trained staff members who wish to volunteer full time to assist in COVID-19 relief efforts. In a poll of our staff, more than 90% of our people responded that they are satisfed with how the company has been supporting them during this challenging time. By keeping our people safe, we have enabled them to provide an uninterrupted supply of our medicines to patients around the world. While the pandemic adopted new digital technologies that has consumed much of the world’s have enabled us to stay connected attention, we know that millions of people with the physicians prescribing our continue to have other devastating health medicines and the patients using them. events like heart attacks, migraines, and We are also contributing our scientifc bone fractures that our medicines can and manufacturing expertise directly help prevent.

A $100,000 grant from the Amgen Foundation in 2020 enabled the organization to meet a pandemic-driven surge in demand for its “Meals on Wheels” program that brings food to seniors’ homes. According to Senior Concerns President Andrea Gallagher, “Amgen’s support helps ensure we can meet the needs of our elders during this time of crisis. It means the world to us.” 3 \f2020 Letter to Shareholders  |  Amgen$6.40 2011* 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016 2017 2018 2019 2020 *Represents annualized dividend after September 2011 initiation.

Drug Administration (FDA) for treating patients with mild-to-moderate COVID-19 who are at high risk for progressing to severe COVID-19 and/or hospitalization. Finally, Amgen is contributing to the health of the communities where we live and work. In March 2020, Amgen and the Amgen Foundation pledged $12.5 million to support COVID-19 relief efforts around the world. Some of these funds have gone to nonproft organizations like Direct Relief that do their work on a global scale. The vast majority of our donations, however, have been made at the local level—to food banks, ambulance squads, and senior care facilities. Additionally, the Amgen Foundation has been working to extend the impact of two virtual science education platforms, Khan Academy and LabXchange. These platforms— free to everyone—have become increasingly important for the millions of children staying home from school. LabXchange, for example, was launched in January 2020 and has already reached six million users interested in conducting virtual lab experiments.

I told you a year ago that we expected revenue growth in 2020. Despite an incredibly challenging and unpredictable year, total revenues increased 9% to a record $25.4 billion, driven by a number of factors: • We delivered year-over-year, double-digit growth for many of our newer innovative medicines, including our cholesterol treatment Repatha® (+34%), our migraine therapy Aimovig® (+24%), and our osteoporosis medicine EVENITY® (+85%). We have been able to generate this strong growth overall through volume gains, rather than price increases—important in light of intense budget pressures facing healthcare systems around the world. • We successfully integrated Otezla®, strengthening our decades-long leadership in infammation. Acquired by Amgen in November 2019, Otezla® generated sales of $2.2 billion in 2020, and we believe it will be a strong growth driver for us in the coming years. 2 Reference to our website is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this letter. 4 \f2020 Letter to Shareholders  |  Amgen• We grew annual sales of our biosimilars to $1.7 billion. Four Amgen biosimilars are now available to patients around the world. The most recent addition to our portfolio is RIABNI™, approved in the U.S. in December 2020 as a biosimilar to the cancer medicine Rituxan®.3 We have an additional three biosimilars in Phase 3 development. • We increased our sales by 10% outside the U.S. to more than $6 billion, with our revenues in the Asia-Pacifc region exceeding $1 billion for the frst time. Our non-GAAP earnings per share rose 12% in 2020 to a record $16.60,4 with our non-GAAP operating margin increasing 0.7 percentage points to 50.9%,4 among the highest in our industry. Both of these measures refect that we are managing our business effciently and driving continuous productivity gains. Research and development investments are inherently long term. We invested $4.2 billion in research and development in 2020—and approximately $19 billion over the past fve years—to advance potential medicines at all stages of our pipeline and to strengthen our early research capabilities, which I will discuss below. Although total shareholder return declined a modest 2% in 2020, it has increased by 44%, 63%, and 425% over the past three, fve, and ten years, respectively, exceeding our peer group in each of these longer-term time periods. We returned in excess of $7 billion to shareholders in 2020 through dividends and share repurchases. As the chart on page 4 illustrates, we have increased our dividend nearly sixfold since 2011, with an additional 10% increase for the frst and second quarters of 2021 versus the same periods in 2020. FOCUSING ON 2021 AND BEYOND By any measure, 2020 was a very successful year for Amgen, and our ability to deliver in the most trying of circumstances gives us confdence for the future. The pandemic has made it clear that the world needs more innovation, not less, and we at Amgen are determined to provide it. We have more than 20 marketed medicines in our portfolio that treat some of the world’s most serious, widespread, and costly diseases. We believe that many of these products can beneft signifcantly more patients around the world than they do today. In 2020, for example, we fled for approval of our migraine prevention treatment Aimovig® in Japan, where eight million people live with this often incapacitating disease. This marked the frst regulatory fling for Amgen in Japan since we assumed full ownership of our long-standing collaboration with Astellas Pharma Inc. in April 2020. In China, our cancer medicines are reaching more patients thanks to a strategic collaboration initiated in January 2020 with BeiGene, Ltd., a leading cancer biotechnology company in that market. As part of our collaboration, we have invested $3.35 billion to establish an ownership stake in BeiGene of approximately 20%. Outside of this collaboration, Amgen in 2020 launched Prolia® in China, where one in three women over the age of 50 is affected by osteoporosis. Otezla® is another product with strong growth potential globally, having been launched in only about 40 of the 55 countries where it is approved. Additionally, in February 2021, we fled Otezla® for a new indication in the U.S., which would signifcantly expand China has more than 175 million people over the age of 65—more than any other country in the world. The launch of Prolia® there provides a new treatment option to the estimated 70 million postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. 3 Rituxan® is a registered trademark of Biogen. 4 This is a non-GAAP fnancial measure. See reconciliation to U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) accompanying this letter. 5 \f2020 Letter to Shareholders  |  Amgenthe number of patients who could potentially beneft from this medicine. Looking forward, we are especially excited about two potential new product candidates—sotorasib for non-small cell lung cancer and tezepelumab for severe asthma—both of which have received Breakthrough Therapy Designation from the FDA. Sotorasib represents the culmination of a 40-year quest to treat non-small cell lung cancer and other solid tumors harboring the KRASG12C mutation. This mutation is found in approximately 13% of patients with non-small cell lung cancer, which is the most common form of lung cancer. The KRASG12C protein was long considered an “undruggable” target. Amgen scientists were the frst to identify a previously hidden crevice on the surface of the KRASG12C protein. Our scientists then engineered a molecule—sotorasib— that could attach to the protein. We have moved sotorasib forward with unprecedented speed, fling it for approval in the U.S. and the European Union just 28 months after the frst patient was dosed in a Phase 1 clinical trial—making it among the fastest drug development programs in history. What’s especially remarkable is that during the last 10 of these 28 months, everyone involved with this program—Amgen staff, clinical trial investigators, and, of course, patients— had to deal with the complications presented by the pandemic. In the U.S., sotorasib has received Priority Review designation from the FDA and is being evaluated under the agency’s Real Time Oncology Review program, which aims to create a more effcient review process so that important new treatments are made available to patients as early as possible. Additionally, as of March 1, we have fled sotorasib for approval as a non-small cell lung cancer treatment in Australia, Brazil, Canada, and the UK. We are also studying sotorasib in combination with other cancer therapies and in other solid tumor types. We expect data from several of these studies to become available during 2021. Tezepelumab is our investigational medicine for severe asthma, a debilitating disease that affects millions of people worldwide. Unlike existing treatments, tezepelumab targets a protein that sits at the top of multiple infammatory cascades and is critical in the initiation and persistence of airway infammation associated with severe asthma. The prevalence of severe asthma is expected to grow over time as millions of people around the world move from rural to urban areas, where the air quality is typically poorer. We expect to submit tezepelumab for regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe in the frst half of this year. We are also exploring it as a potential treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Sotorasib and tezepelumab represent the very best of Amgen—potential frst­in-class medicines that treat serious diseases for which there are very few good options otherwise available for patients. We believe both have the potential to be important products for Amgen for many years to come. Behind our late-stage pipeline assets are several potential new medicines now in Phase 2 development for the treatment of atherosclerosis, systemic lupus erythematosus, and celiac disease. Lung cancer survivor and patient advocate Bonnie Addario is co-founder of the GO2 Foundation for Lung Cancer. “New therapies are coming rapidly,” she says. “I never thought I would say this, but this is a very exciting time for lung cancer patients.” 6 \f2020 Letter to Shareholders  |  AmgenAmong the many Amgen molecules in Phase 1 development, AMG 160 and AMG 757 have each shown encouraging early data suggesting effectiveness against prostate cancer and small cell lung cancer, respectively. Both are in a class of medicines known as bispecifc T-cell engagers, or BiTE® molecules, which are designed to engage a patient’s own immune cells to target and destroy tumor cells. In 2020, we advanced an additional eight investigational therapies into Phase 1 clinical studies—one more than in 2019, which is remarkable given the challenges of COVID-19. Seven of the eight represent “frsts,” either for Amgen or the entire industry. To keep our pipeline full of promising new treatments over the long term, we continue to invest in building a set of differentiated early research capabilities. In human genetics, for example, we are adding information from as many as one million volunteers in the U.S. and the UK. This will augment the data we already have on 1.5 million individuals from around the world, many of whom live in Iceland, home to deCODE Genetics. In what is shaping up to be the world’s largest proteomics experiment, we are measuring the relative levels of some 5,000 diffcult-to-detect proteins in the blood of 37,000 Icelanders who have cardiovascular disease and whose genomes have been sequenced. We are excited about the insights being generated from this groundbreaking work, which we expect will improve our ability to predict who is at risk for disease and to develop therapies to keep them healthy. Amgen is also pioneering new types of molecules that work through a principle we call “induced proximity.” I mentioned earlier that the KRASG12C protein found in many patients with non-small cell lung cancer was an elusive target for decades due to the diffculty of getting a drug to bind to its surface. This is a common problem, with an estimated 85% of human proteins falling into this “undruggable” category. To overcome this challenge, we are now developing drugs that can form connections between two or more proteins. Instead of operating on their own—as traditional medicines do—these drugs induce proximity between targeted proteins, clearing the way for powerful biological mechanisms to help get the job done. This opens up vast new possibilities to tackle diseases that currently have few, if any, good treatment options. To learn more about Amgen’s pipeline and the science behind it, please visit www.amgen.com/science.5 Professor Andrew Menzies-Gow is director of the Lung Division at the UK’s Royal Brompton Hospital. “Due to the complex nature of severe asthma, many patients continue to face debilitating asthma despite receiving standard-of-care inhaled medicines and currently approved biologics,” he says. “Tezepelumab has the potential to help severe asthma patients who are underserved today.” OPERATING WITH PURPOSE For several years now, businesses have faced increasing expectations of corporate responsibility, and I expect that the pandemic will only accelerate this trend. Our society confronts multiple challenges, and we are working to do our part to address them as effective corporate stewards. Here are just a few examples of what we are doing: • In January 2021, we announced ambitious new environmental goals, including a goal to achieve net zero carbon emissions (also known as “carbon neutrality”) by 2027, along with a 40% reduction in water used and a 75% reduction in waste disposed.6 These new targets build on the good progress we have made in these three areas since 2007, all coming even as we signifcantly expanded our business. 5 Reference to our website is not intended to function as a hyperlink, and the information contained on our website is not intended to be a part of this letter. 6 Represents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verifed reduction projects, and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the company. 7 \f2020 Letter to Shareholders  |  Amgen• We are building a more diverse and inclusive culture at Amgen—one in which all of our people feel they belong and can achieve their full potential. We surveyed our staff in 2020 and found that the vast majority believe they “work in an environment that is free from harassment and discrimination” and are “treated with respect and dignity.” While our scores are well above global benchmarks, we know we can do even better. To date, our employees in the U.S. and Canada have completed mandatory unconscious bias training, with the rest of the organization to follow this year. Our employee resource groups—which have always enjoyed strong support at Amgen— increased their membership by 75% collectively in 2020, and these groups increasingly meet together to discuss common areas of interest such as maintaining mental health and well-being during stressful times. • Our minority employees have told us heartbreaking stories about how they are marginalized—and often mistreated—in their personal lives. As a result, the Amgen Foundation, working in partnership with the Amgen Black Employee Network, donated $7.5 million last year to support organizations advancing social justice across the U.S. at the national and local levels. One of these organizations, Strive for College, connects high school students in fnancial need with free, one-on-one mentoring to help them navigate the college and fnancial aid application process. Eighty­fve percent of these students are minorities, and many will be the frst in their families to go to college. Dr. David Reese (left), our head of Research and Development and executive sponsor of the Amgen Black Employee Network, spoke with Amgen Vice President Mike Edmondson (right) about race relations in America—one in a series of video conversations that are helping our employees better appreciate the experiences of their diverse colleagues. • In December 2020, Amgen became a founding member of OneTen, a coalition of more than 40 of the world’s largest, best-known companies that aims collectively to hire one million Black Americans into good-paying jobs over the next ten years, with a specifc focus on those without a four-year college degree. Krutika Invally is a senior engineer at Amgen’s facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She also participates in the Strive for College program, virtually mentoring an 18-year-old high school student hoping to be the frst in his family to pursue a higher education. “It’s exciting to hear where Tomas wants to be,” she says. “And I’m excited to do what I can to help him get there.” 8 \f2020 Letter to Shareholders  |  Amgen• We recognize that people of color experience many diseases at higher rates than the general population, while having less access to healthcare and suffering poorer health outcomes. Amgen is working to address these health disparities, in part through efforts to increase the diversity of participants in our clinical trials, which will in turn help us better understand how our medicines will perform in a broad patient population. I want to acknowledge the Amgen Black Employee Network for its leadership on this important issue. Racquel Racadio works in Amgen’s research and development organization and wrote a white paper in her personal time highlighting the need for greater diversity in clinical trials. Her work has served as the foundation for a company-wide effort that got underway in 2020. “Our mission is to serve patients, and to do that genuinely means reducing barriers to participation in our clinical trials,” she says. “I’m encouraged by the progress we’re making.” • We recognize that many patients are unable to afford the medicines they need. In response, the Amgen Safety Net Foundation has provided approximately $6 billion7 of our medicines at no cost over the past fve years to qualifying patients.8 We are also committed to the responsible pricing of our medicines. In fact, 2020 marked the third year in a row in which the average net price of Amgen medicines declined.

Recent advances in science and technology are breathtaking—and accelerating. Amgen is at the forefront of these advances, increasing our ability to tackle serious illnesses and help millions of people around the world live longer, healthier lives. On behalf of Amgen’s board of directors, our senior leadership team, and our employees around the world, I thank you for your continued support of our company and the important work we do. Robert A.

Unless otherwise noted, Amgen is providing this information as of the date of this communication and does not undertake any obligation to update any forward-looking statements contained in this document as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. No forward-looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may differ materially from those we project. Our results may be affected by our ability to successfully market both new and existing products domestically and internationally, clinical and regulatory developments involving current and future products, sales growth of recently launched products, competition from other products including biosimilars, diffculties or delays in manufacturing our products and global economic conditions. In addition, sales of our products are affected by pricing pressure, political and public scrutiny and reimbursement policies imposed by third-party payers, including governments, private insurance plans and managed care providers and may be affected by regulatory, clinical and guideline developments and domestic and international trends toward managed care and healthcare cost containment. Furthermore, our research, testing, pricing, marketing and other operations are subject to extensive regulation by domestic and foreign government regulatory authorities. We or others could identify safety, side effects or manufacturing problems with our products, including our devices, after they are on the market. Our business may be impacted by government investigations, litigation and product liability claims. In addition, our business may be impacted by the adoption of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities. If we fail to meet the compliance obligations in the corporate integrity agreement between us and the U.S. government, we could become subject to signifcant sanctions. Further, while we routinely obtain patents for our products and technology, the protection offered by our patents and patent applications may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented by our competitors, or we may fail to prevail in present and future intellectual property litigation. We perform a substantial amount of our commercial manufacturing activities at a few key facilities, including in Puerto Rico, and also depend on third parties for a portion of our manufacturing activities, and limits on supply may constrain sales of certain of our current products and product candidate development. An outbreak of disease or similar public health threat, such as COVID-19, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of such disease, could have a signifcant adverse effect on the supply of materials for our manufacturing activities, the distribution of our products, the commercialization of our product candidates, and our clinical trial operations, and any such events may have a material adverse effect on our product development, product sales, business and results of operations. We rely on collaborations with third parties for the development of some of our product candidates and for the commercialization and sales of some of our commercial products. In addition, we compete with other companies with respect to many of our marketed products as well as for the discovery and development of new products. Discovery or identifcation of new product candidates or development of new indications for existing products cannot be guaranteed and movement from concept to product is uncertain; consequently, there can be no guarantee that any particular product candidate or development of a new indication for an existing product will be successful and become a commercial product. Further, some raw materials, medical devices and component parts for our products are supplied by sole third-party suppliers. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage in their dealings with us. The discovery of signifcant problems with a product similar to one of our products that implicate an entire class of products could have a material adverse effect on sales of the affected products and on our business and results of operations. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confdentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and our data. Our stock price is volatile and may be affected by a number of events. Global economic conditions may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our business performance could affect or limit the ability of our Board of Directors to declare a dividend or our ability to pay a dividend or repurchase our common stock. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 11 \f\f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            UNITED STATES SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION Washington, D.C. 20549 Form 10-K (Mark One) ☒ ANNUAL REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THESECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 For the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 or ☐ TRANSITION REPORT PURSUANT TO SECTION 13 OR 15(d) OF THESECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 Commission file number 001-37702 Amgen Inc.

Significant Developments Following is a summary of significant developments affecting our business that have occurred and that we have reported since the filing of our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2019. COVID-19 pandemic A novel strain of coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2, or severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2, causing coronavirus disease 19, or COVID-19) was declared a global pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO) on March 11, 2020. Since the first quarter of 2020 and continuing into 2021, we have seen some impact of the pandemic to our operations. We continue to monitor and respond as the pandemic evolves to ensure the continued development, manufacture and distribution of our medicines. For further discussion, see Item 7. Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Overview, Selected Financial Information and Results of Operations. For a discussion of the risks presented by the COVID-19 pandemic to our results, see Risk Factors in Item 1A. Also see the remainder of Item 1. Business for discussion of pandemic-related impacts to our overall business. Products/Pipeline Oncology/Hematology KYPROLIS® (carfilzomib) • In August 2020, we announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) had approved the expansion of the KYPROLIS® U.S. prescribing information to include its use in combination with DARZALEX® (daratumumab) plus dexamethasone in two dosing regimens—once weekly and twice weekly—for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three previous lines of therapy. Sotorasib (formerly AMG 510) • In September 2020, we announced updated phase 1 data evaluating sotorasib in 129 patients across multiple advanced solid tumors with Kirsten rat sarcoma viral oncogene homolog (KRAS) G12C mutation, which were published in the New England Journal of Medicine. Data from 59 patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) were also featured in an oral presentation at a September 2020 medical conference. In the patients with advanced NSCLC who were treated with the 960 mg daily dose, the confirmed objective response rate (ORR) was 35.3%. Across all dose levels, the confirmed ORR was 32.2%, with median duration of response of 10.9 months and median progression-free survival (PFS) of 6.3 months; 10 of 19 responders were still in response as of the data cutoff. • In October 2020, we announced top-line phase 2 results in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC. Sotorasib demonstrated an ORR (primary endpoint) consistent with previously reported phase 1 data in patients taking the 960 mg daily dose. Other measures of efficacy, including duration of response, were promising, and more than half of the responders were still on treatment and continuing to respond as of the data cutoff date. The results of this phase 2 study are potentially registrational, and a phase 3 confirmatory study comparing sotorasib to docetaxel is currently recruiting patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC. 1 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    • In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for our investigational KRASG12C inhibitor, sotorasib, for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation, as determined by an FDA-approved test, following at least one prior systemic therapy. Following this announcement, we submitted a New Drug Application (NDA) to the FDA. The sotorasib NDA is being reviewed by the FDA’s Real-Time Oncology Review (RTOR) pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible. Later in December, we also submitted a Marketing Authorization Application (MAA) to the European Medicines Agency (EMA). • In January 2021, we announced results from the phase 2 cohort of the clinical study evaluating sotorasib in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC. Sotorasib demonstrated a confirmed ORR and disease control rate of 37.1% and 80.6%, respectively, a median duration of response of 10 months and median progression-free survival of 6.8 months. In addition, sotorasib was granted Breakthrough Therapy designation by the Center for Drug Evaluation of the National Medical Products Administration in China. RIABNITM (rituximab-arrx) (formerly ABP 798) • In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had approved RIABNITM, a biosimilar to Rituxan® (rituximab), for the treatment of adult patients with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukemia, granulomatosis with polyangiitis (Wegener’s granulomatosis) and microscopic polyangiitis. RIABNITM launched in the United States in January 2021. Inflammation Otezla® (apremilast) • In May 2020, we announced positive top-line results from a phase 3 study to assess the efficacy of Otezla® in adults with mild-to-moderate plaque psoriasis. The study showed that oral Otezla® 30 mg twice daily achieved a statistically significant improvement, compared with placebo, in the primary endpoint of the static Physician’s Global Assessment (sPGA) response (defined as an sPGA score of clear (0) or almost clear (1) with at least a 2-point reduction from baseline) at week 16. Enbrel® (etanercept) • In July 2020, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed the judgment by the U.S. District Court for the District of New Jersey upholding the validity of the two patents that describe and claim ENBREL and methods for making it.

Tezepelumab • In November 2020, we and AstraZeneca plc (AstraZeneca) announced positive top-line results from the registrational phase 3 NAVIGATOR trial in adults and adolescents with severe uncontrolled asthma. The trial met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to standard of care (SoC), demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction compared with placebo plus SoC in the annualized asthma exacerbation rate (AAER) over 52 weeks in the overall patient population. SoC consisted of medium- or high-dose inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) plus at least one additional controller medication with or without oral corticosteroids (OCS). We expect to submit results of this study to regulators in 2021. • In December 2020, we and AstraZeneca announced that the SOURCE trial had not met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in the daily OCS dose, without loss of asthma control, with tezepelumab compared to placebo. The results of this trial have no impact on our submission plans. Cardiovascular Omecamtiv mecarbil • In November 2020, based on results of the omecamtiv mecarbil phase 3 trial, we provided notice to Cytokinetics, Incorporated (Cytokinetics) of termination of our collaboration and our intention to transition to them the development and commercialization rights for omecamtiv mecarbil and AMG 594. 2 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Establishment of wholly owned affiliate in Japan • In April 2020, we completed our purchase from Astellas of the remaining shares of Amgen Astellas BioPharma K.K. (AABP), a joint venture between Amgen and Astellas established in 2013. AABP, now a wholly owned Amgen affiliate in Japan and renamed Amgen K.K., has enabled us to build a strong presence in Japan as we continue to advance treatments for serious illnesses. The purchase did not have a material impact to our consolidated financial statements. Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products The largest concentration of our sales and marketing forces is based in the United States and Europe. In addition, we continue to expand the commercialization and marketing of our products into other geographic territories, including parts of Asia, the Middle East, Canada and Latin America. This expansion is occurring by establishing our own affiliates, by acquiring existing third-party businesses or product rights or by collaborating with third parties. See Business Relationships for our significant alliances. Whether we use our own sales and marketing forces or a third party’s varies across these markets. Such use typically depends on several factors, including the nature of entry into the new market, the size of an opportunity and operational capabilities. Together with our collaborators, we market our products to healthcare providers, including physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. In the United States, substantially all of our sales are to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, which are the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. We also market certain products through direct-to-consumer channels, including print, television and online media. For further discussion, see Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. Our product sales to three large wholesalers, AmerisourceBergen Corporation, McKesson Corporation and Cardinal Health, Inc., each individually accounted for more than 10% of total revenues for each of the years 2020, 2019 and 2018. On a combined basis, these wholesalers accounted for 83%, 81% and 84% of worldwide gross revenues for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance. 3 \f                                                                                                                                                                                  -------Our products are marketed around the world, with the United States being our largest market.

XGEVA® was launched in 2010 and is used primarily in the indication for prevention of skeletal-related events (SREs) (pathological fracture, radiation to bone, spinal cord compression or surgery to bone) in patients with bone metastases from solid tumors and multiple myeloma. Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) We market Aranesp® primarily in the United States and Europe. It was launched in 2001 and is indicated to treat a lower­than-normal number of red blood cells (anemia) caused by chronic kidney disease (CKD) in both patients on dialysis and patients not on dialysis. Aranesp® is also indicated for the treatment of anemia due to concomitant myelosuppressive chemotherapy in certain patients with nonmyeloid malignancies and when chemotherapy will be used for at least two months after starting Aranesp®. KYPROLIS® We market KYPROLIS® primarily in the United States and Europe. KYPROLIS® was launched in 2012 and is indicated in combination with dexamethasone or with lenalidomide plus dexamethasone for the treatment of patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one to three prior lines of therapy. It is also approved as a single agent for patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma who have received one or more previous therapies. In September 2019, the CANDOR phase 3 study of KYPROLIS® in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX® (daratumumab) met its primary endpoint of PFS in patients with relapsed or refractory multiple myeloma. In August 2020, the FDA approved the expansion of the KYPROLIS® U.S. prescribing information to include its use in combination with dexamethasone and DARZALEX®. 5 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Repatha® (evolocumab) We market Repatha®, a proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9), primarily in the United States and Europe.

Competition We operate in a highly competitive environment. A number of our marketed products are indicated for disease areas in which other products or treatments are currently available or are being pursued by our competitors through research and development (R&D) activities. Additionally, some competitor-marketed products target the same genetic pathways as our recently launched marketed products or are currently in development. This competition could impact the pricing and market share of our products. We continue to pursue ways of increasing the value of our medicines through innovations during their life cycles, which can include expanding the disease areas for which our products are indicated and finding new methods to make the delivery of our medicines easier and less costly. Such activities can offer important opportunities for differentiation. For example, we market the Neulasta® Onpro® kit, which provides physicians the opportunity to initiate the administration of the recommended dose of Neulasta® on the same day as chemotherapy, with drug delivery at home the day after chemotherapy, thereby saving patients a trip back to the doctor. We plan to continue pursuing innovation efforts to strengthen our competitive position. Such position may be based on, among other things, safety, efficacy, reliability, availability, patient convenience, delivery devices, price, reimbursement, access to and timing of market entry and patent position and expiration. Certain of the existing patents on our principal products have expired, and we face new and increasing competition, including from biosimilars and generics. A biosimilar is another version of a biological product for which marketing approval is sought or has been obtained based on a demonstration that it is “highly similar” to the original reference product. We expect that the adverse impact on our originator-product sales from biosimilar competition will reflect current trends and actual results given similar conditions. We also believe that when multiple biosimilar versions of one of our originator products get approved and launched, competition could intensify more rapidly, leading to net price declines for both reference and biosimilar products, resulting in a greater impact on our products’ sales. In the United States, companies have now launched biosimilar versions of EPOGEN®, NEUPOGEN® and Neulasta® and have approved biosimilars for ENBREL. See also Government Regulation— Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. Although we expect competitor biosimilars to compete on price, we believe many patients, providers and payers will continue to place high value on the reputation, reliability and safety of our products. As additional biosimilar competitors come to market, we will leverage our global experience versus both branded and biosimilar competition. We also have our own biosimilar products both in the United States and outside of U.S. markets that are competing against branded and biosimilar versions of our competitors’ products. In 2019, Amgen launched MVASI®, a biosimilar to Avastin® (bevacizumab), and KANJINTI®, a biosimilar to Herceptin® (trastuzumab), in the United States; and AMGEVITATM, a biosimilar to Humira® (adalimumab) in Europe. We have also received FDA approval for AMJEVITATM (adalimumab-atto), a biosimilar to Humira®. In 2020, we launched AVSOLA®, a biosimilar to Remicade® (infliximab), and in January 2021, we launched RIABNITM, a biosimilar for Rituxan® (rituximab). We expect additional biosimilar competition against both our branded and biosimilar products in the future across all markets. 8 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In addition, although most of our products are biologics, some are small molecule products. Because the FDA approval process permits generic manufacturers to rely on the safety and efficacy data of the innovator product rather than having to conduct their own costly and time-consuming clinical trials, generic manufacturers can often develop and market their competing versions of our small molecule products at much lower prices. For example, following loss of exclusivity of patents directed to cinacalcet, the active ingredient in our small molecule calcimimetic Sensipar®, we lost a significant share of the market and corresponding revenues in a very short period of time. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The introduction of new products, the development of new processes or technologies by competitors or the emergence of new information about existing products may result (i) in increased competition for our marketed products, even for those protected by patents and/or (ii) in reductions in the prices we receive from selling our products. In addition, the development of new treatment options or standards of care may reduce the use of our products or may limit the utility and application of ongoing clinical trials for our product candidates. (As used in this document, the term clinical trials may include prospective clinical trials, observational studies, registries and other studies.) See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our products face substantial competition and Item 1A. Risk Factors—We currently face competition from biosimilars and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. 9 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Alendronate, raloxifene and U.S. & Europe Various zoledronate generics U.S. UDENYCA® Coherus BioSciences, Inc.

Reimbursement Sales of our principal products are dependent on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers. In many markets around the world, these payers, including government health systems, private health insurers and other organizations, remain focused on reducing the cost of healthcare; and their efforts have intensified as a result of rising healthcare costs, economic pressures and broader challenges generated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Drugs remain heavily scrutinized for cost containment. As a result, payers are becoming more restrictive regarding the use of biopharmaceutical products and are scrutinizing the prices of these products while requiring a higher level of clinical evidence to support the benefits such products bring to patients and the broader healthcare system. These pressures are intensified when our products are subject to competition, including from biosimilars. 10 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      In the United States, healthcare providers and other entities such as pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) are reimbursed for covered services and products they deliver through both private-payer and government healthcare programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. We provide negotiated rebates to healthcare providers, private payers, government payers and PBMs. In addition, we are required to (i) provide rebates or discounts on our products that are reimbursed through certain government programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, and (ii) provide discounts to qualifying healthcare providers under the federal 340B Drug Pricing Program. Both private and government payers use formularies to manage access and utilization of drugs. A drug’s inclusion and favorable positioning on a formulary are essential to ensure patients have access to a particular drug. Even when access is available, some patients abandon their prescriptions for economic reasons. Payers continue to institute cost reduction and containment measures that lower drug utilization and/or spending altogether and/or shift a greater portion of the costs to patients. Such measures include, but are not limited to, more-limited benefit plan designs, higher patient co-pays or coinsurance obligations, limitations on patients’ use of commercial manufacturer co-pay payment assistance programs (including through co-pay accumulator adjustment or maximization programs), stricter utilization management criteria before a patient may get access to a drug, higher-tier formulary placement that increases the level of patient out-of-pocket costs and formulary exclusion, which effectively encourages patients and providers to seek alternative treatments or pay 100% of the cost of a drug. The use of such measures by PBMs and insurers has continued to intensify and has thereby limited Amgen product usage and sales. Furthermore, during the past few years, many PBMs and insurers have consolidated, resulting in a smaller number of PBMs and insurers overseeing a large portion of total covered lives in the United States. As a result, PBMs and insurers have greater market power and negotiating leverage to mandate stricter utilization criteria and/or exclude drugs from their formularies in favor of competitor drugs or alternative treatments. In highly competitive treatment markets such as the markets for ENBREL, Otezla®, Repatha® and Aimovig®, PBMs are also able to exert negotiating leverage by requiring incremental rebates from manufacturers in order for them to gain and/or maintain their formulary position. In addition to market actions taken by private and government payers in the United States, policy makers from both of the major U.S. political parties are pursuing policies to lower drug costs. Potential policies cover a wide range of areas, including allowing the importation of drugs from other countries; instituting international reference pricing (IRP) schemes, which would set the prices of certain drugs based on those available in other countries; establishing caps on price increases based on inflation metrics; increasing transparency on drug pricing; and using third-party value assessments to determine drug prices. Examples of such policies include the previous Administration’s November 2020 interim final rule, which attempts to institute most favored nation (MFN) IRP in Medicare Part B and final rule instituting rebate reform in Medicare Part D. Both of these rules are being challenged in court and therefore have not yet been implemented. The direction of drug pricing policy reforms remains unclear at this time. In many countries outside the United States, government-sponsored healthcare systems are the primary payers for drugs and biologics. With increasing budgetary constraints and/or difficulty in understanding the value of medicines, governments and payers in many countries are applying a variety of measures to exert downward price pressure. These measures can include mandatory price controls, price referencing, therapeutic-reference pricing, increases in mandates, incentives for generic substitution and biosimilar usage and government-mandated price cuts. In this regard, many countries have health technology assessment organizations that use formal economic metrics such as cost-effectiveness to determine prices, coverage and reimbursement of new therapies; and these organizations are expanding in both established and emerging markets. Many countries also limit coverage to populations narrower than those specified on our product labels or impose volume caps to limit utilization. We expect that countries will continue taking aggressive actions to seek to reduce expenditures on drugs and biologics. Similarly, fiscal constraints may also affect the extent to which countries are willing to approve new and innovative therapies and/or allow access to new technologies. 11 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The dynamics and developments discussed above serve to create pressure on the pricing and potential usage of our products and the industry. Given the diverse interests in play between payers, biopharmaceutical manufacturers, policy makers, healthcare providers and independent organizations, if and whether the parties involved can achieve alignment on the matters discussed above remain unclear, and the outcome of any such alignment is difficult to predict. We remain focused on pricing our products responsibly and delivering breakthrough treatments for unmet medical needs. Amgen is committed to working with the entire healthcare community to ensure continued innovation and to facilitate patient access to needed medicines. We do this by: • investing billions of dollars annually in R&D; • developing more affordable therapeutic choices in the form of high-quality and reliably supplied biosimilars; • pricing our medicines to reflect the value they provide; • partnering with payers to share risk and accountability for health outcomes; • providing patient support and education programs; • helping patients in financial need access our medicines; and • working with policy makers, patients and other stakeholders to establish a sustainable healthcare system with access to affordable care and where patients and their healthcare professionals are the primary decision makers. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability and Item 1A. Risk Factors—Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials Manufacturing We believe we are a leader in the manufacture of biologics and that our manufacturing capabilities represent a competitive advantage. The products we manufacture consist of both biologics and small molecule drugs. The majority of our products are biologics that are produced in living cells and that are inherently complex due to naturally occurring molecular variations. Highly specialized knowledge and extensive process and product characterization are required to transform laboratory-scale processes into reproducible commercial manufacturing processes. Further, our expertise in the manufacture of biologics positions us well for leadership in the global biosimilars market. For additional information regarding manufacturing facilities, see Item 2. Properties. Our internal manufacturing network has commercial production capabilities for bulk manufacturing, formulation, fill, finish, tableting and device assembly. These activities are performed within the United States and its territories in our Puerto Rico, Rhode Island and California facilities as well as internationally in our Ireland, Netherlands and Singapore facilities. In addition, we use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our commercial manufacturing network. To support our clinical trials, we manufacture product candidates primarily at our California facilities. We also use third-party contract manufacturers to supplement the capacity or capability of our overall clinical manufacturing network. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Distribution We operate distribution centers in Puerto Rico, Kentucky, California and the Netherlands for worldwide distribution of the majority of our commercial and clinical products. We also use third-party distributors to supplement distribution of our products worldwide. Other In addition to the manufacturing and distribution activities noted above, each of our manufacturing locations includes key manufacturing support functions such as quality control, process development, engineering, procurement, production scheduling and warehousing. Certain of those manufacturing and distribution activities are highly regulated by the FDA as well as international regulatory agencies. See Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Regulation of Manufacturing Standards. 12 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Manufacturing Initiatives We have multiple ongoing initiatives that are designed to extend our manufacturing advantage by optimizing our manufacturing network and/or by mitigating risks while continuing to ensure adequate supply of our products. For example, our licensed next-generation biomanufacturing plant operating in Singapore incorporates multiple innovative technologies into a single facility and was built in half the construction time and at approximately half the operating cost of a traditional plant. Next-generation biomanufacturing plants require smaller manufacturing footprints and offer greater environmental benefits, including reduced consumption of water and energy and lower levels of carbon emissions. Within such plants, the equipment is portable and smaller, and some components are disposable, which provides greater flexibility and speed when manufacturing different medicines simultaneously. This eliminates the otherwise costly and complex retrofitting inherent in standard plants and enables Amgen to respond to changing demands for its medicines with increased agility, ultimately increasing the speed at which a medicine can become available for patients. The Singapore site also has a plant that has been approved to produce small molecule drugs for commercial manufacturing. In July 2018, we broke ground for our newest next-generation biomanufacturing plant at our West Greenwich, Rhode Island, campus. Construction on this new plant, the first of its kind in the United States, is complete. Upon approval by the FDA and global regulatory authorities, this plant will expand our capacity to manufacture certain products for U.S. and global markets. In 2019, we initiated projects to expand our manufacturing capabilities in Thousand Oaks, California, as well as at contract manufacturers. These investments will initially support clinical manufacturing but in the future may also be leveraged for commercial manufacturing. In September 2020, we entered into an arrangement with Lilly to manufacture Lilly’s potential COVID-19 therapies. For 2021—and, potentially, through 2022—we expect to allocate a portion of our manufacturing capacity to support this production. Additionally, starting in 2021, we will initiate projects that will expand our manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates. These projects will employ new technologies that are being developed by Amgen that are anticipated to allow further optimization of our manufacturing network and processes. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Raw Materials and Medical Devices Certain raw materials, medical devices (including companion diagnostics) and components necessary for the commercial and/or clinical manufacturing of our products are provided by and are the proprietary products of unaffiliated third-party suppliers, certain of which may be our only sources for such materials. We currently attempt to manage the risk associated with such suppliers by means of inventory management, relationship management and evaluation of alternative sources when feasible. We also monitor the financial condition of certain suppliers and their ability to supply our needs. See Item 1A. Risk Factors—We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We perform various procedures to help authenticate the sources of raw materials, including intermediary materials used in the manufacture of our products, which include verification of the country of origin. The procedures are incorporated into the manufacturing processes we and our third-party contract manufacturers perform. To better ensure supply, Amgen has a risk mitigation strategy that uses a combination of methods, including multiple sources or backup inventory of critical raw materials. In response to COVID-19, we continue to closely monitor our inventory levels and have taken additional measures to mitigate against raw material supply interruption as part of our ongoing business continuity efforts. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of the factors that could adversely impact our manufacturing operations and the global supply of our products. Government Regulation Regulation by government authorities in the United States and other countries is a significant factor in the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing R&D activities. To clinically test, manufacture and market products for therapeutic use, we must satisfy mandatory procedures and safety and effectiveness standards established by various regulatory bodies. Compliance with these standards is complex, and failure to comply with any of these standards can result in significant implications. See Item 1A. Risk Factors for a discussion of factors, including global regulatory implications, that can adversely impact our development and marketing of commercial products. 13 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Regulation in the United States In the United States, the Public Health Service Act; the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FDCA); and the regulations promulgated thereunder as well as other federal and state statutes and regulations govern, among other things, the production, research, development, testing, manufacture, quality control, labeling, storage, record keeping, approval, advertising, promotion and distribution of our products in addition to the reporting of certain payments and other transfers of value to healthcare professionals and teaching hospitals. Clinical Development and Product Approval. Drug development in our industry is complex, challenging and risky, and failure rates are high. Product development cycles are typically very long—approximately 10 to 15 years from discovery to market. A potential new medicine must undergo many years of preclinical and clinical testing to establish its safety and efficacy for use in humans at appropriate dosing levels and with an acceptable risk–benefit profile. We continue to work toward reducing cycle times by applying our expertise in human genetics and innovation in technology, clinical trials and real-world evidence. After laboratory analysis and preclinical testing in animals, we file an Investigational New Drug Application (IND) with the FDA to begin human testing. Typically, we undertake an FDA-designated three-phase human clinical testing program. • In phase 1, we conduct small clinical trials to investigate the safety and proper dose ranges of our product candidates in a small number of human subjects. • In phase 2, we conduct clinical trials to investigate side-effect profiles and the efficacy of our product candidates in a patient population larger than phase 1 but still relatively small, who have the disease or condition under study. • In phase 3, we conduct clinical trials to investigate the short- and long-term safety and efficacy of our product candidates, compared to commonly used treatments, in a large number of patients who have the disease or condition under study. The FDA monitors the progress of each trial conducted under an IND and may, at its discretion, reevaluate, alter, suspend or terminate the testing based on the data accumulated to that point and the FDA’s risk–benefit assessment with regard to the patients enrolled in the trial. The results of preclinical and clinical trials are submitted to the FDA in the form of either a Biologics License Application for biologic products or a NDA for small molecule products. We are not permitted to market or promote a new product until the FDA has approved our marketing application. Approval of Biosimilars. The Affordable Care Act (ACA) authorized the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. The pathway allows sponsors of a biosimilar to seek and obtain regulatory approval based in part on the nonclinical-trial and clinical-trial data of an originator product to which the biosimilar has been demonstrated to be “highly similar” and to have no clinically meaningful differences in terms of safety, purity and potency. The relevance of demonstrating “similarity” is that in many cases, biosimilars can be brought to market without conducting the full suite of clinical trials typically required of originators, because risk–benefit has previously been established. To preserve incentives for future innovation, the law establishes a period of exclusivity for originators’ products, which in general prohibits biosimilars from gaining FDA approval based in part on reliance on or reference to the originator’s data in their application to the FDA for 12 years after initial FDA approval of the originator product. The law does not change the duration of patents granted on biologic products. As part of the implementation of the abbreviated approval pathway for biosimilars, the FDA released a number of guidance documents, some of which remain in draft form. Regulation of Product Marketing and Promotion. The FDA regulates the marketing and promotion of drug products. Our product promotions for approved product indications must comply with the statutory standards of the FDCA and the FDA’s implemented regulations and guidance. The FDA’s review of marketing and promotional activities encompasses but is not limited to direct-to-consumer advertising, healthcare-provider-directed advertising and promotion, sales representative communications to healthcare professionals, promotional programming and promotional activities involving electronic media. The FDA may also review industry-sponsored scientific and educational activities that make representations regarding product safety or efficacy in a promotional context. The FDA may take enforcement action against a company for promoting unapproved uses of a product or for other violations of the FDA’s advertising and labeling laws and regulations. Enforcement action may include product seizures, injunctions, civil or criminal penalties or regulatory letters, which may require corrective advertising or other corrective communications to healthcare professionals. Failure to comply with the FDA’s regulations also can result in adverse publicity or increased scrutiny of company activities by the U.S. Congress or other legislators. Additionally, as described below, such failure may lead to additional liability under U.S. healthcare fraud and abuse laws. 14 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Regulation of Manufacturing Standards. The FDA regulates and inspects the equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes used in the manufacturing and testing of products prior to granting approval to market products. If after receiving approval from the FDA we make a material change in manufacturing equipment, location or process, additional regulatory review may be required. We also must adhere to current Good Manufacturing Practice regulations and product-specific regulations enforced by the FDA through its facilities inspection program. The FDA conducts regular, periodic visits to reinspect our equipment, facilities, laboratories and processes following an initial approval. Regulation of Combination Products. Combination products are defined by the FDA as products composed of two or more regulated components (e.g., a biologic and/or drug and a device). Biologics/drugs and devices each have their own regulatory requirements, and combination products may have additional requirements. A number of our marketed products meet this definition and are regulated under this framework, and we expect that a number of our pipeline product candidates will be evaluated for regulatory approval under this framework as well. Regulation outside the United States In European Union (EU) countries as well as in Switzerland, Canada, Australia and Japan, regulatory requirements and approval processes are similar in principle to those in the United States. In the EU, there are currently two potential tracks for seeking marketing approval for a product not authorized in any EU member state: a decentralized procedure and a centralized procedure. In the decentralized procedure, identical applications for marketing authorization are submitted simultaneously to the national regulatory agencies. Regulatory review is led by one member state (the reference-member state), and its assessment—based on safety, quality and efficacy—is reviewed and approved (assuming there are no concerns that the product poses a serious risk to public health) by the other member states from which the applicant is seeking approval (the concerned-member states). The decentralized procedure leads to a series of single national approvals in all relevant countries. In the centralized procedure, which is required of all products derived from biotechnology, a company submits a single MAA to the EMA, which conducts an evaluation of the dossier, drawing upon its scientific resources across Europe. If the drug product is proven to fulfill requirements for quality, safety and efficacy, the EMA’s Committee for Medicinal Products of Human Use (CHMP) adopts a positive opinion, which is transmitted to the European Commission (EC) for final decision on granting of the marketing authorization. Even though the EC generally follows the CHMP’s opinion, it is not bound to do so. Subsequent commercialization is enabled by country-by-country reimbursement approval. In the EU, biosimilars are approved under a specialized pathway of the centralized procedure. As with the U.S. pathway, an applicant seeks and obtains regulatory approval for a biosimilar once the data exclusivity period for the original reference product has expired, relying in part on the data submitted for the originator product together with data evidencing that the biosimilar is “highly similar” in terms of quality, safety and efficacy to the original reference product authorized in the European Economic Area. As a result of the United Kingdom’s decision to leave the EU, the EMA in March 2019 relocated to Amsterdam. The United Kingdom officially left the EU in January 2020, and in December 2020, a new trade deal was agreed that starts to clarify how U.K. medicines will be independently supervised and where continued collaborations and recognitions can be expected. Amgen continues to monitor future negotiations to ensure no interruption in the supervision, regulation or supply of medicines in the United Kingdom and Europe. Other countries such as Russia, Turkey and those in Latin America and the Middle East have review processes and data requirements similar to those of the EU and in some cases can rely on prior marketing approval from U.S. or EU regulatory authorities. The regulatory process in these countries may include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. In Asia Pacific, a number of countries such as China, Japan, South Korea and Taiwan may require local clinical-trial data for bridging purposes as part of the drug registration process in addition to global clinical trials, which can add to overall drug development and registration timelines. In most of the Asian markets, registration timelines depend on marketing approval in the United States or the EU. In some markets in Asia, such as China, Indonesia and Thailand, the regulatory timelines can be less predictable. The regulatory process may also include manufacturing/testing facility inspections, testing of drug product upon importation and other domestic requirements. Countries such as Australia and Japan have more-mature systems that would allow for submissions under more-competitive time frames. Regarding biosimilars, several of these countries have pathways to register biosimilars (e.g., Australia, India, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan), and biosimilar products are already present on the markets (e.g., Australia and South Korea). 15 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                In some countries, such as Japan and those in the EU, medical devices may be subject to regulatory regimes whereby manufacturers must establish that their medical devices conform to essential requirements set out in the law for the particular device category. For example, in the EU, with limited exceptions, medical devices placed on the market must bear the Conformité Européenne marking to indicate their conformity with legal requirements. Postapproval Phase After approval, we continue to monitor adverse events and product complaints reported following the use of our products through routine postmarketing surveillance and studies when applicable. We report such events to the appropriate regulatory agencies as required by local regulations for individual cases and aggregate reports. We proactively monitor (according to good pharmacovigilance practices) and ensure the implementation of signal detection, assessment and the communication of adverse events that may be associated with the use of our products. We also proactively monitor product complaints through our quality systems, which includes assessing our drug delivery devices for device complaints, adverse events and malfunctions. We may also be required by regulatory agencies to conduct further clinical trials on our marketed products as a condition of their approval or to provide additional information on safety and efficacy. Health regulators, including the FDA, have authority to mandate labeling changes to products at any point in a product’s life cycle based on new safety information or as part of an evolving label change to a particular class of products. Health regulators, including the FDA, also have authority, before or after approval, to require a company to implement a risk management program for a product to ensure that the benefits of the drug outweigh the risks. Each risk management program is unique and varies depending on the specific factors required. In the United States, a risk management program is known as a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS), and we currently have REMSs for Prolia®, Nplate® and BLINCYTO®. Other Regulation We are also subject to various laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse, including antikickback laws and false-claims laws. Antikickback laws make it illegal to solicit, offer, receive or pay any remuneration in exchange for or to induce the referral of business, including the purchase or prescribing of a particular drug that is reimbursed by a state or federal program. False-claims laws prohibit knowingly and willingly presenting or causing to be presented for payment to third-party payers (including Medicare and Medicaid) any claims for reimbursed drugs or services that are false or fraudulent, claims for items or services not provided as claimed or claims for medically unnecessary items or services. Violations of fraud and abuse laws may be punishable by criminal and/or civil sanctions, including fines and civil monetary penalties, as well as by the possibility of exclusion from federal healthcare programs (including Medicare and Medicaid). Liability under the false-claims laws may also arise when a violation of certain laws or regulations related to the underlying product (e.g., violations regarding improper promotional activity or unlawful payments) contributes to the submission of a false claim. In 2012, Amgen entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of Inspector General (OIG) of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services (HHS), which was formally closed out in August 2018. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations related to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. Additionally, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. Due to the breadth of the statutory provisions and the absence of guidance in the form of regulations or court decisions addressing some of our practices, it is possible that in the future, our practices might be further challenged under antikickback or similar laws. The U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act (FCPA) prohibits U.S. corporations and their representatives from offering, promising, authorizing or making payments to any foreign government official, government staff member, political party or political candidate in an attempt to obtain or retain business abroad. The scope of the FCPA arguably includes interactions with certain healthcare professionals in many countries. Other countries have enacted similar anticorruption laws and/or regulations. Failure by our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators to comply with the FCPA and other anticorruption laws and/or regulations could result in significant civil or criminal penalties. We are subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection. These laws and regulations involve the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environments regarding privacy and data protection are continually evolving and developing, as these issues are the subjects of increasing amounts of attention in countries globally. For example, we are subject to the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which became effective on May 25, 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective on January 1, 2020. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Failure to comply with these laws could result in significant penalties. 16 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Our business has been and will continue to be subject to various other U.S. and foreign laws, rules and regulations. See Reimbursement section above. Research and Development and Selected Product Candidates We focus our R&D on novel human therapeutics for the treatment of serious illness. We capitalize on our strengths in human genetics, novel biology and protein engineering. We leverage our biologic expertise and take a modality-independent approach to R&D. And we use cutting-edge science and technology to study subtle biological mechanisms in search of therapies that will improve the lives of those who suffer from diseases. Our discovery research programs may therefore yield targets that lead to the development of human therapeutics delivered as large molecules, small molecules, other combination modalities or new modalities. We have reshaped our portfolio and have increasingly focused our efforts on human genetics when possible to enhance the likelihood of success. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we managed our clinical development on a case-by-case basis. Patients who were already enrolled in studies continued to receive study drug, including through direct-to-patient shipments. For studies that had the potential for significant benefit in a serious or life-threatening condition and when site resources enabled new patients to be enrolled safely and monitored closely, we continued enrollment. For clinical trials experiencing uncertainty with regard to the trial sites’ ability to ensure subject safety or data integrity at that time, we temporarily paused enrollment. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and providing investigational drug supply. To date, the majority of clinical trials that were paused at the onset of the pandemic to ensure subject safety or data integrity have resumed. Study enrollments were affected the most in the second quarter of 2020 and by the end of the year resumed to prepandemic levels, although COVID-19 infection rates and related vaccination activities may impact future patient enrollment. We continuously monitor and reevaluate the status of studies, pausing when uncertainty arises with regard to the trial sites’ ability to ensure safety or data integrity. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and in providing investigational drug supply. In addition, our R&D organization is supporting efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including by (i) working to support production of therapeutic antibodies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19 on patients, (ii) joining a public–private partnership between leading companies in our industry and U.S. government health agencies to develop a strategy for a coordinated research response and (iii) participating in platform studies to investigate treatments in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infections. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, our R&D expenses were $4.2 billion, $4.1 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively. We have major R&D centers in Thousand Oaks and San Francisco, California; Iceland; and the United Kingdom, as well as smaller research centers and development facilities globally. See Item 2. Properties. Our clinical trial activities are conducted by both our internal staff and third-party contract clinical trial service providers. To increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened clinical sites and will continue opening clinical sites and enrolling patients in a number of geographic locations. See Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Clinical Development and Product Approval for a discussion of government regulation over clinical development. Also see Item 1A. Risk Factors—We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Some of our competitors are actively engaged in R&D in areas in which we have products or in which we are developing product candidates or new indications for existing products. For example, we compete with other clinical trials for eligible patients, which may limit the number of available patients who meet the criteria for certain clinical trials. The competitive marketplace for our product candidates is greatly dependent on the timing of entry into the market. Early entry may have important advantages in gaining product acceptance, thereby contributing to a product’s eventual success and profitability. Accordingly, we expect that in some cases, the relative speed with which we can develop products, complete clinical testing, receive regulatory approval and supply commercial quantities of a product to the market will be important to our competitive position. In addition to product candidates and marketed products generated from our internal R&D efforts, we acquire companies, acquire and license certain product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D arrangements with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed product base. In pursuing these R&D arrangements and licensing or acquisition activities, we face competition from other pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that also seek to license or acquire technologies, product candidates or marketed products from those entities performing the R&D. 17 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        The following table shows a selection of certain of our product candidates by phase of development in our therapeutic areas of focus as of February 2, 2021, unless otherwise indicated.

RIABNITM launched in the United States in January 2021. Rozibafusp alfa Rozibafusp alfa is a novel bispecific antibody-peptide conjugate that simultaneously blocks the B lymphocyte stimulator (BAFF) and inducible costimulatory ligand (ICOSL) activity. It is being investigated as a treatment for systemic lupus erythematosus. Sotorasib Sotorasib is a KRAS G12C small molecule inhibitor. It is being investigated as a treatment for a variety of solid tumors, including NSCLC, colorectal cancer and other solid tumor cancers. In December 2020, we announced that the FDA had granted Breakthrough Therapy designation for sotorasib for the treatment of patients with locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with KRAS G12C mutation as determined by an FDA-approved test, following at least one prior systemic therapy. The sotorasib application is being reviewed under the FDA’s RTOR pilot program, which aims to explore a more efficient review process that ensures safe and effective treatments are made available to patients as early as possible. In January 2021, we announced phase 2 results from the CodeBreaK 100 clinical study, evaluating sotorasib in 126 patients with KRAS G12C-mutant advanced NSCLC, who had failed a median of two prior lines of anticancer therapies (immunotherapy and/or chemotherapy). Sotorasib demonstrated a confirmed ORR (primary end point) and disease control rate of 37.1% and 80.6%, respectively, a median duration of response of 10 months and median progression-free survival of 6.8 months. Patients were treated with sotorasib 960 mg once daily orally. Tezepelumab Tezepelumab is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits the action of thymic stromal lymphopoietin. It is being evaluated in phase 3 as a treatment for severe asthma. It is also being investigated in phase 2 for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Tezepelumab is being developed jointly in collaboration with AstraZeneca. In November 2020, we announced positive results from the registrational phase 3 NAVIGATOR trial, in which the investigational medicine tezepelumab demonstrated a statistically significant reduction in exacerbations compared to placebo in patients with severe asthma. The NAVIGATOR trial met the primary endpoint with tezepelumab added to SoC, demonstrating a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction compared to placebo plus SoC in the AAER over 52 weeks in the overall patient population. SoC consisted of medium- or high-dose ICS plus at least one additional controller medication with or without OCS. In December 2020, we announced that the SOURCE trial had not met the primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction in the daily OCS dose, without loss of asthma control, with tezepelumab compared to placebo. The results of this trial have no impact on our submission plans. AMG 714/PRV-015 AMG 714/PRV-015 is a human monoclonal antibody that binds to interleukin-15.

It is being investigated in a phase 3 study for PNH. The reference-product primary conditions are PNH and atypical hemolytic uremic syndrome (aHUS). Business Relationships From time to time, we enter into business relationships, including joint ventures and collaborative arrangements, for the R&D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. In addition, we acquire product and R&D technology rights and establish R&D collaborations with third parties to enhance our strategic position within our industry by strengthening and diversifying our R&D capabilities, product pipeline and marketed-product base. These arrangements generally provide for nonrefundable, upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. The activities under these collaboration agreements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each is unique in nature. Trade secret protection for our unpatented confidential and proprietary information is important to us. To protect our trade secrets, we generally require counterparties to execute confidentiality agreements upon commencement of a business relationship with us. However, others could either develop independently the same or similar information or unlawfully obtain access to our information. BeiGene, Ltd. On January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene) for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene commenced selling XGEVA® and will commercialize KYPROLIS® and BLINCYTO® in China, and Amgen will share profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period. In addition, we will jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene sharing in global R&D costs by providing cash and development services up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiGene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside of China, Amgen will also pay BeiGene royalties. Novartis We are in a collaboration with Novartis to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig®. In the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly develop and collaborate on the commercialization of Aimovig®. Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of Aimovig® in the United States, shares U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and pays Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig®. Novartis pays Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the Novartis-exclusive territories and funds a portion of global R&D expenses. In addition, Novartis will make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds are achieved with respect to Aimovig® in the United States. Amgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig® worldwide. We are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig®. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Bayer HealthCare LLC We are in a licensing arrangement with Bayer HealthCare LLC (Bayer) for Nexavar®. In February 2020, we amended the terms of our agreement with Bayer, which transferred all of our operational responsibilities outside the United States to Bayer, including commercial and medical affairs activities. Prior to the amendment of the agreement, we shared equally in the profits outside the United States, excluding Japan. In lieu of this profit share, Bayer now pays us a royalty on sales of Nexavar® at a percentage rate in the low 30s. The rights to develop and market Nexavar® in Japan are reserved to Bayer. In the United States, Bayer pays us a royalty on sales of Nexavar® at a percentage rate in the high 30s. 23 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        DaVita Inc. In January 2017, we entered into a six-year supply agreement with DaVita Inc. (DaVita), which superseded the previously existing, seven-year supply agreement that commenced in 2012. Pursuant to the 2017 agreement, we supply EPOGEN® and Aranesp® in amounts necessary to meet specified annual percentages of DaVita’s and its affiliates’ requirements for erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) used in providing dialysis services in the United States and Puerto Rico. Such percentages vary during the term of the agreement, but in each year are at least 90%. The agreement expires in 2022. The agreement may be terminated by either party before expiration of its term in the event of certain breaches of the agreement by the other party. For financial information concerning our significant collaborative arrangements, see Part IV—Note 8, Collaborations, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Human Capital Resources Amgen’s approach to human capital resource management starts with our mission to serve patients. Our industry exists in a complex regulatory and reimbursement environment. The unique demands of our industry, together with the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, manufacture and commercialization of innovative medicines, require talent that is highly educated and/or has significant industry experience. Additionally, for certain key functions, we require specific scientific expertise to oversee and conduct R&D activities and the complex manufacturing requirements for biopharmaceutical products. As of December 31, 2020, Amgen had approximately 24,300 staff members, and we have had relatively low global turnover rates. We consider our staff relations to be good; supported by our regular staff engagement assessments, with surveys on a wide range of topics (including engagement in the COVID-19 environment, diversity, inclusion and belonging and ethics). We discuss the results of these surveys with our Board of Directors. Compensation, Benefits and Development Our approach to employee compensation and benefits is designed to deliver cash, equity and benefit programs that are competitive with those offered by leading companies in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries to attract, motivate and retain talent with a focus on encouraging performance, promoting accountability and adherence to Company values and alignment with the interests of the Company’s shareholders. Our base pay program aims to compensate staff members relative to the value of the contributions of their role, which takes into account the skills, knowledge and abilities required to perform each position, as well as the experience brought to the job. We also provide annual incentive programs to reward our staff in alignment with achievement of Company-wide goals that are established annually and designed to drive aspects of our strategic priorities that support and advance our strategy across our Company. The majority of our staff members are also eligible for the grant of equity awards under our long-term incentive program that are designed to align the experience of these staff with that of our shareholders. All staff also participate in a regular performance measurement process that aligns pay to performance and through which staff receive performance and development feedback. To support the development of our staff, we provide a variety of programs, including leadership development programs, virtual instructor-led courses and self-paced learning options. Our benefit programs are also generally broad-based, promote health and overall well-being and emphasize saving for retirement. All regular U.S. staff members are eligible to participate in the same core health and welfare and retirement savings plans. Other U.S. employee benefits include medical plans, dental plans, access to childcare, employee assistance programs, employee stock purchase plan, flexible spending accounts, life, long-term care and business travel accident insurance, short and long-term disability benefits, wellness benefits and work-life resources and referrals. Comparable programs and benefits are available globally, with the same health and well-being intent, consistent with statutory requirements. Our Compensation and Management Development Committee provides oversight of our compensation plans, policies and programs. 24 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Safety and Wellness and Our Response to COVID-19 Creating a safe and healthy workplace for our staff is a priority at Amgen. Our goal is to have a world class safety record through safety leadership, risk management practices and integrating safety throughout our business processes. To foster our safety culture, we implement a comprehensive safety program, driving to understand and mitigate the root cause of safety incidents and manage and control variability. We use leading indicators to assess the effectiveness of our safety programs and make course corrections as needed. Additionally, we perform formal executive management review of functional safety performance for Operations, Global Commercial Operations and R&D on a quarterly basis with a focus on identifying early signals and taking action to drive continuous improvement. Based on our 2019 performance, compared to a benchmark of twelve companies in the pharmaceutical industry, Amgen was in the quartile with the lowest injury rate. In response to the COVID-19 pandemic and as part of our commitment to work to ensure the safety and well-being of our employees, we have activated our applicable business continuity plans, including having those of our employees who are able to work from home to do so since mid-March 2020. For employees returning to the workplace and the field, we have also taken additional safety measures, including implementing occupancy limits, restricting business travel, providing and requiring the use of personal protective equipment, temperature screening and COVID-19 testing to access our workplaces. Our Corporate Responsibility and Compliance Committee provides general oversight of our safety programs and initiatives, while our Board of Directors, as a whole, has overseen our specific responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging We believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. Further, we also believe our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. It is with these beliefs in mind that we have continued to strengthen and grow our culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our internal efforts include, in 2019, establishing a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council chaired by our Chief Executive Officer. In 2020, we implemented a global unconscious bias training program, and launched a portal devoted to diversity, inclusion and belonging that includes learning and resources. Further, we are leveraging our Employee Resource Groups (listed below) to represent and support the diversity of Amgen staff: Employee Resource Groups Amgen Asian Association (AAA) Amgen Black Employee Network (ABEN) Ability Bettered through Leadership and Education (ABLE), a resource group for the physically or cognitively disabled Amgen Early Career Professionals (AECP) Amgen Indian Subcontinent Network (AISN) Amgen Latin Employee Network (ALEN) Amgen LGBTQ and Allies Network (PRIDE) Amgen Veterans Employees Network (AVEN) Women Empowered to be Exceptional (WE2) Women in Information Systems Enrichment (WISE) In areas of underrepresentation, we develop plans with a goal of bringing our representation in line with availability, and we also engage in outreach efforts to attract, retain and advance more women and minorities in our workforce. For example, we have worked to enhance our diverse candidate recruiting pool by developing relationships with organizations that can serve as a source of diverse candidates, such as the National Black MBA Association and National Sales Network, as well as historically black colleges and universities. Additionally, at the end of 2020, we became a founding member of OneTen, a coalition of 35 of the world’s largest, best-known companies, that aims to hire one million Black Americans (with a specific focus on those without four-year college degrees) into good-paying, family-sustaining jobs over the next ten years. Other examples of actions that we are taking in this area include investment and participation in Healthcare Businesswomen’s Association (a global organization focused on development and business networking for women in healthcare) and the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Anderson School of Management women’s leadership program. 25 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  In an effort to provide additional transparency into the makeup of our workforce, we intend to disclose our 2020 Consolidated EEO-1 Report after our submission of the report to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

RISK FACTORS This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. You should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties our business faces. The risks described below are not the only ones we face. Our business is also subject to the risks that affect many other companies, such as employment relations, general economic conditions, geopolitical events and international operations. Further, additional risks not currently known to us or that we currently believe are immaterial may in the future materially and adversely affect our business, operations, liquidity and stock price. SUMMARY Risks Related to Economic Conditions and Operating a Global Business, Including During the COVID-19 Pandemic • The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. • A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation. • Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. 27 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Risks Related to Government Regulations and Third-Party Policies • Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. • Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. • The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. • Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. Risks Related to Competition • Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition. • Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. • We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. • Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business. Risks Related to Research and Development • We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D. • We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. • Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. • Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. • Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. • Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. Risks Related to Operations • We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials. • We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. • Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. General Risk Factors • Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. • Our stock price is volatile • We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. 28 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      RISKS RELATED TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OPERATING A GLOBAL BUSINESS, INCLUDING DURING THE COVID-19 PANDEMIC The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. The novel coronavirus identified in late 2019, SARS-CoV-2, which causes the disease known as COVID-19, is an ongoing global pandemic that has resulted in public and governmental efforts to contain or slow the spread of the disease, including widespread shelter-in-place orders, social distancing interventions, quarantines, travel restrictions and various forms of operational shutdowns. The COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting measures implemented in response to the pandemic are adversely affecting, and is expected to continue to adversely affect, our business (including our R&D, clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development and sales activities), the business activities of our suppliers, customers, third-party payers and our patients. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval, and see also We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Due to the pandemic and these measures and their effects, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, unpredictable reductions in demand for certain of our products, and in some cases, have experienced, and could continue to experience, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products. Our clinical trials have been, and are expected to continue to be, adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. We have clinical work ongoing at investigational sites across the globe. A number of clinical trial sites, including those in regions experiencing new or resurgent outbreaks of COVID-19, have restricted site visits and imposed restrictions on the initiation of new clinical trials and/or patient visits to protect both site staff and patients from possible COVID-19 exposure that has stopped or slowed clinical trial activities. In response to the safety concerns related to COVID-19, we have suspended, and will continue to suspend, enrollment and screening in clinical trials where sites are unable to perform clinical trial work due to COVID-19 or there is uncertainty around the ability of sites to ensure subject safety or data integrity. Further, the COVID-19 pandemic has adversely affected, and may continue to adversely affect, our ability to enroll or to continue to enroll certain required post-marketing studies, including pediatric studies. While many of our clinical trial activities have recommenced over the course of 2020, the initial disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic to our clinical trials and our clinical trial plans and timelines, and any similar future disruptions (including as a result of the current surge and lockdowns in numerous regions), may have a significant adverse effect on our product development and launches, and, in turn, on future product sales, business and results of operations. For example, to ensure patient safety we initially paused enrollment of our sotorasib Phase 1 combination cohort with Keytruda® and Phase 3 lung cancer study, and such interruptions in enrollment may ultimately affect the timeline of these or other studies. Additionally, while we are investing in research, collaborations and operational support to potentially develop and/or produce treatments for COVID-19, such activities may not result in therapeutic candidates, product approvals, successful production and/or significant commercial value being derived from potential COVID-19-related medicines. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have experienced, and expect to continue to experience, regulatory delays, including delays in receiving regulatory advice, reviews of applications, or performance of inspections required for approvals. The pandemic may also result in greater regulatory uncertainty. For example, the FDA and the EMA have issued guidance to provide biopharmaceutical manufacturers greater flexibility in certain regulatory areas, including protocol deviations and adverse event reporting. However, such flexibility may result in greater uncertainty regarding the expectations of such health authorities in relation to this guidance. Additionally, there may be delays in ongoing or new patent office or patent proceedings in the United States or internationally that may delay the outcome of such proceedings. Such delays and disruptions could have a significant adverse effect on our product development and launches, product sales, business and results of operations. 29 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In response to COVID-19, we have activated our applicable business continuity plans, including suspending U.S. in-person meetings and interactions with the healthcare community and professionals in a substantial number of states, suspending, as a general matter, all international business travel and the majority of domestic travel within the United States, and U.S. employees who are able to work from home have been doing so since mid-March 2020. Our ability to perform critical functions and maintain operations have been adversely affected and could continue to be adversely affected as a result of such workforce restrictions, and the COVID-19-related support programs we have put into place for our staff, suppliers and customers have increased, and are expected to continue to increase, our operating expenses and reduce the efficiency of our operations. Notwithstanding such support programs, the COVID-19 pandemic’s effects on the health and availability of our workforce, as well as those of the third parties on which we rely, could have an adverse effect on our business. If members of our management and other key personnel in critical functions across our organization are unable to perform their duties or have limited availability due to COVID-19, we may not be able to execute on our business strategy and our operations may be adversely affected. Additionally, disruptions in public and private infrastructure, including transportation and supply chains, have adversely affected, and continue to adversely affect, the efficiency of our business operations. Also, the transition of the majority of our workforce to a remote work environment in response to COVID-19, as well as that of our third-party service providers, have exacerbated certain risks to our business, including, but not limited to, those associated with an increased demand for information technology resources, increased risk of cybersecurity attacks (including social engineering attacks), and increased risk of unauthorized dissemination of sensitive personal information or our proprietary or confidential information. As the pandemic continues to progress, we have observed an increase in cybersecurity incidents, predominantly ransomware and social engineering attacks, experienced by our third-party service providers. Further, government entities have also been the subject of cyberattacks. The EMA disclosed in December 2020 that it had been the subject of a cyberattack that targeted and accessed third-party documents relating to regulatory submissions, and that such documents were published on the internet (some of which were manipulated prior to publication). Such third-party and governmental incidents have created the risk of the loss of availability and/or control of information (including information related to our clinical trials) important to the operation of our business. See A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation. In the future, as the pandemic progresses and afterwards, we may experience significant adverse effects on our commercial and clinical manufacturing activities, our operations, and our cybersecurity, and our suppliers and vendors may also experience significant disruptions to their activities and operations on which we depend, as a result of these cybersecurity incidents. Federal, state and local, and international governmental policies and initiatives designed to reduce the transmission of COVID-19 also have resulted in the cancellation or delay of diagnostic, elective, specialty and other procedures and appointments to avoid non-essential patient exposure to medical environments and potential infection with COVID-19 and to focus limited resources and personnel capacity toward the treatment of COVID-19. These measures and challenges will likely continue to varying degrees for the duration of the pandemic and have significantly reduced patient access to, and administration of, certain of our drugs. For example, Prolia® is a product requiring administration by a healthcare provider in doctors’ offices or other healthcare settings that are affected by COVID-19. The U.S. label for Prolia® instructs healthcare professionals who discontinue Prolia® to transition the patient to an alternative antiresorptive, including oral treatments that do not require administration by a healthcare provider. Further, as a result of COVID-19, oncology patients, in consultation with their doctors, may be selecting less immunosuppressive therapies or therapies that do not require administration in a hospital setting, potentially adversely affecting certain of our products. Also, new patients are less likely to be diagnosed and/or to start therapeutics during the pandemic. Once the pandemic subsides, we anticipate there will be a substantial backlog of patients seeking appointments with physicians relating to a variety of medical conditions, and as a result, patients seeking treatment with certain of our products may have to navigate limited provider capacity, and this limited provider capacity could have a continued adverse effect on our sales following the opening up of various geographies and/or the end of the pandemic. Further, the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic may result in long-term shifts in preferences among healthcare professionals and patients toward treatments that do not require administration by healthcare professionals or visits to medical facilities. 30 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          The legislative and regulatory environment governing our businesses is dynamic and changing frequently in response to COVID-19. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs, such as the WHO’s COVID-19 Technology Access Pool initiative, which provides an approach for sharing all intellectual property, information and clinical trial data necessary to enable generic drug manufacturing. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. Further, the challenges of the pandemic have resulted in the exploration of signification legislation to address the need to supply medicines to address COVID-19. Pursuant to the declaration of a national emergency in the United States in March 2020 under the Stafford Act, state and local governments may request access to discounted pricing for certain items related to the COVID-19 response. The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security (CARES) Act implements initiatives to provide advanced payments from Medicare to healthcare providers, clinics and physicians and to require Medicare plans to provide up to a 90-day supply of Part D drugs. However, despite such initiatives and government support, there may be adverse effects on the timing and collectability of our customer receivables as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. See Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business. The COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in a significant increase in unemployment and underemployment which may continue after the pandemic. Such a significant increase in unemployment or other disruptions in the labor market have led to a substantial reduction in disposable income and, in the U.S., access to healthcare insurance, including reductions in the commercially insured population that has led to growth (and is expected to continue to lead to growth) in Medicaid enrollment, which has adversely affected our product sales. See Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Such reduction in healthcare insurance could be compounded by any full or partial repeal of the ACA by the U.S. Supreme Court. Further, globally, the substantial pressures placed on governmental and payor budgets as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic and the projected governmental budget shortfalls caused by significantly reduced economic activity during and potentially after the COVID-19 pandemic, together with the long-term impact from the pressures on healthcare systems, may result in greater and continued downward price pressure on biopharmaceutical products and increased intensity of stakeholder negotiations across the biopharmaceutical value chain. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As the pandemic continues, and if conditions worsen or if the duration of the pandemic extends significantly, we expect to experience additional adverse effects on our operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections of accounts receivable. It is unclear which adverse effects may be material, and it remains uncertain the degree to which these adverse effects would impact our future operational and commercial activities, customer purchases and our collections even if conditions begin to improve. There was a resurgence in COVID-19 infections in numerous jurisdictions in the autumn of 2020 and winter of 2020-2021, resulting in the reinstatement of stricter restrictions and shutdowns in a number of jurisdictions. It is expected that the pandemic will continue to ebb and flow, with different jurisdictions having higher levels of infections than others over the course of the pandemic. In addition to existing travel restrictions, jurisdictions may continue or reinstate border closures, impose or reimpose prolonged quarantines and further restrict travel and business activity, which could significantly affect our ability to support our operations and customers and the ability of our employees to get to their workplaces to discover, study, develop and produce our product candidates and products, disrupt the movement of our products through the supply chain, and prevent or discourage patients from seeking healthcare services and the administration of certain of our products. Further, in connection with the global outbreak and spread of COVID-19 and in an effort to increase the wider availability of needed medical products, we or our suppliers may elect to, or governments may require us or our suppliers to, allocate manufacturing capacity (for example pursuant to the U.S. Defense Production Act) in a way that adversely affects our regular operations, customer relationships and financial results. In the U.S., on January 21, 2021, President Biden issued an Executive Order instructing federal agencies to use all available legal authorities, including the Defense Production Act, to improve current and future pandemic response and biological threat preparedness. The rapid reallocation of resources for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19, including the production of COVID-19 vaccinations or related therapies, such as our agreement to contribute to the production of one of Lilly’s potential COVID-19 antibody therapies, could also result in increased competition for, or reduced availability of, materials used in the manufacturing or distribution of our products. In addition, unpredictable increases in demand for certain of our products could exceed our capacity to meet such demand, which could adversely affect our financial results and customer relationships. 31 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The COVID-19 pandemic and the volatile global economic conditions stemming from it may precipitate or amplify the other risks described in this “Risk Factors” section, which could materially adversely affect our business, operations and financial conditions and results. For example, if a natural disaster or other potentially disruptive event occurs concurrently with the COVID-19 pandemic, such disaster or event could deplete our inventory levels and we could experience a disruption to our manufacturing or ability to supply our products. Further, the global pandemic has exacerbated geopolitical tensions, and some countries, such as China, may be especially vulnerable to such dynamics. If relations between the United States and China or other governments deteriorates, our business and investments in China or other such markets may also be adversely affected. See Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. The rapid development and fluidity of the pandemic preclude any prediction as to the ultimate effect of COVID-19 on us. The duration of the measures being taken by the authorities to mitigate against the spread of COVID-19 (including the distribution of vaccines), and the extent to which such measures are effective, if at all, remain highly uncertain. The magnitude and degree of COVID-19’s adverse effect on our business (including our product development, product sales, operating results, and resulting cash flows) and financial condition will be driven by the severity and duration of the pandemic, the pandemic’s effect on the United States and global economies and the timing, scope and effectiveness of federal, state, local and international governmental responses to the pandemic. If the spread continues at or near its current trajectory or mitigation continues to require similar levels of shelter-in-place and shut-down orders, any adverse effects of COVID-19 will likely grow and could be enduring and our business and financial position could be materially adversely affected. A breakdown, cyberattack or information security breach could compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our information technology systems, network-connected control systems and/or our data, interrupt the operation of our business and/or affect our reputation. To achieve our business objectives, we rely on sophisticated information technology systems, including software, mobile applications, cloud services and network-connected control systems, some of which are managed, hosted, provided or serviced by third parties. Internal or external events that compromise the confidentiality, integrity and availability of our systems and data may significantly interrupt the operation of our business, result in significant costs and/or adversely affect our reputation. Our information technology systems are highly integrated into our business, including our R&D efforts, our clinical and commercial manufacturing processes and our product sales and distribution processes. Further, as the majority of our employees are working remotely, our reliance on our and third-party information technology systems has increased substantially and is expected to continue to increase. The complexity and interconnected nature of our systems makes them potentially vulnerable to breakdown or other service interruptions. Our systems are also subject to frequent cyberattacks. As the cyber-threat landscape evolves, these attacks are growing in frequency, sophistication and intensity and are becoming increasingly difficult to detect. Such attacks could include the use of harmful and virulent malware, including ransomware or other denials of service, that can be deployed through various means, including the software supply chain, e-mail, malicious websites and/or the use of social engineering. Attacks such as those experienced by governmental entities (including those that approve and/or regulate our products, such as the EMA) and other multi-national companies, including some of our peers, could leave us unable to utilize key business systems or access or protect important data, and could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate our business, including developing, gaining regulatory approval for, manufacturing, selling and/or distributing our products. For example, in 2017, a pharmaceutical company experienced a cyberattack involving virulent malware that significantly disrupted its operations, including its research and sales operations and the production of some of its medicines and vaccines. As a result of the cyberattack, its orders and sales for certain products in certain markets were negatively affected. In December 2020, SolarWinds Corporation, a leading provider of software for monitoring and managing information technology infrastructure, disclosed that it had suffered a cybersecurity incident whereby attackers had inserted malicious code into legitimate software updates for its products that were installed by myriad private and government customers, enabling the attackers to access a backdoor to such systems. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations for a discussion of the cyberattack on the EMA. Our systems also contain and utilize a high volume of sensitive data, including intellectual property, trade secrets, financial information, regulatory information, strategic plans, sales trends and forecasts, litigation materials and/or personal information belonging to us, our staff, our patients, customers and/or other parties. In some cases, we utilize third-party service providers to process, store, manage or transmit such data, which may increase our risk. Intentional or inadvertent data privacy or security breaches (including cyberattacks) or lapses by employees, service providers (including providers of information technology-specific services), nation states (including groups associated with or supported by foreign intelligence agencies), organized crime organizations, “hacktivists” or others, create risks that our sensitive data may be exposed to unauthorized persons, our competitors, or the public. 32 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Domestic and global government regulators, our business partners, suppliers with whom we do business, companies that provide us or our partners with business services and companies we may acquire may face similar risks, and security breaches of their systems could adversely affect our security, leave us without access to important systems, products, raw materials, components, services or information or expose our confidential data. For example, in 2019, two vendors that perform testing and analytical services that we use in developing and manufacturing our products have experienced cyberattacks, and in April and September of 2020, vendors that provide us with information technology services and clinical data services, respectively, each experienced ransomware attacks. Each of these incidents required us to disconnect our systems from those vendors’ systems. While we were able to reconnect our systems following restoration of these vendor’s capabilities without significantly affecting product availability, a more extended service outage affecting these or other vendors, particularly where such vendor is the single source from which we obtain the services, could have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. In addition, we distribute our products in the United States primarily through three pharmaceutical wholesalers, and a security breach that impairs the distribution operations of our wholesalers could significantly impair our ability to deliver our products to healthcare providers and patients. Although we have experienced system breakdowns, attacks and information security breaches, we do not believe such breakdowns, attacks and breaches have had a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations. We continue to invest in the monitoring, protection and resilience of our critical and/or sensitive data and systems. However, there can be no assurances that our efforts will detect, prevent or fully recover systems or data from all breakdowns, service interruptions, attacks, and/or breaches of our systems that could adversely affect our business and operations and/or result in the loss or exposure of critical, proprietary, private, confidential or otherwise sensitive data, which could result in material financial, legal, business or reputational harm to us or negatively affect our stock price. While we maintain cyber-liability insurance, our insurance is not sufficient to cover us against all losses that could potentially result from a service interruption, breach of our systems or loss of our critical or sensitive data. We are also subject to various laws and regulations globally regarding privacy and data protection, including laws and regulations relating to the collection, storage, handling, use, disclosure, transfer and security of personal data. The legislative and regulatory environment regarding privacy and data protection is continuously evolving and developing and the subject of significant attention globally. For example, we are subject to the EU’s GDPR, which became effective in May 2018, and the California Consumer Privacy Act of 2018, which became effective in January 2020, both of which provide for substantial penalties for non-compliance. Other jurisdictions where we operate have enacted or proposed similar legislation and/or regulations. Failure to comply with these current and future laws could result in significant penalties and could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. As we continue our expansion efforts in emerging markets around the world, through acquisitions and licensing transactions as well as through the development and introduction, both independently and through collaborations such as our collaboration with BeiGene, of our products in new markets, we face numerous risks to our business. There is no guarantee that our efforts and strategies to expand sales in emerging markets will succeed. Our international business, including in China and emerging market countries, may be especially vulnerable to periods of global and local political, legal, regulatory and financial instability, including issues of geopolitical relations, the imposition of international sanctions in response to certain state actions and/or sovereign debt issues. We may also be required to increase our reliance on third-party agents and unfamiliar operations and arrangements including those previously utilized by companies we partner with or acquire in emerging markets. See We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Our expansion efforts in China and emerging markets around the world is dependent upon the establishment of an environment that is predictable, navigable and supportive of biopharmaceutical innovation, sustained access for our products and limited pricing controls. For example, China continues to strengthen regulations on the collection, use and transmission of Chinese human genetic resources, and has expanded regulations on the conduct of biotechnology R&D activities in China. Our applications to the Human Genetic Resources Administration of China (HGRAC) seeking approval to conduct clinical trials in China are delayed pending further guidance from HGRAC. Our international operations and business may also be subject to less protective intellectual property or other applicable laws, diverse data privacy and protection requirements, changing tax laws and tariffs, trade restrictions or other barriers designed to protect industry in the home country against foreign competition, far-reaching antibribery and anticorruption laws and regulations and/or evolving legal and regulatory environments. 33 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As we expand internationally, we are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates relative to the U.S. dollar. While we have a program in place that is designed to reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations through foreign currency hedging arrangements, our hedging efforts do not completely offset the effect of these fluctuations on our revenues and earnings. In addition, we have a number of financial instruments referencing the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR). On July 27, 2017, the U.K Financial Conduct Authority, which regulates LIBOR, announced that it will no longer require banks to submit rates for the calculation of LIBOR to the LIBOR administrator after 2021, and it is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2023. In March 2020, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued a new accounting standard to ease the financial burdens of the expected market transition from LIBOR and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates. While various replacement reference rates have been proposed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted, and the specific mechanisms to replace LIBOR in our existing LIBOR-linked financial instruments have not been finalized. As such, the replacement of LIBOR could have an adverse effect on the market for, or value of, our LIBOR-linked financial instruments. See Part IV, Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies— Recent accounting pronouncements. We are also subject to the economic and political uncertainties stemming from the United Kingdom’s exit from the EU, commonly referred to as “Brexit,” which occurred on January 31, 2020. While our manufacturing and packaging activities take place largely outside the United Kingdom, minimizing the need to make costly and significant changes to those operations, we have nevertheless been working to put in place contingency plans to attempt to mitigate the effects of Brexit on us. Overall, the legal and operational challenges of our international business operations, along with government controls, the challenges of attracting and retaining qualified personnel and obtaining and/or maintaining necessary regulatory or pricing approvals of our products, may result in material adverse effects on our international product sales, business and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND THIRD-PARTY POLICIES Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Sales of our products depend on the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans. Governments and private payers continue to pursue initiatives to manage drug utilization and contain costs. These payers are increasingly focused on the effectiveness, benefits and costs of similar treatments, which could result in lower reimbursement rates for our products or narrower populations for whom payers will reimburse. Continued intense public scrutiny of the price of drugs and other healthcare costs, together with payer dynamics, have limited, and are likely to continue to limit, our ability to set or adjust the price of our products based on their value, which could have a material adverse effect on our business. In the United States, particularly over the past few years, a number of legislative and regulatory proposals have been introduced in an attempt to lower drug prices. These include proposals that would allow the U.S. government to negotiate drug price directly, limit drug reimbursement based on prices abroad or permit importation of drugs from Canada. Proposals focused on drug pricing are likely to continue to be proposed and may be adopted and implemented in some form. 34 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            —Changing U.S. federal coverage and reimbursement policies and practices have affected and may continue to affect access to, pricing and sales of our products A substantial portion of our U.S. business relies on reimbursement from federal government healthcare programs and commercial insurance plans regulated by federal and state governments. See Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. Our business has been and will continue to be affected by legislative actions changing U.S. federal reimbursement policy. Since late 2018, Congressional focus on drug pricing has increased, placing our industry under greater Congressional scrutiny. For example, in early 2019, the chair of the House Oversight and Reform Committee sent letters to twelve different biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, seeking documents and detailed information about such companies’ drug pricing practices. Subsequently, in the fall of 2020, the House Oversight and Reform Committee released staff reports and held hearings with executives from six biopharmaceutical manufacturers, including Amgen, about their companies’ drug pricing practices. Also, between 2019 and 2020, a number of other Congressional committees held hearings and evaluated proposed legislation on drug-pricing and payment policy. For example, in 2019, the Senate Finance Committee advanced a bill that would, among other things, penalize pharmaceutical manufacturers for raising prices on drugs covered by Medicare Parts B and/or D faster than the rate of inflation, cap out-of-pocket expenses for Medicare Part D beneficiaries, and require higher/additional manufacturer discounts in Medicare Part D. Additionally, in late 2019, a drug-pricing bill, H.R. 3, passed the House of Representatives, which would, among other things, enable direct price negotiations by the federal government on certain drugs (with the maximum price paid by Medicare capped by prices derived from an international index), includes a penalty for failing to reach agreement with the government, and requires that manufacturers offer these negotiated prices to other payers. We expect H.R. 3, or some similar proposed legislation, to be debated by Congress this year. Additional legislative or regulatory proposals have been introduced by members of Congress and the prior Administration that, if enacted and implemented in whole or in part, could also affect access to and sales of our products, including, but not limited to, proposals to allow importation of prescription medications from Canada or other countries and to set Medicare payment rates using international price referencing. Further, in mid-2020, the prior Administration announced a number of Executive Orders intended to reduce the cost of biopharmaceuticals for patients, including a MFN policy for Medicare Parts B and D, under which the HHS was directed to take steps to implement payment models that set Medicare purchase prices based on the lowest price available in economically comparable countries for certain Part B and Part D medicines. In September 2020, in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released a final rule to allow states (or other nonfederal government entities) to submit proposals to the FDA allowing for the importation of certain nonbiologic prescription drugs from Canada. Currently, the rule is being challenged by litigation, however, should such litigation be unsuccessful and should the Secretary of HHS authorize state proposals for importation, this rule could allow the importation of Canadian versions of certain of Amgen’s products (including Otezla®), that could have a material adverse effect on Amgen’s business. Further, in November 2020, also in response to the corresponding Executive Order, HHS released an interim final rule to implement the MFN pricing approach. If implemented, the MFN rule would set the reimbursement rate for 50 Medicare Part B drugs (including our products, such as Prolia®, XGEVA®, KYPROLIS®, Neulasta®, Nplate®, EPOGEN® and Aranesp®) equal to the lowest adjusted price for such products of the 22 Organization for Economic Co­operation and Development (OECD) nations. Lawsuits have been filed by certain trade groups challenging the implementation of this MFN rule based on, among other things, procedural defects. Late in 2020, in the case filed by the Biotechnology Industry Organization and others, the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California issued a preliminary injunction preventing the rule from taking effect nationwide, pending the government’s completion of required administrative procedures. The case was subsequently stayed by the court and the parties were ordered to file a joint status report by April 23, 2021. Another case, filed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America and others in the U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland, was also stayed. Notwithstanding these stays, the MFN rule’s approach to drug pricing and other similar approaches, remain of interest. Further, despite the change in Administration, we expect continued significant focus on healthcare and similar drug pricing proposals, including proposals similar to the MFN rule, for the foreseeable future. Our business has been, and is expected to continue to be, affected by changes in U.S. federal reimbursement policy resulting from federal regulations and federal demonstration projects. For example, the previous Administration released a drug pricing blueprint in 2018 which introduced an array of policy ideas intended to increase competition, improve the negotiating power of the federal government, reduce drug prices and lower patient out-of-pocket costs with the potential to significantly affect, whether individually or collectively, our industry. Such policy ideas included, but were not limited to, moving coverage and reimbursement for Medicare Part B drugs into Medicare Part D and instituting a competitive acquisition program for Part B drugs in which competing third-party vendors take on the financial risk of acquiring drugs and billing Medicare. 35 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Also, over the past three years, federal agencies, including the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS), announced a number of recommendations, policies, proposals and demonstration projects to implement various elements of the drug pricing blueprint. CMS is the federal agency responsible for administering Medicare and overseeing state Medicaid programs and Health Insurance Marketplaces and has substantial power to implement policy changes or demonstration projects that can quickly and significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. CMS issued guidance to allow certain Medicare plans offered by private insurance companies to require that patients receiving Medicare Part B drugs first try a drug preferred by the plan before covering another therapy (Step Therapy) and lowered reimbursement rates for new Medicare Part B drugs. Further, HHS issued a final rule under Medicare Part D revising the regulations under the federal antikickback statute to encourage PBMs to use rebates received from biopharmaceutical manufacturers to reduce patient cost-sharing at the point of sale. Changes to the regulations will be phased-in beginning on March 22, 2021, with all changes effective as of January 1, 2023. However, there are numerous logistical hurdles to overcome before such rule can be effectively implemented and it is unclear how PBMs will change their business practices in response. Furthermore, a trade association representing PBMs recently filed litigation challenging this HHS final rule. Given these uncertainties, it remains unclear when any anticipated benefits to patients will materialize. The incoming Administration also could develop and seek to advance a range of policy proposals that could impact U.S. federal reimbursement policy for drugs and biologics. CMS policy changes and demonstration projects to test new care, delivery and payment models can significantly affect how drugs, including our products, are covered and reimbursed. In end-stage renal disease (ESRD), CMS uses bundled payment rates. Between 2018 and 2020, Sensipar® and Parsabiv®, our calcimimetics that are used in dialysis clinics, were eligible for temporary drug add-on payment adjustments (TDAPA) to the bundled rate. In November 2020, CMS released its final rule ending the TDAPA for calcimimetics and adjusting ESRD Prospective Payment System bundled rates on January 1, 2021 by $9.93 per dialysis treatment for calcimimetics, and we expect the sales of our calcimimetics to be materially adversely affected by this rule change. Additionally, CMS created a new mandatory payment model effective January 1, 2021 focused on encouraging greater use of home dialysis and kidney transplants for ESRD patients that could result in changes to treatment of dialysis patients, including reduction of the use of our ESAs. Further, back in November 2019, CMS announced additional voluntary payment models for nephrologists and dialysis facility partners that also seek to encourage home dialysis and preemptive transplantation through increased risk sharing, but due to COVID-19, the start date of such programs has been pushed back to April 1, 2021. CMS has also solicited suggestions regarding other potential care models. In 2016, CMS initiated the Oncology Care Model demonstration, which provides participating physician practices with performance-based financial incentives that aim to manage or reduce Medicare costs without negatively affecting the efficacy of care, that has been extended by one year (to 2022) due to COVID-19. We believe the Oncology Care Model has reduced utilization of certain of our oncology products by participating physician practices and expect it to continue to do so in the future. Additionally, in late 2019, CMS announced a request for information on the Oncology Care First model, a new voluntary model that builds on the Oncology Care Model. CMS recently finalized a rule that, starting January 1, 2023, unless a manufacturer can ensure that the full amount of manufacturer patient assistance programs is passed on to the patient, such amount will be treated as a price reduction that will be taken into account when reporting our Best Price and/or Average Manufacturer Price (AMP). Given the use by PBMs and insurers of copay accumulator adjustment programs to apply such patient assistance for the benefit of such companies and not to defray costs to patients, it could be difficult to impossible for manufacturers to ensure that the full value of such amounts is being passed on to the patient. This new policy, if implemented, would have significant implications for our ability to offer copay assistance programs. In this dynamic environment, we are unable to predict which or how many federal policy, legislative, regulatory, executive or administrative changes may ultimately be, or effectively estimate the consequences to our business if, enacted and implemented. However, to the extent that these or other federal government initiatives further decrease or modify the coverage or reimbursement available for our products, require that we pay increased rebates or shift other costs to us, limit or affect our decisions regarding the pricing of or otherwise reduce the use of our U.S. products, or limit our ability to offer co-pay payment assistance to commercial patients, such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. We also face risks relating to the reporting of pricing data that affects the reimbursement of and discounts provided for our products. U.S. government price reporting regulations are complex and may require a biopharmaceutical manufacturer to update certain previously submitted data. If our submitted pricing data are incorrect, we may become subject to substantial fines and penalties or other government enforcement actions, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. In addition, as a result of restating previously reported price data, we also may be required to pay additional rebates and provide additional discounts. 36 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  —Changing reimbursement and pricing actions in various states have negatively affected, and may continue to negatively affect, access to, and have affected, and may continue to affect, sales of our products At the state level, government actions or ballot initiatives can also affect how our products are covered and reimbursed and/or create additional pressure on our pricing decisions. A number of states have adopted, and many other states are considering, drug importation programs or other new pricing actions, including proposals designed to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers publicly to report proprietary pricing information, limit price increases or place a maximum price ceiling or cap on biopharmaceutical products. Existing and proposed state pricing laws have added complexity to the pricing of drugs and may already be affecting industry pricing decisions. For example, a California law, the constitutionality of which is currently being challenged, purports to require biopharmaceutical manufacturers to notify health insurers and government health plans at least 60 days before scheduled prescription drug price increases that exceed certain thresholds. Similar laws exist in Oregon and Washington. States are also seeking to change the way they pay for drugs for patients covered by state programs. California adopted a 2020-21 budget that incorporates international pricing into Medicaid supplemental rebate negotiations and allows its Medicaid program to seek federal approval to extend supplemental rebates to non-Medicaid populations. New York, Massachusetts and Ohio have established Medicaid drug spending caps, and additional states may consider doing so as they face budget deficits from the effects of COVID-19. Additionally, Colorado, Florida, Maine, New Hampshire, New Mexico and Vermont have enacted laws, and several other states have proposed laws, to facilitate the importation of drugs from Canada. Other states could adopt similar approaches or could pursue different policy changes in a continuing effort to reduce their costs. Ultimately, as with U.S. federal government actions, existing or future state government actions or ballot initiatives may also have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. —U.S. commercial payer actions have affected and may continue to affect access to and sales of our products Payers, including healthcare insurers, PBMs, integrated healthcare delivery systems (vertically-integrated organizations built from the consolidation of healthcare insurers and PBMs) and group purchasing organizations, increasingly seek ways to reduce their costs. With increasing frequency, payers are adopting benefit plan changes that shift a greater proportion of drug costs to patients. Such measures include more limited benefit plan designs, high deductible plans, higher patient copay or coinsurance obligations and more significant limitations on patients’ use of manufacturer commercial copay assistance programs. Further, government regulation of payers may affect these trends. For example, CMS recently finalized a policy that could cause commercial payers to adopt copay accumulator adjustment programs more widely. Payers have sought, and will likely continue to seek, price discounts or rebates in connection with the placement of our products on their formularies or those they manage, particularly in treatment areas where the payer has taken the position that multiple branded products are therapeutically comparable. Payers also control costs by imposing restrictions on access to or usage of our products, such as Step Therapy, or requiring that patients receive the payer’s prior authorization before covering the product or that patients use a mail-order pharmacy or a limited network of payer fully-owned mail-order or specialty pharmacies. Payers may also choose to exclude certain indications for which our products are approved or even choose to exclude coverage entirely. For example, some payers require physicians to demonstrate or document that the patients for whom Repatha® has been prescribed meet payer utilization management criteria, and these requirements have limited, and may continue to limit, patient access to Repatha® treatment. In an effort to reduce barriers to access, we reduced the net price of Repatha® by providing greater discounts and rebates to payers, including PBMs that administer Medicare Part D prescription drug plans. However, affordability of patient out-of-pocket co-pay cost has limited and may continue to limit patient use. For example, in late 2018 and early 2019, in response to a very high percentage of Medicare patients abandoning their Repatha® prescriptions rather than pay their co-pay payment, we introduced a set of new National Drug Codes to make Repatha® available at a lower list price to attempt to address affordability for patients, particularly those on Medicare and on December 31, 2019, we discontinued the higher list price option for Repatha®. Despite these net and list price reductions, some payers have restricted, and may continue to restrict, patient access and may change formulary coverage for Repatha®, seek further discounts or rebates or take other actions that could reduce our sales of Repatha®. These factors have limited, and may continue to limit, patient affordability and use, and negatively affect Repatha® sales. 37 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Further, significant consolidation in the health insurance industry has resulted in a few large insurers and PBMs, which places greater pressure on pricing and usage negotiations with biopharmaceutical manufacturers, significantly increasing discount and rebate requirements and limiting patient access and usage. For example, in the United States, in 2020, the top five integrated health plans and PBMs controlled about 85% of all pharmacy prescriptions. The consolidation among insurers, PBMs and other payers, including through integrated healthcare delivery systems and/or with specialty or mail-order pharmacies and pharmacy retailers, has increased the negotiating leverage such entities have over us and other biopharmaceutical manufacturers, and has resulted in greater price discounts, rebates and service fees realized by those payers. In 2019 and 2020, CVS and Express Scripts created Rebate Management Organizations that further increase their respective leverage to negotiate deeper discounts. Ultimately, additional discounts, rebates, fees, coverage or plan changes, restrictions or exclusions imposed by these commercial payers could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Policy reforms advanced by Congress or the Administration that refine the role of PBMs in the U.S. marketplace could have downstream implications or consequences for our business and how we interact with these entities. —Government and commercial payer actions outside the United States have affected and will continue to affect access to and sales of our products Outside the United States, we expect countries will also continue to take actions to reduce their drug expenditures. See Item 1. Business—Reimbursement. IRP has been widely used by many countries outside the United States to control costs based on an external benchmark of a product’s price in other countries. IRP policies can change quickly and frequently and may not reflect differences in the burden of disease, indications, market structures, or affordability differences across countries or regions. In addition, countries may refuse to reimburse or may restrict the reimbursed population for a product when their national health technology assessments do not consider a medicine to demonstrate sufficient clinical benefit beyond existing therapies or to meet certain cost effectiveness thresholds. For example, despite the EMA’s approval of Repatha® for the treatment of patients with established atherosclerotic disease, the reimbursement for Repatha® in France is limited to a narrower patient population (such as those with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia) following a national health technology assessment. While the pricing and reimbursement process in that country remains ongoing, the assessment currently limits our efforts in France to expand Repatha® access to the broader patient population covered by the approved label. Some countries decide on reimbursement between potentially competing products through national or regional tenders that often result in one product receiving most or all of the sales in that country or region. Failure to obtain coverage and reimbursement for our products, a deterioration in their existing coverage and reimbursement, or a decline in the timeliness or certainty of payment by payers to physicians and other providers has negatively affected, and may further negatively affect, the ability or willingness of healthcare providers to prescribe our products for their patients and otherwise negatively affect the use of our products or the prices we realize for them. Such changes have had, and could in the future have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Guidelines and recommendations published by various organizations can reduce the use of our products. Government agencies promulgate regulations and guidelines directly applicable to us and to our products. Professional societies, practice management groups, insurance carriers, physicians’ groups, private health and science foundations and organizations involved in various diseases also publish guidelines and recommendations to healthcare providers, administrators and payers, as well as patient communities. Recommendations by government agencies or other groups and organizations may relate to such matters as usage, dosage, route of administration and use of related therapies. In addition, a growing number of organizations are providing assessments of the value and pricing of biopharmaceutical products, and even organizations whose guidelines have historically been focused on clinical matters have begun to incorporate analyses of the cost effectiveness of various treatments into their treatment guidelines and recommendations. Value assessments may come from private organizations that publish their findings and offer recommendations relating to the products’ reimbursement by government and private payers. Some companies and payers have announced pricing and payment decisions based in part on the assessments of private organizations. In addition, government health technology assessment organizations in many countries make reimbursement recommendations to payers in their jurisdictions based on the clinical effectiveness, cost-effectiveness and service effects of new, emerging and existing medicines and treatments. Such health technology assessment organizations have recommended, and may in the future recommend, reimbursement for certain of our products for a narrower indication than was approved by applicable regulatory agencies or may recommend against reimbursement entirely. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from government and commercial third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures have affected, and are likely to continue to affect, our profitability. Such recommendations or guidelines may affect our reputation, and any recommendations or guidelines that result in decreased use, dosage or reimbursement of our products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, the perception by the investment community or stockholders that such recommendations or guidelines will result in decreased use and dosage of our products could adversely affect the market price of our common stock. 38 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. We are subject to income and other taxes in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business. As a result, our provision for income taxes is derived from a combination of applicable tax rates in the various places we operate. Significant judgment is required for determining our provision for income tax. Our tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in the United States and other jurisdictions in which we do business, and a number of audits are currently underway. Tax authorities, including the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), are becoming more aggressive in their audits and are particularly focused on the allocations of income and expense among tax jurisdictions. In 2017, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. However, we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process. In addition, in 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagree with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. The IRS audit for years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term. We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Our provision for income taxes and results of operations in the future could be adversely affected by changes to our operating structure, changes in the mix of income and expenses in countries with differing tax rates, changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities and changes in applicable tax laws, regulations or administrative interpretations thereof. The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the 2017 Tax Act) is complex and a large volume of regulations and guidance has been issued and could be subject to different interpretations. We could face audit challenges to our application of the 2017 Tax Act. The new Administration and Congress could make changes to existing tax law, including an increase in the corporate tax rate and the tax rate on foreign earnings. Changes to existing tax law in the U.S., the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, or other jurisdictions, including efforts by the OECD to align countries on corporate tax matters that would likely result in tax increases where we do business could have a material adverse effect on the results of our operations. Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We and certain of our subsidiaries are involved in legal proceedings. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Civil and criminal litigation is inherently unpredictable, and the outcome can result in costly verdicts, fines and penalties, exclusion from federal healthcare programs and/or injunctive relief that affect how we operate our business. Defense of litigation claims can be expensive, time consuming and distracting, and it is possible that we could incur judgments or enter into settlements of claims for monetary damages or change the way we operate our business, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, product liability is a major risk in testing and marketing biotechnology and pharmaceutical products. We may face substantial product liability exposure in human clinical trials and for products we sell after regulatory approval. Product liability claims, regardless of their merits, could be costly and divert management’s attention and could adversely affect our reputation and the demand for our products. We and certain of our subsidiaries have previously been named as defendants in product liability actions for certain of our products. 39 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    We are also involved in government investigations that arise in the ordinary course of our business. In recent years, there has been a trend of increasing government investigations and litigations against companies operating in our industry, both in the United States and around the world. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. Our business activities outside of the United States are subject to the FCPA and similar antibribery or anticorruption laws, regulations or rules of other countries in which we operate, including the UK Bribery Act. We cannot ensure that all our employees, agents, contractors, vendors, licensees, partners or collaborators will comply with all applicable laws and regulations. On April 25, 2019, we entered into a settlement agreement with the DOJ and the OIG of the HHS to settle certain allegations relating to our support of independent charitable organizations that provide patients with financial assistance to access their medicines. As a result, we entered into a corporate integrity agreement with the OIG that requires us to maintain a corporate compliance program and to undertake a set of defined corporate integrity obligations for a period of five years. While we expect to fully comply with all of our obligations under the corporate integrity agreement, failure to do so could result in substantial penalties and potential exclusion from government healthcare programs. We may also see new government investigations of or actions against us citing novel theories of recovery. For example, prosecutors are placing greater scrutiny on patient support programs, including commercial copay assistance programs, and further enforcement actions and investigations regarding such programs could limit our ability to provide co-pay assistance to commercial patients. Greater scrutiny has also been placed on sponsorships, speaker programs and other arrangements where healthcare professionals receive remuneration, travel or other value to participate in certain events, and further enforcement actions could limit our ability to participate in such arrangements. Any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. RISKS RELATED TO COMPETITION Our products face substantial competition and our product candidates are also likely to face substantial competition. We operate in a highly competitive environment. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We expect that our products and product candidates will compete with existing drugs, new drugs currently in development, drugs currently approved for other indications that may later be approved for the same indications as those of our products and drugs approved for other indications that are used off-label. Large pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers of pharmaceutical products are expanding into the biotechnology field, and some pharmaceutical companies and generics manufacturers have formed partnerships to pursue biosimilars. With the proliferation of companies pursuing biopharmaceuticals, a number of our product candidates may enter markets with one or more competitors or with competitors soon to arrive. In addition, some of our competitors may have technical, competitive or other advantages over us for the development of technologies and processes or greater experience in particular therapeutic areas, and consolidation among pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can enhance such advantages. These advantages may make it difficult for us to compete with them successfully to discover, develop and market new products and for our current products to compete with new products or new product indications they may bring to market. As a result, our products have been competing and may continue to compete, and our product candidates may compete, against products or product candidates that offer higher rebates or discounts, lower prices, equivalent or superior efficacy, better safety profiles, easier administration, earlier market availability or other competitive features. If we are unable to compete effectively, this could reduce sales, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. 40 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. Our success depends in part on our ability to obtain and defend patent rights and other intellectual property rights that are important to the commercialization of our products and product candidates. The patent positions of pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies can be highly uncertain and often involve complex legal, scientific and factual questions. Driven by cost pressures, efforts to limit or weaken patent protection for our industry are increasing. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in increased interest in compulsory licenses, march-in rights or other governmental interventions, both in the United States and internationally, related to the procurement of drugs. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Third parties have challenged and may continue to challenge, invalidate or circumvent our patents and patent applications relating to our products, product candidates and technologies. Challenges to patents may come from potential competitors or from parties other than those who seek to market a potentially-infringing product. In addition, our patent positions might not protect us against competitors with similar products or technologies because competing products or technologies may not infringe our patents. For certain of our product candidates, there are third parties who have patents or pending patent applications that they may claim necessitate payment of a royalty or prevent us from commercializing these product candidates in certain territories. Patent disputes are frequent, costly and can preclude, delay or increase the cost of commercialization of products. We have been in the past, are currently and expect to be in the future, involved in patent litigation. These matters have included, and may in the future include, litigation with manufacturers of products that purport to be biosimilars of certain of our products for patent infringement and for failure to comply with certain provisions of the Biologics Price Competition and Innovation Act of 2009 (BPCIA). A determination made by a court, agency or tribunal concerning infringement, validity, enforceability, injunctive or economic remedy, or the right to patent protection, for example, are typically subject to appellate or administrative review. Upon review, such initial determinations may be afforded little or no deference by the reviewing tribunal and may be affirmed, reversed or made the subject of reconsideration through further proceedings. A patent dispute or litigation has not discouraged, and may not in the future discourage, a potential violator from bringing the allegedly-infringing product to market prior to a final resolution of the dispute or litigation. The period from inception until resolution of a patent dispute or litigation is subject to the availability and schedule of the court, agency or tribunal before which the dispute or litigation is pending. We have been, and may in the future be, subject to competition during this period and may not be able to recover fully from the losses, damages and harms we incur from infringement by the competitor product even if we prevail. Moreover, if we lose or settle current or future litigations at certain stages or entirely, we could be subject to competition and/or significant liabilities, be required to enter into third-party licenses for the infringed product or technology or be required to cease using the technology or product in dispute. In addition, we cannot guarantee that such licenses will be available on terms acceptable to us, or at all. Further, under the Hatch-Waxman Act, our products approved by the FDA under the FDCA have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation with generics competitors before expiry of the five-year period of data exclusivity provided for under the Hatch-Waxman Act and prior to the expiration of the patents listed for the product. Likewise, our innovative biologic products have been, and may in the future be, the subject of patent litigation prior to the expiration of our patents and, with respect to competitors seeking approval as a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our products, prior to the 12-year exclusivity period provided under the BPCIA. In addition, we may face patent litigation involving claims that the biosimilar product candidates we are working to develop infringe the patents of other companies, including those that manufacture, market or sell the applicable reference products or who are developing or have developed other biosimilar versions of such products. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there may be delays in ongoing or new patent office or court proceedings in the U.S. or abroad that may delay the outcome of such proceedings. While we have attempted, and expect to continue to attempt, to challenge the patents held by other companies, our efforts may be unsuccessful. Alternatively, such patents have contributed, and may in the future contribute, to a decision by us to not pursue all of the same labeled indications as are held by these companies. For examples of and information related to our patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Certain of the existing patents on our products have expired. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents. As our patents expire, competitors are able to legally produce and market similar products or technologies, including biosimilars, which has had, and may continue to have, a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In addition, competitors have been, and may continue to be, able to invalidate, design around or otherwise circumvent our patents and sell competing products. 41 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics in most of the territories in which we operate, including Europe and the United States, and we expect to face increasing biosimilar and/or generics competition this year and beyond. Expiration or successful challenge of applicable patent rights or expiration of an applicable exclusivity period has accelerated such competition, and we expect to face more litigation regarding the validity and/or scope of our patents. Our products have also experienced greater competition from lower cost biosimilars or generics that come to market when branded products that compete with our products lose their own patent protection. To the extent that governments adopt more permissive regulatory approval standards and competitors are able to obtain broader or expedited marketing approval for biosimilars and generics, the rate of increased competition for our products could accelerate. In the EU, biosimilars are evaluated for marketing authorization pursuant to a set of general and product class-specific guidelines. In addition, in an effort to spur biosimilar utilization and/or increase potential healthcare savings, some EU countries and some Canadian provinces have adopted or are considering the adoption of biosimilar uptake measures such as physician prescribing quotas or automatic pharmacy substitution of biosimilars for the corresponding reference products. Some EU countries impose automatic price reductions upon market entry of one or more biosimilar competitors. While the degree of competitive effects of biosimilar competition differs between EU countries and between products, in the EU the overall use of biosimilars and the rate at which product sales of innovative products are being affected by biosimilar competition is increasing. In the United States, the BPCIA authorizes the FDA to approve biosimilars via a separate, abbreviated pathway. See Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Regulation in the United States—Approval of Biosimilars. The first biosimilar entrant into the U.S. market was Sandoz’s Zarxio® (filgrastim-sndz), a biosimilar version of NEUPOGEN®, in 2015. Since then, the FDA has approved additional biosimilars, including biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, EPOGEN® and ENBREL, and a growing number of companies have announced that they are also developing biosimilar versions of our products. Four biosimilar versions of Neulasta® are now marketed in the United States, and we expect other biosimilar versions of Neulasta® to receive approval in 2021 and beyond. Impact to our Neulasta® sales has accelerated as additional competitors have launched. See Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. An approved biosimilar version of EPOGEN® has also launched in the United States, and we are currently involved in patent litigations with the manufacturers of the approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. Manufacturers of biosimilars have attempted, and may in the future attempt, to compete with our products by offering lower list prices, greater discounts or rebates, or contracts that offer longer-term pricing or a broader portfolio of other products. Companies pursuing development of biosimilar versions of our products have challenged and may continue to challenge our patents well in advance of the expiration of our material patents. For example, we recently successfully defended our ENBREL patents against a litigation challenge. For examples of and information related to our biosimilars and generics patent litigation, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. See Our intellectual property positions may be challenged, invalidated or circumvented, or we may fail to prevail in current and future intellectual property litigation. The U.S. pathway includes the option for biosimilar products that meet certain criteria to be approved as interchangeable with their reference products. Some companies currently developing or already marketing biosimilars may seek to obtain interchangeable status from the FDA, which could potentially allow pharmacists to substitute those biosimilars for our reference products without prior approval from the prescriber in most states. In November 2019, the FDA issued draft guidance that provides that comparative immunogenicity studies will not generally be expected for biosimilar and interchangeable insulin products. This may open the door for other product-specific guidance development and the removal of the expectation for certain studies, which may contribute to increased biosimilar competition for our innovative products. In addition, critics of the 12-year exclusivity period in the biosimilar pathway law will likely continue to seek to shorten the data exclusivity period and/or to encourage the FDA to interpret narrowly the law’s provisions regarding which new products receive data exclusivity. In late 2019, the previous Administration agreed to remove from the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement a requirement for at least 10 years of data exclusivity for biologic products. Also, the FDA is considering whether subsequent changes to a licensed biologic would be protected by the remainder of the reference product’s original 12­year exclusivity period (a concept known in the generic drug context as “umbrella exclusivity”). If the FDA were to decide that umbrella exclusivity does not apply to biological reference products or were to make other changes to the exclusivity period, this could expose us to biosimilar competition at an earlier time. There also have been, and may continue to be, legislative and regulatory efforts to promote competition through policies enabling easier generic and biosimilar approval and commercialization, including efforts to lower standards for demonstrating biosimilarity or interchangeability, limit patents that may be litigated and/or patent settlements, implement preferential reimbursement policies for biosimilars and passage of new laws requiring more disclosure in the FDA’s Orange and Purple Books. 42 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Upon the expiration or loss of patent protection and/or applicable exclusivity for one of our small molecule products, we can lose the majority of revenues for that product in a very short period of time.

Additionally, if one of our small molecule products is the subject of an FDA Written Request for pediatric studies and we are unable to adequately complete these studies, we may not obtain the pediatric exclusivity award that extends existing patents for the product by an additional six months. For example, as a result of the product already introduced and/or that could further be introduced into the U.S. market, our product sales for Sensipar® have been adversely affected and could be further materially and adversely affected by competing generics. California is the first state to have passed legislation, effective on January 1, 2020, against “pay for delay” settlements of patent infringement claims filed by manufacturers of generics or biosimilars where anything of value is given in exchange for settlement. Under this law, such settlement agreements are presumptively anticompetitive. The law may result in prolonged litigation and fewer settlements. Other states, including Connecticut, New York, Illinois, and Minnesota, may adopt similar laws or a similar law could be adopted at the federal level. While we are unable to predict the precise effects of biosimilars and generics on our products, we are currently facing and expect to face greater competition in the United States, Europe and elsewhere in 2021 and beyond as a result of biosimilar and generic competition and, in turn, downward pressure on our product prices and sales. This competition has had and could increasingly have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Concentration of sales at certain of our wholesaler distributors and at one free-standing dialysis clinic business and consolidation of private payers may negatively affect our business. Certain of our distributors, customers and payers have substantial purchasing leverage, due to the volume of our products they purchase or the number of patient lives for which they provide coverage. The substantial majority of our U.S. product sales is made to three pharmaceutical product wholesaler distributors: AmerisourceBergen, McKesson and Cardinal Health. These distributors, in turn, sell our products to their customers, which include physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. One of our products, EPOGEN®, is sold primarily to free-standing dialysis clinics. DaVita owns or manages a large number of the outpatient dialysis facilities located in the United States and accounts for approximately 90% of all EPOGEN® sales. Similarly, as discussed above, there has been significant consolidation in the health insurance industry, including that a small number of PBMs now oversee a substantial percentage of total covered lives in the United States. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. The three largest PBMs in the United States are now part of major health insurance providers. The growing concentration of purchasing and negotiating power by these entities may put pressure on our pricing due to their ability to extract price discounts on our products, fees for other services or rebates, negatively affecting our bargaining position, sales and/or profit margins. In addition, decisions by these entities to purchase or cover less or none of our products in favor of competitive products could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations due to their purchasing volume. Further, if one of our significant wholesale distributors encounters financial or other difficulties and becomes unable or unwilling to pay us all amounts that such distributor owes us on a timely basis, or at all, it could negatively affect our business and results of operations. In addition, if one of our significant wholesale distributors becomes insolvent or otherwise unable to continue its commercial relationship with us in its present form, it could significantly disrupt our business and adversely affect our product sales, our business and results of operations unless suitable alternatives are timely found or lost sales are absorbed by another distributor. RISKS RELATED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT We may not be able to develop commercial products despite significant investments in R&D. Amgen invests heavily in R&D. Successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain, and very few R&D projects produce commercial products. Product candidates, including biosimilar product candidates, or new indications for existing products (collectively, product candidates) that appear promising in the early phases of development may fail to reach the market for a number of reasons, such as: • the product candidate did not demonstrate acceptable clinical trial results even though it achieved its primary endpoints and/or demonstrated positive preclinical or early clinical trial results, for reasons that could include changes in the standard of care of medicine or expectations of health authorities; • the product candidate was not effective or not more effective than currently available therapies in treating a specified condition or illness; • the product candidate was not cost effective in light of existing therapeutics; • the product candidate had harmful side effects in animals or humans; 43 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                • the necessary regulatory bodies, such as the FDA or EMA, did not approve the product candidate for an intended use; • the product candidate was not economical for us to manufacture and commercialize; • other parties had or may have had proprietary rights relating to our product candidate, such as patent rights, and did not let us sell it on reasonable terms, or at all; • we and certain of our licensees, partners, contracted organizations or independent investigators may have failed to effectively conduct clinical development or clinical manufacturing activities; • the pathway to regulatory approval or reimbursement for product candidates was uncertain or not well-defined; • the biosimilar product candidate failed to demonstrate the requisite biosimilarity to the applicable reference product, or was otherwise determined by a regulatory authority to not meet applicable standards for approval; and • a companion diagnostic device that is required with the use of a product candidate is not approved by the necessary regulatory authority. We have spent considerable time, energy and resources developing our expertise in human genetics and acquiring access to libraries of genetic information with the belief that genetics could meaningfully aid our search for new medicines and help guide our R&D decisions and investments. We have focused our R&D strategy on drug targets validated by genetic or other compelling human evidence. However, product candidates based on genetically validated targets remain subject to the uncertainties of the drug development process and may not reach the market for a number of reasons, including the factors listed above. A number of our product candidates have failed or been discontinued at various stages in the product development process. For example, in 2015, we terminated our participation in the co-development and commercialization of brodalumab, a product candidate that was in phase 3, with AstraZeneca. The decision was based on events of suicidal ideation and behavior in the brodalumab program that occurred late in the development program, which we believed likely would necessitate restrictive labeling that would limit the appropriate patient population. Inability to bring a product to market or a significant delay in the expected approval and related launch date of a new product for any of the reasons discussed could potentially have a negative effect on our product sales and earnings and could result in a significant impairment of in-process research and development (IPR&D) or other intangible assets. We must conduct clinical trials in humans before we commercialize and sell any of our product candidates or existing products for new indications. Before we sell any products, we must conduct clinical trials to demonstrate that our product candidates are safe and effective for use in humans. The results of those clinical trials are used as the basis to obtain approval from regulatory authorities such as the FDA and EMA. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. We are required to conduct clinical trials using an appropriate number of trial sites and patients to support the product label claims. The length of time, number of trial sites and number of patients required for clinical trials vary substantially, and we may spend several years and incur substantial expense in completing certain clinical trials. In addition, we may have difficulty finding a sufficient number of clinical trial sites and patients to participate in our clinical trials, particularly if competitors are conducting clinical trials in similar patient populations. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. Patients may withdraw from clinical trials at any time, and privacy laws and/or other restrictions in certain countries may restrict the ability of clinical trial investigators to conduct further follow-up on such patients, which may adversely affect the interpretation of study results. Delays and complications in planned clinical trials can result in increased development costs, associated delays in regulatory approvals and in product candidates reaching the market and revisions to existing product labels. 44 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Further, to increase the number of patients available for enrollment in our clinical trials, we have opened, and will continue to open, clinical sites and enroll patients in a number of locations where our experience conducting clinical trials is more limited, including Russia, India, China, South Korea, the Philippines, Singapore and some Central and South American countries, either through utilization of third-party contract clinical trial providers entirely or in combination with local staff. Conducting clinical trials in locations where we have limited experience requires substantial time and resources to understand the unique regulatory environments of individual countries. For other examples of the risks of conducting clinical trials in China, see also Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. Further, we must ensure the timely production, distribution and delivery of the clinical supply of our product candidates to numerous and varied clinical trial sites. Additionally, regional disruptions, including natural and man-made disasters or health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19), could significantly disrupt the timing of clinical trials. If we fail to adequately manage the design, execution and diverse regulatory aspects of our large and/or complex clinical trials or to manage the production or distribution of our clinical supply, or such sites experience disruptions as a result of a natural/man-made disaster or health emergency, corresponding regulatory approvals may be delayed or we may fail to gain approval for our product candidates or could lose our ability to market existing products in certain therapeutic areas or altogether. For example, our clinical trials have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. See The COVID-19 pandemic, and the public and governmental effort to mitigate against the spread of the disease, have had, and are expected to continue to have, an adverse effect, and may have a material adverse effect, on our clinical trials, operations, supply chains, distribution systems, product development, product sales, business and results of operations. If we are unable to market and sell our products or product candidates or to obtain approvals in the timeframe needed to execute our product strategies, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. We rely on independent third-party clinical investigators to recruit patients and conduct clinical trials on our behalf in accordance with applicable study protocols, laws and regulations. Further, we rely on unaffiliated third-party vendors to perform certain aspects of our clinical trial operations. In some circumstances, we enter into co-development arrangements with other pharmaceutical and medical devices companies that provide for the other company to conduct certain clinical trials for the product we are co-developing or to develop a diagnostic test used in screening or monitoring patients in our clinical trials. See Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and of our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We also may acquire companies that have past or ongoing clinical trials or rights to products or product candidates for which clinical trials have been or are being conducted. These trials may not have been conducted to the same standards as ours; however, once an acquisition has been completed we assume responsibility for the conduct of these trials, including any potential risks and liabilities associated with the past and prospective conduct of those trials. If regulatory authorities determine that we or others, including our licensees or co-development partners, or the independent investigators or vendors selected by us, our co-development partners or by a company we have acquired or from which we have acquired rights to a product or product candidate, have not complied with regulations applicable to the clinical trials, those authorities may refuse or reject some or all of the clinical trial data or take other actions that could delay or otherwise negatively affect our ability to obtain or maintain marketing approval of the product or indication. In addition, delays or failures to develop diagnostic tests for our clinical trials can affect the timely enrollment of such trials and lead to delays or inability to obtain marketing approval. If we were unable to market and sell our products or product candidates, our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. In addition, some of our clinical trials utilize drugs manufactured and marketed by other pharmaceutical companies. These drugs may be administered in clinical trials in combination with one of our products or product candidates or in a head-to-head study comparing the products’ or product candidates’ relative efficacy and safety. In the event that any of these vendors or pharmaceutical companies have unforeseen issues that negatively affect the quality of their work product or create a shortage of supply, or if we are otherwise unable to obtain an adequate supply of these other drugs, our ability to complete our applicable clinical trials and/or evaluate clinical results may also be negatively affected. As a result, such quality or supply problems could adversely affect our ability to timely file for, gain or maintain regulatory approvals worldwide. Clinical trials must generally be designed based on the current standard of medical care. However, in certain diseases, such as cancer, the standard of care is evolving rapidly. In some cases, we may design a clinical trial based on the standard of care we anticipate will exist at the time our study is completed. The duration of time needed to complete certain clinical trials may result in the design of such clinical trials being based on standards of medical care that are no longer or that have not become the current standards by the time such trials are completed, limiting the utility and application of such trials. Additionally, the views of regulatory agencies relating to the requirements for accelerated approval may change over time, and trial designs that were sufficient to support accelerated approvals for some oncology products may not be considered sufficient for later candidates. We may not obtain favorable clinical trial results and therefore may not be able to obtain regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products and/or maintain our current product labels. Participants in clinical trials of our products and product candidates may also suffer adverse medical events or side effects that could, among other factors, delay or terminate clinical trial programs and/or require additional or longer trials to gain approval. 45 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Even after a product is on the market, safety concerns may require additional or more extensive clinical trials as part of a risk management plan for our product or for approval of a new indication. For example, in connection with the June 2011 ESA label changes, we agreed to and conducted additional clinical trials examining the use of ESAs in CKD. Additional clinical trials we initiate, including those required by the FDA, could result in substantial additional expense, and the outcomes could result in further label restrictions or the loss of regulatory approval for an approved indication, each of which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Additionally, any negative results from such trials could materially affect the extent of approvals, the use, reimbursement and sales of our products, our business and results of operations. Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Our business is subject to extensive regulation by numerous state and federal government authorities in the United States, including the FDA, and by foreign regulatory authorities, including the EMA. We are required in the United States and in foreign countries to obtain approval from regulatory authorities before we manufacture, market and sell our products. Once our products are approved, the FDA and other U.S. and foreign regulatory agencies have substantial authority to require additional testing and reporting, perform inspections, change product labeling or mandate withdrawals of our products. Failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements may subject us to administrative and/or judicially imposed sanctions or monetary penalties as well as reputational and other harms. The sanctions could include the FDA’s or foreign regulatory authorities’ refusals to approve pending applications, delays in obtaining or withdrawals of approvals, delays or suspensions of clinical trials, warning letters, product recalls or seizures, total or partial suspensions of our operations, injunctions, fines, civil penalties and/or criminal prosecutions. Obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals have been, and will continue to be, increasingly difficult, time-consuming and costly. Legislative bodies or regulatory agencies could enact new laws or regulations, change existing laws or regulations or change their interpretations of laws or regulations at any time, which could affect our ability to obtain or maintain approval of our products or product candidates. The rate and degree of change in existing laws and regulations and regulatory expectations have accelerated in established markets, and regulatory expectations continue to evolve in emerging markets. We are unable to predict whether and when any further changes to laws or regulatory policies affecting our business could occur, such as changes to laws or regulations governing manufacturer communications concerning drug products and drug product candidates and whether such changes could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. In the United States, a partial federal government shutdown halted the work of many federal agencies and their employees from late December 2018 through late January 2019. A subsequent extended shutdown could result in reductions or delays of FDA’s activities, including with respect to our ongoing clinical programs, our manufacturing of our products and product candidates and our product approvals. Regulatory authorities have questioned, and may in the future question, the sufficiency for approval of the endpoints we select for our clinical trials. A number of our products and product candidates have been evaluated in clinical trials using surrogate endpoints that measure an effect that is known to correlate with an ultimate clinical benefit. For example, a therapeutic oncology product candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce or eliminate minimal residual disease (MRD), or to extend the length of time during and after the treatment that a patient lives without the disease worsening, measured by PFS. Demonstrating that the product candidate induces MRD-negative responses or produces a statistically significant improvement in PFS does not necessarily mean that the product candidate will show a statistically significant improvement in overall survival or the time that the patients remain alive. In the CV setting, a heart disease therapeutic candidate may be evaluated for its ability to reduce LDL-C levels, as an elevated LDL-C level has been a surrogate endpoint for CV events such as death, heart attack and stroke. The use of surrogate endpoints such as PFS and LDL-C reduction, in the absence of other measures of clinical benefit, may not be sufficient for broad usage or approval even when such results are statistically significant. Regulatory authorities could also add new requirements, such as the completion of enrollment in a confirmatory study or the completion of an outcomes study or a meaningful portion of an outcomes study, as conditions for obtaining approval or obtaining an indication. For example, despite demonstrating that Repatha® reduced LDL-C levels in a broad patient population, only after our large phase 3 outcomes study evaluating the ability of Repatha® to prevent CV events met certain of its primary composite endpoint and key secondary composite endpoint did the FDA grant a broader approval of Repatha® to reduce the risk of certain CV events, and also to be used, alone or in combination with other lipid-lowering therapies, for the treatment of adults with primary hyperlipidemia to reduce LDL-C. There may also be situations in which demonstrating the efficacy and safety of a product candidate may not be sufficient to gain regulatory approval unless superiority to other existing treatment options can be shown. The imposition of additional requirements or our inability to meet them in a timely fashion, or at all, has delayed, and may in the future delay, our clinical development and regulatory filing efforts, delay or prevent us from obtaining regulatory approval for new product candidates or new indications for existing products, or prevent us from maintaining our current product labels. 46 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    Some of our products have been approved by U.S. and foreign regulatory authorities on an accelerated or conditional basis with full approval conditioned upon fulfilling the requirements of regulators. For example, in March 2018, we announced that the FDA approved BLINCYTO® under accelerated approval for the treatment of adults and children with B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in first or second complete remission with MRD greater than or equal to 0.1 percent. Continued approval for this indication may be contingent upon verification and description of clinical benefit in confirmatory trials. Regulatory authorities are placing greater focus on monitoring products originally approved on an accelerated or conditional basis and on whether the sponsors of such products have met the conditions of the accelerated or conditional approvals. If we are unable to fulfill the regulators’ requirements that were conditions of a product’s accelerated or conditional approval and/or if regulators reevaluate the data or risk-benefit profile of our product, the conditional approval may not result in full approval or may be revoked or not renewed. Alternatively, we may be required to change the product’s labeled indications or even withdraw the product from the market. Regulatory authorities can also impose post-marketing pediatric study requirements. Failure to fulfill such requirements may result in regulatory or enforcement action, including financial penalties or the invalidation of a product’s marketing authorization. Safety problems or signals can arise as our products and product candidates are evaluated in clinical trials, including investigator sponsored studies, or as our marketed products are used in clinical practice. We are required continuously to collect and assess adverse events reported to us and to communicate to regulatory agencies these adverse events and safety signals regarding our products. Regulatory agencies periodically perform inspections of our pharmacovigilance processes, including our adverse event reporting. In the United States, for our products with approved REMS (see Item 1. Business—Government Regulation—Postapproval Phase), we are required to submit periodic assessment reports to the FDA to demonstrate that the goals of the REMS are being met. REMS and other risk management programs are designed to ensure that a drug’s benefits outweigh the risks and vary in the elements they contain. If the FDA is not satisfied with the results of the periodic assessment reports we submit for any of our REMS, the FDA may also modify our REMS or take other regulatory actions, such as implementing revised or restrictive labeling. The drug delivery devices approved for use in combination with our products are also subject to regulatory oversight and review for safety and malfunctions. See Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. If regulatory agencies determine that we or other parties (including our clinical trial investigators, those operating our patient support programs or licensees of our products) have not complied with the applicable reporting, other pharmacovigilance or other safety or quality assessment requirements, we may become subject to additional inspections, warning letters or other enforcement actions, including fines, marketing authorization withdrawal and other penalties. Our product candidates and marketed products can also be affected by safety problems or signals occurring with respect to products that are similar to ours or that implicate an entire class of products. Further, as a result of clinical trials, including sub-analyses or meta-analyses of earlier clinical trials (a meta-analysis involves the use of various statistical methods to combine results from previous separate but related studies) performed by us or others, concerns may arise about the sufficiency of the data or studies underlying a product’s approved label. Such actual or perceived safety problems or concerns can lead to: • revised or restrictive labeling for our products, or the potential for restrictive labeling that has resulted, and may in the future result, in our decision not to commercialize a product candidate; • requirement of risk management or minimization activities or other regulatory agency compliance actions related to the promotion and sale of our products; • post-marketing commitments, mandated post-marketing requirements or pharmacovigilance programs for our approved products; • product recalls of our approved products; • required changes to the processes used in the manufacture of our products, which could increase our manufacturing costs and affect the availability of contract manufacturers we may utilize to assist in such manufacturing; • revocation of approval for our products from the market completely, or within particular therapeutic areas or patient types; • increased timelines or delays in being approved by the FDA or other regulatory bodies; and/or • treatments or product candidates not being approved by regulatory bodies. 47 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                For example, after an imbalance in positively adjudicated CV serious adverse events was observed in one of the phase 3 clinical trials for EVENITY® but not in another, larger phase 3 study, in April 2019 the FDA approved EVENITY® for the treatment of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women at high risk for fracture, along with a post-marketing requirement. The requirement includes a five-year observational feasibility study that could be followed by a comparative safety study or trial. In addition to our innovative products, we are working to develop and commercialize biosimilar versions of a number of products currently manufactured, marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies. In some markets, there is not yet a legislative or regulatory pathway for the approval of biosimilars. In the United States, the BPCIA provided for such a pathway; while the FDA continues to implement it, discussions continue as to the evidence needed to demonstrate biosimilarity or interchangeability for specific products. See We currently face competition from biosimilars and generics and expect to face increasing competition from biosimilars and generics in the future. Delays or uncertainties in the development or implementation of such pathways could result in delays or difficulties in getting our biosimilar products approved by regulatory authorities, subject us to unanticipated development costs or otherwise reduce the value of the investments we have made in the biosimilars area. Further, we cannot predict whether any repeal or reform of the ACA or other legislation or policy initiatives would affect the biosimilar pathway or have a material adverse effect on our development of biosimilars or on our marketed biosimilars. In addition, if we are unable to bring our biosimilar products to market on a timely basis and secure “first-to­market” or other advantageous positions, our future biosimilar sales, business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected. Some of our products are used with drug delivery or companion diagnostic devices that have their own regulatory, manufacturing and other risks. Many of our products and product candidates may be used in combination with a drug delivery device, such as an injector or other delivery system. For example, Neulasta® is available as part of the Neulasta® Onpro® kit, and our AutoTouch® reusable autoinjector is used with ENBREL Mini® single-dose prefilled cartridges. In addition, some of our products or product candidates, including many of our oncology product candidates, including sotorasib, may also require the use of a companion or other diagnostic device such as a device that determines whether the patient is eligible to use our drug or that helps ensure its safe and effective use. In some regions, including the United States, regulatory authorities may require contemporaneous approval of the companion diagnostic device and the therapeutic product; in others the regulatory authorities may require a separate study of the companion diagnostic device. Our product candidates or expanded indications of our products used with such devices may not be approved or may be substantially delayed in receiving regulatory approval if development or approval of such devices is delayed, such devices do not also gain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance, or if such devices do not remain commercially available. When approval of the product and device is sought under a single marketing drug application, the increased complexity of the review process may delay receipt of regulatory approval. In addition, some of these devices may be provided by single-source unaffiliated third-party companies. We are dependent on the sustained cooperation and effort of those third-party companies to supply and/or market the devices and, in some cases, to conduct the studies required for approval or clearance by the applicable regulatory agencies. We are also dependent on those third-party companies continuing to meet applicable regulatory or other requirements. Failure to successfully develop, modify, or supply the devices, delays in or failures of the Amgen or third-party studies, or failure of us or the third-party companies to obtain or maintain regulatory approval or clearance of the devices could result in increased development costs; delays in, or failure to obtain or maintain, regulatory approval; and/or associated delays in a product candidate reaching the market or in the addition of new indications for existing products. We are also required to collect and assess user complaints, adverse events and malfunctions regarding our devices, and actual or perceived safety problems or concerns with a device used with our product can lead to regulatory actions and adverse effects on our products. See Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Additionally, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and inspections to identify and evaluate potential issues with our devices. For example, in 2017, the FDA reported on its adverse event reporting system that it was evaluating our Neulasta® Onpro® kit. Subsequently, we implemented device and labeling enhancements to address product complaints received on this device. We continuously monitor complaints and adverse events and implement additional enhancements as needed. Loss of regulatory approval or clearance of a device that is used with our product may also result in the removal of our product from the market. Further, failure to successfully develop, supply, or gain or maintain approval for these devices could adversely affect sales of the related approved products. 48 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Some of our pharmaceutical pipeline and our commercial product sales rely on collaborations with third parties, which may adversely affect the development and sale of our products. We depend on alliances with other companies, including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies, vendors and service providers, for the development of a portion of the products in our pharmaceutical pipeline and for the commercialization and sales of certain of our commercial products. For example, we have collaborations with third parties under which we share development rights, obligations and costs and/or commercial rights and obligations. See Item 1. Business—Business Relationships. Failures by these parties to meet their contractual, regulatory, or other obligations to us or any disruption in the relationships between us and these third parties, could have a material adverse effect on our pharmaceutical pipeline and business. In addition, our collaborative relationships for R&D and/or commercialization and sales often extend for many years and have given, and may in the future give, rise to disputes regarding the relative rights, obligations and revenues of us and our collaboration partners, including the ownership or prosecution of intellectual property and associated rights and obligations. This could result in the loss of intellectual property rights or protection, delay the development and sale of potential pharmaceutical products, affect the effective sale and delivery of our commercialized products and lead to lengthy and expensive litigation, administrative proceedings or arbitration. For example, we are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig®. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. While our collaboration remains in place until the litigation is resolved and we remain committed to continuing to work with Novartis to sell and deliver Aimovig®, it is possible that the dispute may nevertheless affect the efficiency of operation and future growth of the collaboration. The litigation may also affect or delay, or lead to a termination of, other projects with Novartis. Our efforts to collaborate with or acquire other companies, products, or technology, and to integrate the operations of companies or to support the products or technology we have acquired, may not be successful, and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or failures to realize the benefits of the transactions. We seek innovation through significant investment in both internal R&D and external transactions, including collaborations, partnering, alliances, licenses, joint ventures, mergers and acquisitions (collectively, acquisition activity). Acquisition activities may be subject to regulatory approvals or other requirements that are not within our control. There can be no assurance that such regulatory or other approvals will be obtained or that all closing conditions required in connection with our acquisition activities will be satisfied or waived, which could result in us being unable to complete the planned acquisition activities. Acquisition activities are complex, time consuming and expensive and may result in unanticipated costs, delays or other operational or financial problems related to integrating the acquired company and business with our company, which may divert our management’s attention from other business issues and opportunities and restrict the full realization of the anticipated benefits of such transactions within the expected timeframe or at all. We may pay substantial amounts of cash, incur debt or issue equity securities to pay for acquisition activities, which could adversely affect our liquidity or result in dilution to our stockholders, respectively. Further, failures or difficulties in integrating or retaining new personnel or in integrating the operations of the businesses, products or assets we acquire (including related technology, commercial operations, compliance programs, manufacturing, distribution and general business operations and procedures) may affect our ability to realize the benefits of the transaction and grow our business and may result in us incurring asset impairment or restructuring charges. These and other challenges may arise in connection with our recent acquisition of Otezla® and/or collaboration with BeiGene, or with other acquisition activities, which could have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and stock price. RISKS RELATED TO OPERATIONS We perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California; significant disruptions or production failures at these facilities could significantly impair our ability to supply our products or continue our clinical trials. The global supply of our products and product candidates for commercial sales and for use in our clinical trials is significantly dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our manufacturing facilities, in particular those in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico and Thousand Oaks, California. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. 49 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      We currently perform a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing that supports our product candidates at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California. A substantial disruption in our ability to operate our Thousand Oaks manufacturing facility could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our product candidates for use in our clinical trials, leading to delays in development of our product candidates. In addition, we currently perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities at our facility in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. In recent years, Puerto Rico has been affected by natural disasters, including droughts in mid-2020, earthquakes in early 2020 and Hurricane Maria in 2017. These natural disasters have affected, and may continue to affect, public and private properties and Puerto Rico’s electric grid and communications networks in the future. While the critical manufacturing areas of our commercial manufacturing facility were not significantly affected by these natural disasters, the restoration of electrical service on the island after Hurricane Maria was a slow process, and our facility operated with electrical power from backup diesel powered generators for some time. We also operated on backup generators for a few weeks after the early 2020 earthquakes in Puerto Rico. Further instability of the electric grid could require us to increase the use of our generators or to continue using them exclusively. In addition, future storms, earthquakes or other natural disasters or events could cause a more significant effect on our manufacturing operations. Puerto Rico and the rest of the world are facing the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the associated health and economic implications. Since March2020, the Governor of Puerto Rico issued Executive Orders requiring the lockdown of businesses and government facilities, imposing restrictions on business operations and a curfew on residents. Our operations and employees have been exempted from the lockdown and curfew, but we cannot predict how long these orders will continue in effect and what impact these orders and the COVID-19 pandemic will have on our future operations, and whether the Governor will issue future Executive Orders imposing stricter lockdown and curfew measures should COVID-19 cases rise in Puerto Rico. Although our ability to manufacture and supply our products has not, to date, been significantly affected by these natural disasters or the COVID-19 pandemic, a combination of these challenges or other issues that could give rise to any substantial disruption to our ability to operate our Puerto Rico manufacturing facility or get supplies and manufactured products transported to and from that location could materially and adversely affect our ability to supply our products and affect our product sales. See Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Hurricane Maria, the earthquakes of early 2020 and the COVID-19 pandemic have placed greater stress on the island’s already challenged economy. Beginning in 2016, the government of Puerto Rico defaulted on its roughly $72 billion in debt. In response, the U.S. Congress passed the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), which established a Financial Oversight and Management Board (Oversight Board) to provide fiscal oversight. Title III of PROMESA provides Puerto Rico with a judicial process for restructuring its debt similar to, but not identical to, Chapter 9 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, including a stay of debtholder litigation. In 2017, the Oversight Board approved and certified the filing in the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico of a voluntary petition under Title III of PROMESA for the government of Puerto Rico and certain of its governmental entities, including the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority, which is currently undergoing a privatization process of its transmission and distribution infrastructure. Under PROMESA, other Title III filings for additional government entities may occur, further complicating Puerto Rico’s already uncertain fiscal stability. In June 2019, in response to legal challenges, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of PROMESA and confirmed the constitutionality of the appointment process. Each year since 2017, the Oversight Board has updated Puerto Rico’s fiscal plans imposing significant expense reductions. Each plan has stressed the need for fiscal and structural reforms to address Puerto Rico’s challenging economic and demographic trends. There is pending litigation between the Government of Puerto Rico and the Oversight Board with regards to the Oversight Board’s powers under PROMESA and authority to review and prevent the enforcement of government-approved legislation. This litigation, currently underway in the Title III Court, may impact how and when Puerto Rico will eventually restructure its debt and achieve fiscal and economic stability. While the government and the Oversight Board have authorized emergency relief packages due to the COVID-19 pandemic, it is uncertain how, or the degree to which, the pandemic will impact Puerto Rico’s fiscal and structural reforms and its economy. In addition, the 2017 Tax Act no longer permits deferral of U.S. taxation on Puerto Rico earnings, although these earnings generally will be taxed in the United States at a reduced rate. Given Puerto Rico’s challenged economy, disaster recovery needs and impact from the COVID-19 pandemic, it may be difficult for Puerto Rico to sustain or grow its manufacturing base, which contributes significantly to Puerto Rico’s economy, due to competition from other locations subject to similar levels of taxation. 50 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      While PROMESA and the actions above continue to be important factors in moving Puerto Rico toward economic stability, Puerto Rico’s ongoing economic and demographic trend challenges and political situation, the effects of natural disasters, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the effects of the 2017 Tax Act or other potential tax law changes have negatively affected, and may in the future negatively affect, the territorial government’s provision of utilities or other services in Puerto Rico that we use in the operation of our business and could create the potential for increased taxes or fees to operate in Puerto Rico, result in a migration of workers from Puerto Rico to the mainland United States, or make it more expensive or difficult for us to operate in Puerto Rico. These factors could have a material adverse effect on our ability to supply our products, on our business and on our product sales. We rely on third-party suppliers for certain of our raw materials, medical devices and components. We rely on unaffiliated third-party suppliers for certain raw materials, medical devices and components necessary for the manufacturing of our commercial and clinical products. Certain of those raw materials, medical devices and components are proprietary products of those unaffiliated third-party suppliers and are specifically cited in our drug applications with regulatory agencies so that they must be obtained from that specific sole source or sources and could not be obtained from another supplier unless and until the regulatory agency approved such supplier. For example, Scandinavian Health Limited Group is our single source of SureClick® autoinjectors for Repatha®, ENBREL, Aimovig®, AMGEVITATM and Aranesp®. Also, certain of the raw materials required in the commercial and clinical manufacturing of our products are sourced from other countries and/or derived from biological sources, including mammalian tissues, bovine serum and human serum albumin. Among the reasons we may be unable to obtain these raw materials, medical devices and components include: • regulatory requirements or action by regulatory agencies or others; • adverse financial or other strategic developments at or affecting the supplier, including bankruptcy; • unexpected demand for or shortage of raw materials, medical devices or components; • failure to comply with our quality standards which results in quality and product failures, product contamination and/or recall; • a material shortage, contamination, recall and/or restrictions on the use of certain biologically derived substances or other raw materials; • discovery of previously unknown or undetected imperfections in raw materials, medical devices or components; • cyberattacks on supplier systems; and • labor disputes or shortages, including from the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) and natural disasters. For example, in prior years we have experienced shortages in certain components necessary for the formulation, fill and finish of certain of our products in our Puerto Rico facility. Further quality issues that result in unexpected additional demand for certain components may lead to shortages of required raw materials or components (such as we have experienced with EPOGEN® glass vials). We may experience similar or other shortages in the future resulting in delayed shipments, supply constraints, clinical trial delays, contract disputes and/or stock-outs of our products. These or other similar events could negatively affect our ability to satisfy demand for our products or conduct clinical trials, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Manufacturing difficulties, disruptions or delays could limit supply of our products and limit our product sales. Manufacturing biologic and small molecule human therapeutic products is difficult, complex and highly regulated. We manufacture many of our commercial products and product candidates internally. In addition, we currently use third-party contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our products, and we currently use contract manufacturers to produce, or assist in the production of, a number of our late-stage product candidates and drug delivery devices. See Item 1. Business—Manufacturing, Distribution and Raw Materials—Manufacturing. Our ability to adequately and timely manufacture and supply our products (and product candidates to support our clinical trials) is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operation of our facilities and those of our third-party contract manufacturers, which may be affected by: • capacity of manufacturing facilities; • contamination by microorganisms or viruses, or foreign particles from the manufacturing process; 51 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    • natural or other disasters, including hurricanes, earthquakes, volcanoes or fires; • labor disputes or shortages, including the effects of health emergencies (such as novel viruses or pandemics such as the one we are currently experiencing with COVID-19) or natural disasters; • compliance with regulatory requirements; • changes in forecasts of future demand; • timing and actual number of production runs and production success rates and yields; • updates of manufacturing specifications; • contractual disputes with our suppliers and contract manufacturers; • timing and outcome of product quality testing; • power failures and/or other utility failures; • cyberattacks on supplier systems; • breakdown, failure, substandard performance or improper installation or operation of equipment (including our information technology systems and network-connected control systems or those of our contract manufacturers or third-party service providers); and/or • delays in the ability of the FDA or foreign regulatory agencies to provide us necessary reviews, inspections and approvals, including as a result of a subsequent extended U.S. federal or other government shutdowns. If any of these or other problems affect production in one or more of our facilities or those of our third-party contract manufacturers, or if we do not accurately forecast demand for our products or the amount of our product candidates required in clinical trials, we may be unable to start or increase production in our unaffected facilities to meet demand. If the efficient manufacture and supply of our products or product candidates is interrupted, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends, contract disputes and/or recalls of our products. From time to time we have initiated recalls of certain lots of our products. For example, in July 2014 we initiated a voluntary recall of an Aranesp® lot distributed in the EU after particles were detected in a quality control sample following distribution of that lot, and in April 2018 we initiated a precautionary recall of two batches of Vectibix® distributed in Switzerland after potential crimping defects were discovered in the metal seals on some product vials. If we are at any time unable to provide an uninterrupted supply of our products to patients, we may lose patients and physicians may elect to prescribe competing therapeutics instead of our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Our manufacturing processes, those of our third-party contract manufacturers and those of certain of our third-party service providers must undergo regulatory approval processes and are subject to continued review by the FDA and other regulatory authorities. It can take longer than five years to build, validate and license another manufacturing plant, and it can take longer than three years to qualify and license a new contract manufacturer or service provider. If we elect or are required to make changes to our manufacturing processes because of new regulatory requirements, new interpretations of existing requirements or other reasons, this could increase our manufacturing costs and result in delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, stock-outs, adverse event trends or contract negotiations or disputes. Such manufacturing challenges may also occur if our existing contract manufacturers are unable or unwilling to timely implement such changes, or at all. 52 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            In addition, regulatory agencies conduct routine monitoring and conduct inspections of our manufacturing facilities and processes as well as those of our third-party contract manufacturers and service providers. If regulatory authorities determine that we or our third-party contract manufacturers or certain of our third-party service providers have violated regulations, they may mandate corrective actions and/or issue warning letters, or even restrict, suspend or revoke our prior approvals, prohibiting us from manufacturing our products or conducting clinical trials or selling our marketed products until we or the affected third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers comply, or indefinitely. See also Our current products and products in development cannot be sold without regulatory approval. Such issues may also delay the approval of product candidates we have submitted for regulatory review, even if such product candidates are not directly related to the products, devices or processes at issue with regulators. Because our third-party contract manufacturers and certain of our third-party service providers are subject to the FDA and foreign regulatory authorities, alternative qualified third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers may not be available on a timely basis, or at all. If we or our third-party contract manufacturers or third-party service providers cease or interrupt production or if our third-party contract manufacturers and third-party service providers fail to supply materials, products or services to us, we may experience delayed shipments, delays in our clinical trials, supply constraints, contract disputes, stock-outs and/or recalls of our products. Additionally, we distribute a substantial volume of our commercial products through our primary distribution centers in Louisville, Kentucky for the United States and in Breda, Netherlands for Europe and much of the rest of the world. We also conduct most of the labeling and packaging of our products distributed in Europe and much of the rest of the world in Breda. Our ability to timely supply products is dependent on the uninterrupted and efficient operations of our distribution and logistics centers, our third-party logistics providers and our labeling and packaging facility in Breda. Further, we rely on commercial transportation, including air and sea freight, for the distribution of our products to our customers, which may be negatively affected by natural disasters, security threats and/or the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. There have also been legislative and administrative proposals seeking to incentivize greater drug manufacturing in the United States with the stated goal of improving supply reliability in the United States. For example, on August 6, 2020, the previous Administration issued an Executive Order aimed at boosting domestic production of essential medicines, medical countermeasures, and critical inputs titled “Executive Order on Ensuring Essential Medicines, Medical Countermeasures, and Critical Inputs are Made in the United States.” Additionally, one legislative proposal would prohibit the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs from purchasing certain drugs that have active pharmaceutical ingredients manufactured outside the United States. While we perform a substantial majority of our commercial manufacturing activities in the United States, including in the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, and a substantial majority of our clinical manufacturing activities at our facility in Thousand Oaks, California, the passage of such legislation could result in foreign governments enacting retaliatory legislation or regulatory actions, which may have an adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. GENERAL RISK FACTORS Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Our operations and performance have been, and may continue to be, affected by global economic conditions. The economic downturn resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic has precipitated a global recession which may be of an extended duration. Additionally, financial pressures may cause government or other third-party payers to more aggressively seek cost containment measures. See Our sales depend on coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, and pricing and reimbursement pressures may affect our profitability. As a result of global economic conditions, some third-party payers may delay or be unable to satisfy their reimbursement obligations. Job losses or other economic hardships may also affect patients’ ability to afford health care as a result of increased co-pay or deductible obligations, greater cost sensitivity to existing co-pay or deductible obligations, lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons. We believe such conditions have led and could continue to lead to reduced demand for our products, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. Economic conditions may also adversely affect the ability of our distributors, customers and suppliers to obtain the liquidity required to buy inventory or raw materials and to perform their obligations under agreements with us, which could disrupt our operations. Although we monitor our distributors’, customers’ and suppliers’ financial condition and their liquidity to mitigate our business risks, some of our distributors, customers and suppliers may become insolvent, which could have a material adverse effect on our product sales, business and results of operations. A significant worsening of global economic conditions could materially increase these risks facing us. We maintain a significant portfolio of investments disclosed as cash equivalents and marketable securities on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The global spread of COVID-19 has also led to disruption and volatility in the global capital markets. We have certain assets, including equity investments, that are exposed to market fluctuations that could, in a sustained or recurrent series of market disruptions, result in impairments. The value of our investments may also be adversely affected by interest rate fluctuations, downgrades in credit ratings, illiquidity in the capital markets and other factors that may result in other-than-temporary declines in the value of our investments. Any of those events could cause us to record impairment charges with respect to our investment portfolio or to realize losses on sales of investments. 53 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Our stock price is volatile. Our stock price, like that of our peers in the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industries, is volatile. Our revenues and operating results may fluctuate from period to period for a number of reasons. Events such as a delay in product development, changes to our expectations or strategy or even a relatively small revenue shortfall may cause financial results for a period to be below our expectations or projections. As a result, our revenues and operating results and, in turn, our stock price may be subject to significant fluctuations. Announcements or discussions, including via social media channels, of possible restrictive actions by government or private payers that would negatively affect our business or industry if ultimately enacted or adopted may also cause our stock price to fluctuate, whether or not such restrictive actions ever actually occur. Similarly, actual or perceived safety issues with our products or similar products or unexpected clinical trial results can have an immediate and rapid effect on our stock price, whether or not our operating results are materially affected. We may not be able to access the capital and credit markets on terms that are favorable to us, or at all. The capital and credit markets may experience extreme volatility and disruption, which may lead to uncertainty and liquidity issues for both borrowers and investors. For example, early in 2020, there were significant disruptions in the commercial paper market and several borrowers were unable to obtain funding at normal rates or maturities, which resulted in a significant increase in draws of corporate credit lines with banks. Similarly, the bond markets experienced extreme volatility in terms of interest rates and credit spreads, with several days without new issuances of corporate bonds. We expect to access the capital markets, from time to time, to supplement our existing funds and cash generated from operations in satisfying our needs for working capital; capital expenditure and debt service requirements; our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock; and other business initiatives we strategically plan to pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. In the event of adverse capital and credit market conditions, we may be unable to obtain capital market financing on similar favorable terms, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations. Changes in credit ratings issued by nationally recognized credit-rating agencies could adversely affect our ability to obtain capital market financing and the cost of such financing and have an adverse effect on the market price of our securities.

MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS The following management’s discussion and analysis (MD&A) is intended to assist the reader in understanding Amgen’s business. MD&A is provided as a supplement to, and should be read in conjunction with, our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Our results of operations discussed in MD&A are presented in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). Amgen operates in one business segment: human therapeutics. Therefore, our results of operations are discussed on a consolidated basis. Forward-looking statements This report and other documents we file with the SEC contain forward-looking statements that are based on current expectations, estimates, forecasts and projections about us, our future performance, our business, our beliefs and our management’s assumptions. In addition, we, or others on our behalf, may make forward-looking statements in press releases, written statements or our communications and discussions with investors and analysts in the normal course of business through meetings, webcasts, phone calls and conference calls. Such words as “expect,” “anticipate,” “outlook,” “could,” “target,” “project,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” “seek,” “estimate,” “should,” “may,” “assume” and “continue” as well as variations of such words and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and they involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. We describe our respective risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could affect the outcome or results of operations in Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors. We have based our forward-looking statements on our management’s beliefs and assumptions based on information available to our management at the time the statements are made. We caution you that actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed, implied or forecasted by our forward-looking statements. Reference is made in particular to forward-looking statements regarding product sales, regulatory activities, clinical trial results, reimbursement, expenses, earnings per share (EPS), liquidity and capital resources, trends, planned dividends, stock repurchases, collaborations and effects of pandemics. Except as required under the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the SEC, we do not have any intention or obligation to update publicly any forward-looking statements after the distribution of this report, whether as a result of new information, future events, changes in assumptions or otherwise. 59 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               Overview Amgen is a biotechnology company committed to unlocking the potential of biology for patients suffering from serious illnesses. A biotechnology pioneer since 1980, Amgen has grown to be one of the world’s leading independent biotechnology companies, has reached millions of patients around the world and is developing a pipeline of medicines with breakaway potential. In 2020, we celebrated our 40th anniversary, continuing our history of focusing on innovative medicines that have the potential to be first-in-class molecules and that have a large-effect size on serious diseases. Our principal products—those with the most significant annual commercial sales—are ENBREL, Prolia®, Neulasta®, Otezla®, XGEVA®, Aranesp®, KYPROLIS® and Repatha®. We also market a number of other products, including Nplate®, Vectibix®, MVASI®, Parsabiv®, EPOGEN®, KANJINTI®, BLINCYTO®, Aimovig®, EVENITY®, AMGEVITATM, Sensipar®/ Mimpara®, NEUPOGEN®, IMLYGIC®, Corlanor® and AVSOLA®. For additional information about our products, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products. Our strategy includes integrated activities intended to maintain and strengthen our competitive position in the industry. We focus on six commercial areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology, bone health, CV disease, nephrology and neuroscience, and we conduct discovery research primarily in three therapeutic areas: inflammation, oncology/hematology and CV/metabolic diseases. In 2020, we advanced our innovative pipeline, successfully integrated Otezla®, acquired in November 2019, into our inflammation portfolio, advanced our international expansion and continued to provide uninterrupted supply of our medicines globally through the COVID-19 pandemic. We accomplished these objectives while maintaining a strategic and disciplined approach to capital allocation, and advancing our environmental, social and governance efforts. During the year, while meeting the challenges of a global pandemic and facing increased competition from biosimilars and generics, total product sales increased 9%, driven by volume growth primarily from Otezla®, partially offset by lower net selling prices. Product sales increased 9% and 10% in the United States and rest of the world, respectively. Total operating expenses increased 19%, driven by expenses related to Otezla®. We continued to advance our pipeline, including sotorasib and tezepelumab—two molecules with respect to which we have achieved positive registration enabling data from our clinical trial activities. We also continued to advance our biosimilar program with the launch of AVSOLA® and the approval of RIABNITM in the United States. Our biosimilars are expected to launch in new markets throughout 2021. Lastly, we broadened our international reach, particularly in the Asia Pacific region with our investment in and strategic collaboration with BeiGene to expand our oncology presence in China, as well as the establishment of our wholly owned affiliate in Japan. Cash flows from operating activities totaled $10.5 billion, enabling us to invest in our business while returning capital to shareholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases. For 2020, we increased our quarterly cash dividend by 10% to $1.60 per share of common stock. In December 2020, we declared a cash dividend of $1.76 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2021. We also repurchased 15.2 million shares of our common stock throughout 2020, at an aggregate cost of $3.5 billion. During the year, we had proceeds from the issuance of debt of $8.9 billion and repayments of debt of $6.5 billion. In addition, we exchanged some of our higher interest rate debt for newly issued debt with a lower interest rate and a later maturity date. Amgen’s approach to, and investment in, human capital resource management is directed at attracting, motivating and retaining talent to tackle the challenges of running an enterprise focused on the discovery, development, and commercialization of innovative medicines. Our compensation, benefits and development programs are designed to encourage performance, promote accountability and adherence to Company values, and in alignment with the interests of the Company’s shareholders. Further, we believe that a diverse and inclusive culture fosters innovation, which supports our ability to serve patients. We also believe our global presence is strengthened by having a workforce that reflects the diversity of the patients we serve. It is with these beliefs in mind that we have continued to strengthen and grow our culture of diversity, inclusion and belonging. Our internal efforts include, in 2019, establishing a Diversity, Inclusion and Belonging Council. We are engaging in activities and setting goals to improve our focus on diversity, inclusion and belonging. For further information on these and other efforts, see Part I, Item 1.

In 2020, we met or exceeded our environmental sustainability targets set out in 2013 that called for reducing fleet carbon output by up to 20%, facility carbon output by 10%, water consumption by 10% and waste disposal by 35%2. We achieved our 2020 targets while growing revenues, increasing production capacity, and expanding to more than 100 countries over the same 2013 to 2020 period. To continue on our path to greater environmental sustainability, in January 2021 we announced a new set of long-term environmental targets to achieve by 2027, including achieving carbon neutrality, reducing water consumption by 40% and reducing waste disposed by 75%. Our long-term success depends to a great extent on our ability to continue to discover, develop and commercialize innovative products and acquire or collaborate on therapies currently in development by other companies. We must develop new products to achieve revenue growth and to offset revenue losses when products lose their exclusivity or when competing products are launched. Certain of our products face increasing pressure from competition, including biosimilars and generics. For additional information, including information on the expirations of patents for various products, see Part I, Item 1. Business —Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Patents, and Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. We devote considerable resources to R&D activities, but successful product development in the biotechnology industry is highly uncertain. We also face increasing regulatory scrutiny of safety and efficacy both before and after products launch. Rising healthcare costs and uncertain economic conditions continue to pose challenges to our business, including increasing pressure by third-party payers, such as governments and private payers, to reduce healthcare expenditures. As a result of public and private healthcare-provider focus, the industry continues to experience significant pricing pressures and other cost containment measures. Finally, wholesale and end-user buying patterns can affect our product sales. These effects can cause fluctuations in quarterly product sales and have generally not been significant when comparing full-year product performance to the prior year. See Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products and Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors for further discussion of certain factors that could impact our future product sales. COVID-19 pandemic The COVID-19 pandemic has had a moderate impact to our business in 2020. Since the onset of the pandemic in early 2020, we have been carefully monitoring its impact on our global operations. We have taken appropriate steps to minimize the risk to our employees. A significant number of our employees have been working remotely, with the exception of certain staff that require access to our manufacturing and laboratory research facilities, in accordance with applicable government health and safety protocols and guidance issued in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. To date, our remote working arrangements have not significantly affected our ability to maintain critical business operations, and we have not experienced disruptions or shortages of our supply of medicines. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, we have seen changes in demand trends for some of our products, including lower demand for certain products as continuing patient access to those products has been affected by COVID-19, particularly in the early phases of the pandemic. For example, near the end of March, we began to observe a decline in sales of Prolia®, as elderly patients, who are relatively more vulnerable to COVID-19, avoided doctors’ offices. Demand has since recovered to varying degrees by product as local conditions improved in certain geographies that opened after an initial improvement in COVID-19 infection rates, allowing patients to resume receiving their treatments. During the second half of the year, our own efforts remain focused on assisting patients with improving their continuity of care to increase product access as compared to what they experienced during the earlier stages of the pandemic. Recently, higher rates of infection have been observed in certain geographies, including the United States and Europe, which may further restrict demand, similar to early phases of the pandemic. As a result, we expect to see continued volatility through at least the duration of the pandemic as governments respond to current local conditions. 2 Represents reductions against established baselines, taking into account only verified reduction projects, and does not take into account changes associated with contraction or expansion of the company. 61 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The majority of clinical trials that were paused at the onset of the pandemic to ensure subject safety or data integrity have resumed. Study enrollment was affected negatively the most in the second quarter of the year and by the end of 2020 resumed to around pre-pandemic levels. However, going forward COVID-19 infection rates and related vaccination activities may impact future study enrollment. We continuously monitor our ability for study enrollment on an institution by institution basis and reevaluate the status of studies, pausing when uncertainty arises with regard to the trial sites’ ability to ensure safety or data integrity. We remain focused on supporting our active clinical sites in providing care for these patients and in providing investigational drug supply. In addition, our R&D organization is supporting efforts to combat the COVID-19 pandemic in a number of ways, including by (i) working to support production of therapeutic antibodies that could diminish the impact of COVID-19 on patients, (ii) joining a public–private partnership between leading companies in our industry and U.S. government health agencies to develop a strategy for a coordinated research response and (iii) participating in platform studies to investigate treatments in adult patients hospitalized with severe COVID-19 infections. We continue to believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditures and debt service requirements as well as to engage in the capital-return and other business initiatives that we plan to strategically pursue.

In addition, any reference to increases or decreases in inventory refers to changes in inventory held by wholesaler customers and end users (such as pharmacies). Total product sales increased for 2020, primarily driven by unit demand increases from newer brands including Otezla®, acquired in November 2019, MVASI®, KANJINTI® and Repatha®. These unit demand increases were partially offset by declines in net selling prices for certain products, unit demand declines for mature brands that face biosimilar or generic competition and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic. For 2021, we expect that net selling prices will continue to decline. We also expect increasing competition against our biosimilar products. Further, the first quarter historically represents the lowest product sales quarter for the year, in part, due to plan changes, insurance reverifications and higher co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles, particularly for our pharmacy benefit products. During the initial stages of the COVID-19 pandemic, we experienced changes in demand trends for some of our products. The pandemic interrupted many physician–patient interactions, which led to delays in diagnosis and treatment, with varying degrees of impact across our portfolio. In general, sales of negatively affected products fell the most in the early part of the second quarter, with product demand beginning to show some recovery in the second half of the year but still below pre­pandemic levels. Nevertheless, given the increased intensity exiting 2020 and the unpredictable nature of the pandemic, we expect there could be intermittent disruptions in physician–patient interactions going forward, and thus we continue to expect quarter-to-quarter variability. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors of this Form 10-K. In addition, other changes in the healthcare ecosystem introduce variability into product sales trends. For example, changes in U.S. employment could lead to changes to the insured population, with growth in Medicaid enrollees and uninsured individuals having a negative impact on revenues. Overall, uncertainty has increased around the timing and magnitude of our sales during the COVID-19 pandemic. Other revenues increased for 2020, primarily driven by higher royalties. Operating expenses increased for 2020, primarily driven by acquisition- and commercial-related expenses for Otezla®. Although changes in foreign currency exchange rates result in increases or decreases in our reported international product sales, the benefit or detriment that such movements have on our international product sales is partially offset by corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses and our related foreign currency hedging activities. Our hedging activities seek to offset the impacts, both positive and negative, that foreign currency exchange rate changes may have on our net income by hedging our net foreign currency exposure, primarily with respect to product sales denominated in euros. The net impact from changes in foreign currency exchange rates was not material in 2020, 2019 or 2018. 63 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Results of Operations Product sales Worldwide product sales were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 ENBREL Prolia® Neulasta® Otezla® XGEVA® Aranesp® KYPROLIS® Repatha® Other products Total product sales Total U.S. Total ROW $ $ $ 4,996 2,763 2,293 2,195 1,899 1,568 1,065 887 6,574 24,240 17,985 6,255 (4)% 3 % (29)% * (2)% (9)% 2 % 34 % 19 % 9 % 9 % 10 % $ $ $ 5,226 2,672 3,221 178 1,935 1,729 1,044 661 5,538 22,204 16,531 5,673 4 % 17 % (28)% N/A 8 % (8)% 8 % 20 % (1)% (1)% (5)% 11 % $ $ $ 5,014 2,291 4,475 — 1,786 1,877 968 550 5,572 22,533 17,429 5,104 Total product sales $ 24,240 9 % $ 22,204 (1)% $ 22,533 * Change in excess of 100%.

In addition, for a list of our products’ significant competitors, see Part I, Item 1. Business—Marketing, Distribution and Selected Marketed Products—Competition. ENBREL Total ENBREL sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, 2020 Change December 31, 2019 Change December 31, 2018 ENBREL — U.S. $ 4,855 (4)% $ 5,050 5 % $ 4,807 ENBREL — Canada 141 (20)% 176 (15)% 207 Total ENBREL $ 4,996 (4)% $ 5,226 4 % $ 5,014 The decrease in ENBREL sales for 2020 was driven by lower unit demand and net selling price, partially offset by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and inventory. Consistent with prior periods, ENBREL has continued to lose market share, and this decline has been compounded by a reduction in the growth rate of the rheumatology market as a result of COVID-19. For 2021, we expect ENBREL to follow the historic pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increase co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. In addition, for 2021, we expect volume and net selling price declines to continue. The increase in ENBREL sales for 2019 was primarily driven by favorable changes to estimated sales deductions and an increase in net selling price, partially offset by lower unit demand. In April 2019, the FDA approved a second biosimilar version of ENBREL, and we are involved in patent litigations with the two companies seeking to market their FDA-approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Companies with approved biosimilar versions of ENBREL may seek to enter the U.S. market if we are not successful in our litigations, or even earlier. Other companies are also developing proposed biosimilar versions of ENBREL. 64 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Prolia® Total Prolia® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Prolia® — U.S. $ 1,830 3 % $ 1,772 18 % $ 1,500 Prolia® — ROW 933 4 % 900 14 % 791 Total Prolia® $ 2,763 3 % $ 2,672 17 % $ 2,291 Disruptions in patient visits as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic affected demand during 2020 by altering the timing of patients receiving their semiannual doses and by lowering the diagnosis of osteoporosis in new patients. This deceleration of demand has softened the historical growth rates and altered demand patterns of Prolia® experienced in years prior to the pandemic. For 2021, historical demand patterns may continue to be impacted by the pandemic. The increase in global Prolia® sales for 2020 was driven by higher unit demand and net selling price. The increase in global Prolia® sales for 2019 was driven by higher unit demand. Neulasta® Total Neulasta® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Neulasta® — U.S. $ 2,001 (29)% $ 2,814 (27)% $ 3,866 Neulasta® — ROW 292 (28)% 407 (33)% 609 Total Neulasta® $ 2,293 (29)% $ 3,221 (28)% $ 4,475 The decreases in global Neulasta® sales for 2020 and 2019 were driven by the impact of biosimilar competition on net selling price and unit demand. Neulasta® sales included a $98 million order from the U.S. government in the first quarter of 2019. We have increased competition in the United States and Europe as a result of biosimilar versions of Neulasta®, which has had and will continue to have a material adverse impact on sales. We also expect other biosimilar versions to be approved in the future. For a discussion of ongoing patent litigations related to these and other biosimilars, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Otezla® Total Otezla® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Otezla® — U.S. $ 1,790 * $ 139 N/A $ — Otezla® — ROW 405 * 39 N/A — Total Otezla® $ 2,195 * $ 178 N/A $ — * Change in excess of 100%. Otezla® was acquired on November 21, 2019, and generated $2.2 billion and $178 million in global sales for the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. For 2021, we expect Otezla® to follow the historic pattern of lower sales in the first quarter relative to subsequent quarters due to the impact of benefit plan changes, insurance reverification and increase co-pay expenses as U.S. patients work through deductibles. For a discussion of ongoing litigation related to Otezla®, see Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 65 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              XGEVA® Total XGEVA® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 XGEVA® — U.S. $ 1,405 (4)% $ 1,457 9 % $ 1,338 XGEVA® — ROW 494 3 % 478 7 % 448 Total XGEVA® $ 1,899 (2)% $ 1,935 8 % $ 1,786 The decrease in global XGEVA® sales for 2020 was driven by lower unit demand as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Aranesp® Total Aranesp® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, 2020 Change December 31, 2019 Change December 31, 2018 Aranesp® — U.S. $ 629 (17)% $ 758 (20)% $ 942 Aranesp® — ROW 939 (3)% 971 4 % 935 Total Aranesp® $ 1,568 (9)% $ 1,729 (8)% $ 1,877 The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for 2020 was driven by declines in net selling price and unit demand. The decrease in global Aranesp® sales for 2019 was primarily driven by the impact of competition on unit demand in the United States. Aranesp® faces competition from a long-acting ESA. Aranesp® also faces competition from a biosimilar version of EPOGEN®. For 2021, we expect that sales will continue to decline due to short- and long-acting competition. KYPROLIS® Total KYPROLIS® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 KYPROLIS® — U.S. $ 710 9 % $ 654 12 % $ 583 KYPROLIS® — ROW 355 (9)% 390 1 % 385 Total KYPROLIS® $ 1,065 2 % $ 1,044 8 % $ 968 The increase in global KYPROLIS® sales for 2020 was primarily driven by an increase in net selling price and favorable changes in inventory, partially offset by lower unit demand. The increase in global KYPROLIS® sales for 2019 was primarily driven by higher unit demand. We are engaged in litigation with two companies that are challenging certain of our patents related to KYPROLIS® and that are seeking to market generic carfilzomib products. Separately, we have entered into confidential settlement agreements with other companies developing generic carfilzomib products, and the court has entered consent judgments enjoining those companies from infringing certain of our patents, subject to terms of the confidential settlement agreements. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The FDA reported that it has granted tentative or final approval to Abbreviated New Drug Applications (ANDAs) for generic carfilzomib products filed by a number of companies for generic carfilzomib products. The date of approval of those ANDAs for generic carfilzomib products is governed by the Hatch-Waxman Act and any applicable settlement agreements between the parties. 66 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Repatha® Total Repatha® sales by geographic region were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Year ended Year ended Year ended December 31, December 31, December 31, 2020 Change 2019 Change 2018 Repatha® — U.S. $ 459 22 % $ 376 5 % $ 358 Repatha® — ROW 428 50 % 285 48 % 192 Total Repatha® $ 887 34 % $ 661 20 % $ 550 The increases in global Repatha® sales for 2020 and 2019 were driven by higher unit demand, partially offset by lower net selling price.

Research and development The Company groups all of its R&D activities and related expenditures into three categories: (i) research and early pipeline, (ii) later-stage clinical programs and (iii) marketed products. These categories are described below: Category Description Research and early pipeline Later-stage clinical programs Marketed products R&D expenses incurred in activities substantially in support of early research through the completion of phase 1 clinical trials, including drug discovery,toxicology, pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism, and process development R&D expenses incurred in or related to phase 2 and phase 3 clinical programs intended to result in registration of a new product or a new indication for an existing product primarily in the United States or the EU R&D expenses incurred in support of the Company’s marketed products that are authorized to be sold primarily in the United States or the EU. Includes clinical trials designed to gather information on product safety (certain of which may be required by regulatory authorities) and their product characteristics after regulatory approval has been obtained, as well as the costs of obtaining regulatory approval of a product in a new market after approval in either the United States or the EU has been obtained R&D expense by category was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, Research and early pipeline Later-stage clinical programs Marketed products Total R&D expense $ $ 2020 1,405 1,365 1,437 4,207 2019 $ 1,649 1,062 1,405 $ 4,116 $ $ 2018 1,201 1,034 1,502 3,737 68 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            The increase in R&D expense for 2020 was driven by higher spend for later-stage clinical programs, including sotorasib, biosimilar programs and Otezla®, and higher spend for Otezla® included in marketed-product support. These increases were partially offset by recoveries from our collaboration with BeiGene that reduced expenses in later-stage clinical programs and in research and early pipeline, and lower spend in certain oncology programs included in research and early pipeline. The increase in R&D expense for 2019 was primarily driven by higher spend in research and early pipeline in support of our oncology programs, partially offset by lower marketed-product support. Selling, general and administrative The increase in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense for 2020 was driven by investments in certain marketed products, primarily Otezla®, and preparation for product launches, partially offset by a reduction in conference-related expenses due to the impact of COVID-19. The decrease in SG&A expense for 2019 was primarily driven by lower general and administrative expenses, the end of certain amortization charges in 2018 and lower spend for launched and marketed products, partially offset by spending for Otezla® commercial-related expenses. Other Other operating expenses for 2020 primarily consisted of legal settlement expenses. Other operating expenses for 2019 included $47 million in restructuring costs. Other operating expenses for 2018 included a $330 million impairment charge associated with an IPR&D asset and a $42 million favorable net change in the fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. See Part IV—Note 17, Fair value measurement, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxes Nonoperating expenses/income and income taxes were as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Interest expense, net $ 1,262 $ 1,289 $ 1,392 Interest and other income, net $ 256 $ 753 $ 674 Provision for income taxes $ 869 $ 1,296 $ 1,151 Effective tax rate 10.7 % 14.2 % 12.1 % Interest expense, net The decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2020 was primarily due to lower LIBOR rates on debt for which we effectively pay a variable rate of interest, partially offset by net costs associated with the early retirement of debt. The decrease in Interest expense, net, for 2019 was primarily due to a reduction in outstanding long-term debt as a result of maturities in 2019. Interest and other income, net The decrease in Interest and other income, net, for 2020 was primarily due to reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a decline in interest yields and losses incurred in connection with our BeiGene investment, partially offset by gains recognized on our investments in publicly traded equity securities and limited partnerships. We may continue to recognize losses in connection with our BeiGene investment in 2021. See Part IV—Note 9, Investments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. The increase in Interest and other income, net, for 2019 was primarily due to net gains on sales of investments in interest-bearing securities liquidated to fund our acquisition of Otezla® and our investment in BeiGene compared with losses in the prior year, partially offset by reduced interest income as a result of lower average cash balances and a gain recognized in connection with our acquisition of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), in the first quarter of 2018. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. 69 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Income taxes The decrease in our effective tax rate for 2020 compared with 2019 was primarily driven by favorable items, including audit settlements, adjustments to prior year tax liabilities, lower interest expense on uncertain tax positions and amortization related to the Otezla® acquisition, partially offset by changes in valuation allowance. The increase in our effective tax rate for 2019 compared with 2018 was primarily driven by a prior-year tax benefit associated with intercompany sales under U.S. corporate tax reform. In March and December 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the CARES Act and the Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2021, were passed into law and provide additional economic stimulus to address the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. We do not expect any significant benefit to our income tax provision as a result of this legislation. In 2017, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. However, we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process. In addition, in 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagree with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. The IRS audit for years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term. We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Financial Condition, Liquidity and Capital Resources Selected financial data was as follows (in millions): December 31, 2020 2019 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities $ 10,647 $ 8,911 Total assets $ 62,948 $ 59,707 Current portion of long-term debt $ 91 $ 2,953 Long-term debt $ 32,895 $ 26,950 Stockholders’ equity $ 9,409 $ 9,673 Cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities We have global access to our $10.6 billion balance of cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with primarily investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. Capital allocation Consistent with the objective to optimize our capital structure, we deploy our accumulated cash balances in a strategic manner and consider a number of alternatives, including strategic transactions (including those that expand our portfolio of products in areas of therapeutic interest), repayment of debt, payment of dividends and stock repurchases. 70 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  We intend to continue to invest in our business while returning capital to stockholders through the payment of cash dividends and stock repurchases, thereby reflecting our confidence in the future cash flows of our business. The timing and amount of future dividends and stock repurchases will vary based on a number of factors, including future capital requirements for strategic transactions, availability of financing on acceptable terms, debt service requirements, our credit rating, changes to applicable tax laws or corporate laws, changes to our business model and periodic determinations by our Board of Directors that cash dividends and/or stock repurchases are in the best interests of stockholders and are in compliance with applicable laws and the Company’s agreements. In addition, the timing and amount of stock repurchases may also be affected by our overall level of cash, stock price and blackout periods, during which we are restricted from repurchasing stock. The manner of stock repurchases may include private block purchases, tender offers and market transactions. The Board of Directors declared quarterly cash dividends of $1.60, $1.45 and $1.32 per share of common stock paid in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively, an increase of 10% over the prior year in both 2020 and 2019. In December 2020, the Board of Directors declared a cash dividend of $1.76 per share of common stock for the first quarter of 2021, an increase of 10% for this period, to be paid in March 2021. We also returned capital to stockholders through our stock repurchase program. During 2020, we repurchased $3.5 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $3.5 billion. In 2019, we repurchased $7.6 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $7.7 billion. In 2018, we repurchased $17.9 billion of common stock and had cash settlements of $17.8 billion, which included 52.1 million shares of common stock repurchased through a $10.0 billion tender offer. In May 2019 and December 2019, our Board of Directors increased the amount authorized under our stock repurchase program by an additional $5.0 billion and $4.0 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $3.0 billion remained available under the stock repurchase program. As a result of stock repurchases and quarterly dividend payments, we have an accumulated deficit as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Our accumulated deficit is not anticipated to affect our future ability to operate, repurchase stock, pay dividends or repay our debt given our expected continued profitability and strong financial position. We believe that existing funds, cash generated from operations and existing sources of and access to financing are adequate to satisfy our needs for working capital, capital expenditure and debt service requirements, our plans to pay dividends and repurchase stock and other business initiatives we plan to strategically pursue, including acquisitions and licensing activities. We anticipate that our liquidity needs can be met through a variety of sources, including cash provided by operating activities, sales of marketable securities, borrowings through commercial paper and/or syndicated credit facilities and access to other domestic and foreign debt markets and equity markets. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Global economic conditions may negatively affect us and may magnify certain risks that affect our business. Financing arrangements The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2020, were $0.1 billion and $32.9 billion, respectively. The current and noncurrent portions of our long-term borrowings as of December 31, 2019, were $3.0 billion and $27.0 billion, respectively. The carrying values of our long-term borrowings are net of fair value adjustments for interest rate swaps and unamortized discounts, premiums and offering costs. As of December 31, 2020, Standard & Poor’s Financial Services LLC (S&P), Moody’s Investors Service, Inc. (Moody’s) and Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch), assigned credit ratings to our outstanding senior notes of A– with a stable outlook, Baa1 with a stable outlook and BBB+ with a stable outlook, respectively, which are considered investment grade. Unfavorable changes to these ratings may have an adverse impact on future financings. During 2020, we issued debt with an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 billion. During 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any debt or debt securities. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we repaid debt of $6.5 billion, $4.5 billion and $1.1 billion, respectively. In addition, during 2020, we exchanged $0.7 billion of certain of our outstanding note issuances with $0.9 billion of newly issued notes with a lower interest rate and later maturity date. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the lives of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualify and are designated as fair value hedges. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.9 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term notes denominated in foreign currencies, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts, which effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayment of the respective notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts qualify and are designated as cash flow hedges. As of both December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion. 71 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                As of December 31, 2020, we had a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. During 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not issue any commercial paper. No commercial paper was outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. In 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) LIBOR plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The agreement contains provisions related to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phase-out or unavailability of designated reference rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. It is anticipated that LIBOR will be phased out and replaced by 2023. While various replacement reference rates have been discussed, an alternative reference rate to LIBOR has not yet been widely adopted. Therefore, the mechanics to modify existing contracts that reference LIBOR have not been finalized. We are currently evaluating the impact that the change in the reference rate will have on our financial condition. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our sales and operations are subject to the risks of doing business internationally, including in emerging markets. In February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the SEC that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depositary shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depositary shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023. Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant that requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2020. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Cash flows Our summarized cash flow activity was as follows (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Net cash provided by operating activities $ 10,497 $ 9,150 $ 11,296 Net cash (used in) provided by investing activities $ (5,401) $ 5,709 $ 14,339 Net cash used in financing activities $ (4,867) $ (15,767) $ (22,490) Operating Cash provided by operating activities has been and is expected to continue to be our primary recurring source of funds. Cash provided by operating activities increased during 2020 primarily due to higher Net income after adding back the noncash amortization related to the acquisition of Otezla®, the monetization of interest rate swap contracts and working capital adjustments. Cash provided by operating activities decreased during 2019 primarily due to changes in working capital, an increase in payments to the IRS related to an advance deposit and lower Net income. 72 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          Investing Cash used in investing activities during 2020 was primarily due to our $3.2 billion of purchases of equity method investments, primarily BeiGene, and net cash outflows related to marketable securities of $1.5 billion. Cash provided by investing activities during 2019 and 2018 was primarily due to net cash inflows related to marketable securities of $20.0 billion and $15.0 billion, respectively. The liquidation of portions of our marketable securities portfolio in 2019 was primarily the result of funding the acquisition of Otezla® and our investment in BeiGene and, in 2018, to fund our tender offer to repurchase our common stock. Capital expenditures were $608 million, $618 million and $738 million in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We currently estimate 2021 spending on capital projects to be approximately $900 million. A majority of the increase in expenditures relates to expansion of manufacturing capacity to enable supply of products and product candidates. Financing Cash used in financing activities during 2020 was primarily due to repayments of debt of $6.5 billion, the payment of dividends of $3.8 billion and payments to repurchase our common stock of $3.5 billion, partially offset by proceeds from issuance of debt of $8.9 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2019 was primarily due to repurchases of our common stock of $7.7 billion, repayments of debt of $4.5 billion and payments of dividends of $3.5 billion. Cash used in financing activities during 2018 was primarily due to repurchases of common stock of $17.8 billion, payments of dividends of $3.5 billion and repayments of debt of $1.1 billion. See Part IV—Note 9, Investments, Note 15, Financing arrangements, and Note 16, Stockholders’ equity, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Off-Balance Sheet Arrangements We do not have any off-balance sheet arrangements that are material or reasonably likely to become material to our consolidated financial position or consolidated results of operations. 73 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            Contractual Obligations Contractual obligations represent future cash commitments and liabilities under agreements with third parties and exclude contingent liabilities for which we cannot reasonably predict future payment. Additionally, the expected timing of payment of the obligations presented below is estimated based on current information. Timing of payments and actual amounts paid may be different depending on the timing of receipt of goods or services or changes to agreed-upon terms or amounts for some obligations. The following table represents our contractual obligations aggregated by type (in millions): Payments due by period as of December 31, 2020 Contractual obligations Total Year 1 Years 2 and 3 Years 4 and 5 Years 6 and beyond Long-term debt obligations(1)(2) Operating lease obligations(3) $ 54,293 864 $ 1,207 166 $ 7,857 268 $ 4,944 102 $ 40,285 328 Purchase obligations(4) U.S. repatriation tax(5) Unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs)(6) 2,697 5,575 — 2,129 587 — 375 1,687 — 121 3,301 — 72 — — Total contractual obligations $ 63,429 $ 4,089 $ 10,187 $ 8,468 $ 40,685 (1) Long-term debt obligations includes future interest payments on our fixed-rate obligations at the contractual coupon rates. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we enter into interest rate swap contracts that effectively convert a fixed-rate interest coupon for certain of our debt issuances to a floating LIBOR-based coupon over the terms of the related hedge contracts. We used an interest rate forward curve as of December 31, 2020, in computing net amounts to be paid or received under our interest rate swap contracts, which resulted in an aggregate net decrease in future interest payments of $67 million. See Part IV—Note 15, Financing arrangements, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (2) Long-term debt obligations includes contractual interest payments and principal repayments of our foreign-denominated debt obligations. In order to hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated long-term debt, we entered into cross-currency swap contracts that effectively converted interest payments and principal repayments on this debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. For purposes of this table, we used the contracted exchange rates in the cross-currency swap contracts to compute the net amounts of future interest payments and principal repayments on this debt. See Part IV—Note 18, Derivative instruments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (3) Operating lease obligations includes payments for leases that have not yet commenced, net of lease incentives, and excludes $107 million of future receipts under noncancelable subleases of abandoned facilities. (4) Purchase obligations relates primarily to (i) R&D commitments (including those related to clinical trials) for new and existing products, (ii) capital expenditures and (iii) open purchase orders for the acquisition of goods and services in the ordinary course of business. Our obligation to pay certain of these amounts may be reduced based on certain future events. (5) Under the 2017 Tax Act, we elected to pay in eight annual installments the repatriation tax related primarily to our prior indefinitely invested earnings of our foreign operations. See Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments— Commitments–U.S. repatriation tax, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. (6) Liabilities for UTBs are not included in the table above because due to their nature there is a high degree of uncertainty regarding the timing of future cash outflows and other events that extinguish these liabilities. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. In addition to amounts in the table above, we are contractually obligated to pay additional amounts that in the aggregate are significant, upon the achievement of various development, regulatory and commercial milestones for agreements we have entered into with third parties, including contingent consideration incurred in the acquisitions of K-A and BioVex Group Inc. (BioVex). These payments are contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, substantially all of which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurring. These contingent payments have not been included in the table above, and except with respect to the fair value of the contingent consideration obligations, are not recorded on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2020, the maximum amount that may be payable in the future for agreements we have entered into with third parties is $5.4 billion, including $250 million of contingent consideration payments in connection with the acquisition of BioVex. 74 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Summary of Critical Accounting Policies The preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and the notes to the financial statements. Some of those judgments can be subjective and complex, and therefore, actual results could differ materially from those estimates under different assumptions or conditions. Product sales and sales deductions Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Amounts recorded in Accrued liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets for sales deductions were as follows (in millions): Rebates Chargebacks Other deductions Total Balance as of December 31, 2017 $ 1,867 $ 272 $ 108 $ 2,247 Amounts charged against product sales 6,180 6,926 1,180 14,286 Payments (5,458) (6,744) (1,161) (13,363) Balance as of December 31, 2018 2,589 454 127 3,170 Amounts charged against product sales 6,825 7,090 1,292 15,207 Payments (6,249) (6,985) (1,263) (14,497) Balance as of December 31, 2019 3,165 559 156 3,880 Amounts charged against product sales 9,167 8,223 1,818 19,208 Payments (8,353) (8,191) (1,735) (18,279) Balance as of December 31, 2020 $ 3,979 $ 591 $ 239 $ 4,809 For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, total sales deductions were 44%, 41% and 39% of gross product sales, respectively. The increase in the total sales deductions balance as of December 31, 2020, compared to December 31, 2019, was primarily driven by the increase in gross sales and the impact of higher U.S. commercial rebate rates. Included in the amounts are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-year sales due to changes in estimates. Such amounts represent less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. In the United States, we utilize wholesalers as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers such as physicians or their clinics, dialysis centers, hospitals and pharmacies. Products we sell in Europe are distributed principally to hospitals and/or wholesalers depending on the distribution practice in each country where the products are sold. We monitor the inventory levels of our products at our wholesalers by using data from our wholesalers and other third parties, and we believe wholesaler inventories have been maintained at appropriate levels (generally two to three weeks) given end-user demand. Accordingly, historical fluctuations in wholesaler inventory levels have not significantly affected our method of estimating sales deductions and returns. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given year, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Rebates include primarily amounts paid to payers and providers in the United States, including those paid to state Medicaid programs, and are based on contractual arrangements or statutory requirements that vary by product, by payer and by individual payer plans. As we sell products, we estimate the amount of rebate we will pay based on the product sold, contractual terms, estimated patient population, historical experience and wholesaler inventory levels; and we accrue these rebates in the period the related sales are recorded. We then adjust the rebate accruals as more information becomes available and to reflect actual claims experience. Estimating such rebates is complicated, in part because of the time delay between the date of sale and the actual settlement of the liability. We believe the methodology we use to accrue for rebates is reasonable and appropriate given current facts and circumstances, but actual results may differ. 75 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Wholesaler chargebacks relate to our contractual agreements to sell products to healthcare providers in the United States at fixed prices that are lower than the prices we charge wholesalers. When healthcare providers purchase our products through wholesalers at these reduced prices, wholesalers charge us for the difference between their purchase prices and the contractual prices between Amgen and the healthcare providers. The provision for chargebacks is based on the expected sales by our wholesaler customers to healthcare providers. Accruals for wholesaler chargebacks are less difficult to estimate than rebates are, and they closely approximate actual results because chargeback amounts are fixed at the date of purchase by the healthcare providers and because we generally settle the liability for these deductions within a few weeks. Product returns Returns are estimated by comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. In each of the past three years, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-year sales return provisions have historically been immaterial. Income taxes We provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. We recognize the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it is more likely than not that the tax position will be sustained on examination by the tax authorities based on the technical merits of the position. The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is measured based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of UTBs is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We believe our estimates for uncertain tax positions are appropriate and sufficient for any assessments that may result from examinations of our tax returns. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. Certain items are included in our tax return at different times than they are reflected in the financial statements, and they cause temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts. Such temporary differences create deferred tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets are generally items that can be used as a tax deduction or credit in the tax return in future years but for which we have already recorded the tax benefit in the consolidated financial statements. We establish valuation allowances against our deferred tax assets when the amount of expected future taxable income is not likely to support the use of the deduction or credit. Deferred tax liabilities are either (i) tax expenses recognized in the consolidated financial statements for which payment has been deferred, (ii) expenses for which we have already taken a deduction on the tax return but have not yet recognized in the consolidated financial statements or (iii) liabilities for the difference between the book basis and tax basis of the intangible assets acquired in many business combinations, as future expenses associated with these assets most often will not be tax deductible. We are a vertically integrated enterprise with operations in the United States and various foreign jurisdictions. We are subject to income tax in the jurisdictions where we conduct operations based on the tax laws and principles of such jurisdictions and the functions, risks and activities performed therein. Our pretax income is therefore attributed to domestic or foreign sources based on the operations performed and risks assumed in each location and the tax laws and principles of the respective taxing jurisdictions. For example, we conduct significant operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes, pertaining to manufacturing, distribution and other related functions to meet our worldwide product demand. Income from our operations in Puerto Rico is subject to tax incentive grants through 2035. As previously disclosed, in 2017 we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. However, we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process. In addition, in 2020 we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagree with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. The IRS audit for years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term. We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based 76 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. See Part IV—Note 6, Income taxes, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. Our operations are subject to the tax laws, regulations and administrative practices of the United States, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, U.S. state jurisdictions and other countries in which we do business. Significant changes in these rules could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—The adoption and interpretation of new tax legislation or exposure to additional tax liabilities could affect our profitability. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters such as intellectual property disputes, contractual disputes and class action suits that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in Part IV—Note 19, Contingencies and commitments, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these items, an adverse determination in one or more of these items currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows. Valuation of assets and liabilities in connection with acquisitions We have acquired and continue to acquire intangible assets in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions. These intangible assets consist primarily of technology associated with currently marketed human therapeutic products and IPR&D product candidates. Discounted cash flow models are typically used to determine the fair values of these intangible assets for purposes of allocating consideration paid to the net assets acquired in an acquisition. See Part IV—Note 2, Acquisitions, to the Consolidated Financial Statements. These models require the use of significant estimates and assumptions, including but not limited to: • determining the timing and expected costs to complete in-process projects, taking into account the stage of completion at the acquisition date; • projecting the probability and timing of obtaining marketing approval from the FDA and other regulatory agencies for product candidates; • estimating the timing of and future net cash flows from product sales resulting from completed products and in-process projects; and • developing appropriate discount rates to calculate the present values of the cash flows. We believe the fair values used to record intangible assets acquired in connection with business combinations and asset acquisitions are based on reasonable estimates and assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related valuation dates. Impairment of long-lived assets We review the carrying value of our property, plant and equipment and our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. If such circumstances exist, an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows to be generated by the long-lived asset is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists. If an asset is determined to be impaired, the loss is measured based on the difference between the asset’s fair value and its carrying value. We believe our estimations of future cash flows used for assessing impairment of long-lived assets are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments. 77 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Impairment of equity method investments We review the carrying value of our equity method investments whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an investment may not be recoverable. We record impairment losses on our equity method investments if we deem the impairment to be other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary based on various factors, including but not limited to, the length of time and the extent to which the fair value is below the carrying value, volatility of the security price, the financial condition of the issuer, changes in technology that may impair the earnings potential of the investment and our intent and ability to retain the investment to allow for a recovery in fair value. We believe our judgments used in assessing impairment of equity method investments are based on reasonable assumptions given the facts and circumstances as of the related dates of the assessments.

Item 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK We are exposed to market risks that may result from changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and prices of equity instruments as well as changes in general economic conditions in the countries where we conduct business. To reduce certain of these risks, we enter into various types of foreign currency and interest rate derivative hedging transactions as part of our risk management program. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. In the discussion that follows, we have assumed a hypothetical change in interest rates of 100 basis points from those as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Except as noted below, we have also assumed a hypothetical 20% change in foreign currency exchange rates against the U.S. dollar based on its position relative to other currencies as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. Interest-rate-sensitive financial instruments Our portfolio of available-for-sale investments as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, was composed of U.S. Treasury securities and money market mutual funds, and with respect to investments as of December 31, 2019, corporate debt securities and other short-term interest-bearing securities. The fair values of our available-for-sale investments were $9.8 billion and $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. Duration is a sensitivity measure that can be used to approximate the change in the value of a security that will result from a 100 basis point change in interest rates. Applying a duration model, a hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would not have resulted in a material reduction in the fair values of these securities. In addition, a hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would not result in a material effect on income in the respective ensuing year. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $33.0 billion and a fair value of $39.4 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding debt with a carrying value of $29.9 billion and a fair value of $33.7 billion. Our outstanding debt was composed almost entirely of debt with fixed interest rates. Changes in interest rates do not affect interest expense on fixed-rate debt. Changes in interest rates would, however, affect the fair values of fixed-rate debt. A hypothetical 100 basis point decrease in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would have resulted in increases of $4.5 billion and $3.0 billion, respectively, in the aggregate fair value of our outstanding debt on each of these dates. Analysis of the debt does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related interest rate swap contracts and cross-currency swap contracts, discussed below. To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that qualified and were designated for accounting purposes as fair value hedges for certain of our fixed-rate debt. These interest rate swap contracts effectively converted a fixed-rate interest coupon to a floating-rate LIBOR-based coupon over the life of the respective notes. Interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.9 billion and $9.6 billion were outstanding as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. A hypothetical 100 basis point increase in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would have resulted in reductions in fair values of approximately $230 million and $380 million, respectively, on our interest rate swap contracts on these dates. Analysis of the interest rate swap contracts does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in interest rates would have on the related fair values of debt that these interest-rate-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 78 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had outstanding cross-currency swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion that hedge our foreign-currency-denominated debt and related interest payments. These contracts effectively convert interest payments and principal repayment of this debt to U.S. dollars from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges. A hypothetical 100 basis point adverse movement in interest rates relative to interest rates as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of our cross-currency swap contracts of approximately $250 million and $280 million, respectively. Foreign-currency-sensitive financial instruments Our international operations are affected by fluctuations in the value of the U.S. dollar as compared to foreign currencies, predominantly the euro. Increases and decreases in our international product sales from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our international operating expenses. Increases and decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated assets from movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by the corresponding increases or decreases in our foreign-currency-denominated liabilities. To further reduce our net exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our results of operations, we enter into foreign currency forward, option and cross-currency swap contracts. As of December 31, 2020, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $4.8 billion and $5.4 billion, respectively. As of December 31, 2019, we had outstanding euro-, pound-sterling- and Swiss-franc-denominated debt with a principal carrying value and a fair value of $4.5 billion and $5.0 billion, respectively. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.1 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $1.0 billion. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in an increase in fair value of this debt of $1.0 billion on this date and a reduction in income in the ensuing year of $900 million. The impact on income from these hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would be substantially offset by the impact such changes would have on related cross-currency swap contracts, which are in place for the related foreign-currency-denominated debt. We have cross-currency swap contracts that are designated as cash flow hedges of our debt denominated in euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs with aggregate notional amounts of $4.8 billion as of both December 31, 2020 and 2019. A hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would have resulted in reductions in the fair values of these contracts of $1.1 billion and $1.0 billion on these dates, respectively. The impact of this hypothetical adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates on ensuing years’ income from these contracts would be fully offset by the corresponding hypothetical changes in the carrying amounts of the related hedged debt. We enter into foreign currency forward and options contracts that are designated for accounting purposes as cash flow hedges of certain anticipated foreign currency transactions. As of December 31, 2020, the fair values of these contracts were a $28 million asset and a $237 million liability. As of December 31, 2019, the fair values of these contracts were a $223 million asset and a $31 million liability. As of December 31, 2020, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.1 billion. As of December 31, 2019, we had primarily euro based open foreign currency forward contracts with notional amounts of $5.0 billion. With regard to foreign currency forward and option contracts that were open as of December 31, 2020, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2020, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of approximately $1.1 billion on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of approximately $420 million. With regard to contracts that were open as of December 31, 2019, a hypothetical 20% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates as of December 31, 2019, would have resulted in a reduction in fair value of these contracts of $930 million on this date and in the ensuing year, a reduction in income of $400 million. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on anticipated transactions that these foreign-currency-sensitive instruments were designed to offset. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had open short-duration foreign currency forward contracts that mature in less than one month, with notional amounts of $1.0 billion and $1.2 billion, respectively, that hedged fluctuations of certain assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies but were not designated as hedges for accounting purposes. These contracts had no material net unrealized gains or losses as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. With regard to these foreign currency forward contracts that were open as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, a hypothetical 5% adverse movement in foreign currency exchange rates compared with the U.S. dollar relative to exchange rates on these dates would not have a material effect on the fair values of these contracts or related income in the respective ensuing years. The analysis does not consider the impact that hypothetical changes in foreign currency exchange rates would have on assets and liabilities that these foreign-currency­sensitive instruments were designed to offset. 79 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Market-price-sensitive financial instruments As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we were exposed to price risk on equity securities included in our portfolio of investments, which were acquired primarily for the promotion of business and strategic objectives. These investments are generally in small-capitalization stocks in the biotechnology industry. Price risk relative to our equity investment portfolio as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, was not material. Counterparty credit risks Our financial instruments, including derivatives, are subject to counterparty credit risk, which we consider as part of the overall fair value measurement. Our financial risk management policy limits derivative transactions by requiring that transactions be made only with institutions with minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch; and it places exposure limits on the amount with any individual counterparty. In addition, we have an investment policy that limits investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings and places restriction on maturities and concentrations by asset class and issuer.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES We maintain “disclosure controls and procedures,” as such term is defined under the Securities Exchange Act Rule 13a-15(e), that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed in Amgen’s Exchange Act reports is recorded, processed, summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules and forms and that such information is accumulated and communicated to Amgen’s management, including its Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosures. In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, Amgen’s management recognized that any controls and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving the desired control objectives, and in reaching a reasonable level of assurance, Amgen’s management necessarily was required to apply its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of possible controls and procedures. We have carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management, including Amgen’s Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of Amgen’s disclosure controls and procedures. Based upon their evaluation and subject to the foregoing, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were effective as of December 31, 2020. Management determined that as of December 31, 2020, there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the fiscal quarter then ended that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting. Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting Management of the Company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as such term is defined in Rule 13a-15(f) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The Company’s internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with GAAP in the United States. However, all internal control systems, no matter how well designed, have inherent limitations. Therefore, even those systems determined to be effective can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation and reporting. Management assessed the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. In making this assessment, management used the criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (COSO) in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013 framework). Based on our assessment, management believes that the Company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. The effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting has been audited by Ernst & Young LLP, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their attestation report appearing below, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the Company’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020. 81 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm To the Stockholders and the Board of Directors of Amgen Inc. Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting We have audited Amgen Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control—Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion, Amgen Inc. (the Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on the COSO criteria. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheets of the Company as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 and our report dated February 8, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion The Company’s management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion. Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over Financial Reporting A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements. Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP Los Angeles, California February 8, 2021 82 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                Item 9B.

SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS AND MANAGEMENT AND RELATED STOCKHOLDER MATTERS Securities Authorized for Issuance Under Existing Equity Compensation Plans The following table sets forth certain information as of December 31, 2020, concerning the shares of our common stock that may be issued under any form of award granted under our equity compensation plans in effect as of December 31, 2020 (including upon the exercise of options, upon the vesting of awards of restricted stock units (RSUs) or when performance units are earned and related dividend equivalents have been granted).

In accordance with this formula, each option or stock appreciation right counts as one share, while each RSU, performance unit or dividend equivalent counts as 1.9 shares. The number under column (a) represents the actual number of shares issuable under our outstanding awards without giving effect to the fungible share-counting formula. The number under column (c) represents the number of shares available for issuance under this plan based on each such available share counting as one share. Commencing with the grants made in April 2012, RSUs and performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are payable in shares only to the extent and when the underlying RSUs vest or underlying performance units have been earned and the related shares are issued to the grantee. The performance units granted under this plan are earned based on the accomplishment of specified performance goals at the end of their respective three-year performance periods; the number of performance units granted represent target performance, and the maximum number of units that could be earned based on our performance is 200% of the performance units granted in 2018, 2019 and 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the number of outstanding awards under column (a) includes (i) 4,721,305 shares issuable upon the exercise of outstanding options with a weighted-average exercise price of $179.92; (ii) 3,256,390 shares issuable upon the vesting of outstanding RSUs (including 199,676 related dividend equivalents); and (iii) 1,913,007 shares subject to outstanding 2018, 2019 and 2020 performance units (including 93,738 related dividend equivalents). The weighted-average exercise price shown in column (b) is for the outstanding options only. The number of available shares under column (c) represents the number of shares that remain available for future issuance under this plan as of December 31, 2020, employing the fungible share formula and presumes the issuance of target shares under the performance units granted in 2018, 2019 and 2020 and related dividend equivalents. The numbers under columns (a) and (c) do not give effect to the additional shares that could be issuable in the event above target performance on the performance goals under these outstanding performance units is achieved. Maximum performance under these goals could result in 200% of target shares being awarded for performance units granted in 2018, 2019 and 2020. (2) This plan has terminated as to future grants. The number under column (a) with respect to this plan includes 5,913 shares issuable upon the settlement of deferred RSUs (including 1,160 related dividend equivalents). (3) The Amgen Profit Sharing Plan for Employees in Ireland (the Profit Sharing Plan) was approved by the Board of Directors on July 28, 2011. The Profit Sharing Plan permits eligible employees of the Company’s subsidiaries located in Ireland who participate in the Profit Sharing Plan to apply a portion of their qualifying bonus and salary to the purchase of the Company’s common stock on the open market at the market price by a third-party trustee as described in the Profit Sharing Plan. 84 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              Security Ownership of Directors and Executive Officers and Certain Beneficial Owners Information about security ownership of certain beneficial owners and management is incorporated by reference from the sections entitled SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS and SECURITY OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN BENEFICIAL OWNERS in our Proxy Statement.

Opinion on the Financial Statements We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Amgen Inc. (the Company) as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, stockholders’ equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, and the related notes and the financial statement schedule listed in the Index at Item 15(a)2 (collectively referred to as the “consolidated financial statements”). In our opinion, the consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the Company at December 31, 2020 and 2019, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2020, in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles. We also have audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2020, based on criteria established in Internal Control-Integrated Framework issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) and our report dated February 8, 2021 expressed an unqualified opinion thereon. Basis for Opinion These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on the Company’s financial statements based on our audits. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission and the PCAOB. We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether due to error or fraud. Our audits included performing procedures to assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to error or fraud, and performing procedures that respond to those risks. Such procedures included examining, on a test basis, evidence regarding the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. Our audits also included evaluating the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

As described in Note 1 to the financial statements under the caption “Product sales and sales deductions,” revenues from product sales are recognized net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively sales deductions), which are established at the time of sale. Auditing the estimation of sales deductions, which are netted against product sales, is complex, requires significant judgment, and the amounts involved are material to the financial statements taken as a whole. Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, and is based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which the Company expects to be entitled, which represents an amount that is net of accruals for estimated sales deductions. The estimated sales deductions are based on current contractual and statutory requirements, market events and trends, internal and external historical data, and forecasted customer buying patterns. We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal controls over the sales deduction processes. This included testing controls over management’s review of significant assumptions and inputs used in the estimate of sales deductions, including actual sales, contractual terms, historical experience, wholesaler inventory levels, demand data and estimated patient population. We also tested management’s controls over the accuracy of forecasting demand activity as well as the completeness and accuracy of the significant components included in the final sales deduction estimates. To test management’s estimated sales deductions, we obtained management’s calculations for the respective estimates and performed the following procedures, among others. We tested management’s estimation process over the determination of sales discount accruals by developing an independent expectation of the estimated accrual balances, including comparing accrual balances recorded by management to those implied by historical payment trends, performing a lookback analysis using actual historical data to evaluate the forecasted amounts, assessing subsequent events to determine whether there was any new information that would require adjustment to the initial accruals, evaluating trends in actual sales and discount accrual balances, comparing cash receipts to product sales, confirming terms and conditions for a sample of contracts with the Company’s customers, testing a sample of credits issued and payments made throughout the year, and agreeing rates to underlying contract terms.

In this regard, the Company uses significant judgment in (1) determining whether a tax position’s technical merits are more-likely-than-not to be sustained and (2) measuring the amount of tax benefit that qualifies for recognition. As of December 31, 2020, the Company accrued $3.4 billion of gross unrecognized tax benefits including transfer pricing. Auditing the assessment of the technical merits and measurement of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits is challenging because they can be complex, highly judgmental, and based on interpretations of tax laws and regulations and application of those interpretations to the Company’s facts and circumstances. How We We obtained an understanding, evaluated the design and tested the operating effectiveness of internal Addressed the controls over the Company’s process to assess the technical merits of its tax positions, as well as Matter in Our management’s process to measure the unrecognized tax benefits of those tax positions, particularly in Audit regard to transfer pricing. This included testing controls over management’s review of the inputs, calculations, assumptions and methods selected to measure the amount of tax benefits that qualify for recognition. We involved tax and transfer pricing professionals to assist in assessing the technical merits and measurement of certain of the Company’s unrecognized tax benefits. Depending on the nature of the specific tax position and, as applicable, developments with the relevant tax authorities, our procedures included obtaining and reviewing the Company’s correspondence with such tax authorities and evaluating certain third-party advice to support the Company’s evaluations and recorded positions. We used our knowledge of and experience with how the income tax laws and regulations related to transfer pricing are applied by the relevant tax authorities to evaluate the Company’s accounting for its unrecognized tax benefits. We evaluated developments in the applicable regulatory environments to assess potential effects on the Company’s recorded positions. We analyzed the assumptions and data used by the Company when it determined the amount of tax benefits to recognize, including applicable interest and penalties, and we tested the accuracy of those underlying calculations. We have also evaluated the Company’s income tax disclosures included in Note 6 in relation to these matters. /s/ Ernst & Young LLP We have served as the Company’s auditor since 1980.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS December 31, 2020 1. Summary of significant accounting policies Business Amgen Inc. (including its subsidiaries, referred to as “Amgen,” “the Company,” “we,” “our” or “us”) is a global biotechnology pioneer that discovers, develops, manufactures and delivers innovative human therapeutics. We operate in one business segment: human therapeutics. Principles of consolidation The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Amgen as well as its majority-owned subsidiaries. We do not have any significant interests in any variable interest entities. All material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation. Use of estimates The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual results may differ from those estimates. Revenues Product sales and sales deductions Revenue from product sales is recognized upon transfer of control of a product to a customer, generally upon delivery, based on an amount that reflects the consideration to which we expect to be entitled, net of accruals for estimated rebates, wholesaler chargebacks, discounts and other deductions (collectively, sales deductions) and returns established at the time of sale. We analyze the adequacy of our accruals for sales deductions quarterly. Amounts accrued for sales deductions are adjusted when trends or significant events indicate that an adjustment is appropriate. Accruals are also adjusted to reflect actual results. Accruals for sales deductions are based primarily on estimates of the amounts earned or to be claimed on the related sales. These estimates take into consideration current contractual and statutory requirements, specific known market events and trends, internal and external historical data and forecasted customer buying patterns. Sales deductions are substantially product specific and therefore, for any given period, can be affected by the mix of products sold. Included in sales deductions are immaterial net adjustments related to prior-period sales due to changes in estimates. Historically, such amounts have represented less than 1% of the aggregate sales deductions charged against product sales. Returns are estimated through comparison of historical return data to their related sales on a production lot basis. Historical rates of return are determined for each product and are adjusted for known or expected changes in the marketplace specific to each product, when appropriate. Historically, sales return provisions have amounted to less than 1% of gross product sales. Changes in estimates for prior-period sales return provisions have historically been immaterial. Our payment terms vary by types and locations of customers and the products or services offered. Payment terms differ by jurisdiction and customer, but payment is generally required in a term ranging from 30 to 120 days from date of shipment or satisfaction of the performance obligation. For certain products or services and certain customer types, we may require payment before products are delivered or services are rendered to customers. Indirect taxes collected from customers and remitted to government authorities and that are related to sales of the Company’s products, primarily in Europe, are excluded from revenues. As a practical expedient, sales commissions are expensed when incurred because the amortization period would have been one year or less. These costs are recorded in Selling, general and administrative (SG&A) expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Royalties from licensees are based on third-party sales of licensed products and are recorded when the related third-party product sale occurs. Royalty income is estimated based on historical and forecasted sales trends. Corporate partner revenues are composed mainly of license fees and milestones earned and our share of commercial profits generated from collaborations. See Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations, discussed below. Arrangements with multiple-performance obligations From time to time, we enter into arrangements for the research and development (R&D), manufacture and/or commercialization of products and product candidates. Such arrangements may require us to deliver various rights, services and/or goods, including intellectual property rights/licenses, R&D services, manufacturing services and/or commercialization services. The underlying terms of these arrangements generally provide for consideration to Amgen in the form of nonrefundable, upfront license fees; development and commercial performance milestone payments; royalty payments; and/or profit sharing. In arrangements involving more than one performance obligation, each required performance obligation is evaluated to determine whether it qualifies as a distinct performance obligation based on whether (i) the customer can benefit from the good or service either on its own or together with other resources that are readily available and (ii) the good or service is separately identifiable from other promises in the contract. The consideration under the arrangement is then allocated to each separate distinct performance obligation based on its respective relative stand-alone selling price. The estimated selling price of each deliverable reflects our best estimate of what the selling price would be if the deliverable was regularly sold by us on a stand­alone basis or by using an adjusted market assessment approach if selling price on a stand-alone basis is not available. The consideration allocated to each distinct performance obligation is recognized as revenue when control of the related goods or services is transferred. Consideration associated with at-risk substantive performance milestones is recognized as revenue when it is probable that a significant reversal of the cumulative revenue recognized will not occur. We utilize the sales-and usage-based royalty exception in arrangements that resulted from the license of intellectual property, recognizing revenues generated from royalties or profit sharing as the underlying sales occur. Research and development costs R&D costs are expensed as incurred and primarily include salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs; facilities and overhead costs; clinical trial and related clinical manufacturing costs; contract services and other outside costs; information systems’ costs; and amortization of acquired technology used in R&D with alternative future uses. R&D expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with third-party R&D arrangements, including upfront fees and milestones paid to third parties in connection with technologies that had not reached technological feasibility and did not have an alternative future use. Net payment or reimbursement of R&D costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or as we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations. Selling, general and administrative costs SG&A costs are primarily composed of salaries, benefits and other staff-related costs associated with sales and marketing, finance, legal and other administrative personnel; facilities and overhead costs; outside marketing, advertising and legal expenses; the U.S. healthcare reform federal excise fee on Branded Prescription Pharmaceutical Manufacturers and Importers; and other general and administrative costs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and were $962 million, $789 million and $674 million during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. SG&A expenses also include costs and cost recoveries associated with marketing and promotion efforts under certain collaborative arrangements. Net payment or reimbursement of SG&A costs is recognized when the obligations are incurred or we become entitled to the cost recovery. See Note 8, Collaborations.

This new standard requires that lessees recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases on the balance sheet, including leases classified as operating leases, and that they disclose qualitative and quantitative information about leasing arrangements. The FASB subsequently issued additional amendments to address issues arising from the implementation of the new lease standard. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2019, using the modified-retrospective method, which provides a method for recording existing leases at adoption. We used the adoption date as our date of initial application, and thus, comparative-period financial information is not presented for periods prior to the adoption date. In addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition guidance within the new standard, which, among other things, allowed us to carry forward the historical lease classification. Adoption of the new standard resulted in total lease liabilities of $510 million and right-of-use (ROU) assets of $439 million as of January 1, 2019. The difference between the initial lease liabilities and the ROU assets is primarily related to previously existing lease liabilities. The standard did not materially impact our Consolidated Statements of Income and had no impact on our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Our accounting policies under the new standard are described below. See Note 13, Leases. Lease recognition At inception of a contract, we determine whether an arrangement is or contains a lease. For all leases, we determine the classification as either operating or financing. Operating leases are included in Other assets, Accrued liabilities and Other noncurrent liabilities in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term, and lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments under the lease. Lease recognition occurs at the commencement date, and lease liability amounts are based on the present value of lease payments made during the lease term. Our lease terms may include options to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise that option. Because most of our leases do not provide information to determine an implicit interest rate, we use our incremental borrowing rate in determining the present value of lease payments. ROU assets also include any lease payments made prior to the commencement date less lease incentives received. Operating lease expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term. We have lease agreements with both lease and nonlease components, which are generally accounted for together as a single lease component. In addition, for certain vehicle and equipment leases, we apply a portfolio approach to determine the lease term and discount rate. Stock-based compensation We have stock-based compensation plans under which various types of equity-based awards are granted, including restricted stock units (RSUs), performance units and stock options. The fair values of RSUs and stock option awards, which are subject only to service conditions with graded vesting, are recognized as compensation expense, generally on a straight-line basis over the service period, net of estimated forfeitures. The fair values of performance unit awards are recognized as compensation expense, generally on a straight-line basis from the grant date to the end of the performance period. See Note 4, Stock-based compensation. Income taxes We provide for income taxes based on pretax income and applicable tax rates in the various jurisdictions in which we operate. Significant judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes and income tax assets and liabilities, including evaluating uncertainties in the application of accounting principles and complex tax laws. Deferred income taxes are recorded for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the bases of assets and liabilities, as well as for loss and tax credit carryforwards for financial reporting purposes and amounts recognized for income tax purposes. We record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized.

The tax benefit recognized in the consolidated financial statements for a particular tax position is based on the largest benefit that is more likely than not to be realized. The amount of unrecognized tax benefits (UTBs) is adjusted as appropriate for changes in facts and circumstances, such as significant amendments to existing tax law, new regulations or interpretations by tax authorities, new information obtained during a tax examination or resolution of an examination. We recognize both accrued interest and penalties, where appropriate, related to UTBs in income tax expense. See Note 6, Income taxes. Acquisitions We first determine whether a set of assets acquired constitute a business and should be accounted for as a business combination. If the assets acquired are not a business, we account for the transaction as an asset acquisition. Business combinations are accounted for by using the acquisition method of accounting. Under the acquisition method, assets acquired, including in-process research and development (IPR&D) projects, and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values as of the acquisition date in our consolidated financial statements. The excess of the fair value of consideration transferred over the fair value of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with a business combination (including the assumption of an acquiree’s liability arising from an acquisition it consummated prior to our acquisition) are recorded at their fair values on the acquisition date and remeasured at their fair values each subsequent reporting period until the related contingencies are resolved. The resulting changes in fair values are recorded in earnings. In contrast, asset acquisitions are accounted for using a cost accumulation and allocation model. Under this model, the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed. Contingent consideration obligations incurred in connection with an asset acquisition are recorded when it is probable that they will occur and they can be reasonably estimated. See Note 2, Acquisitions, and Note 17, Fair value measurement. Cash equivalents We consider cash equivalents to be only those investments that are highly liquid, readily convertible to cash and which mature within three months from the date of purchase. Interest-bearing securities We consider our interest-bearing securities investment portfolio available-for-sale, and accordingly, these investments are recorded at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in Accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) (AOCI). Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets due to their highly liquid nature and because they represent the Company’s investments that are available for current operations. See Note 9, Investments, and Note 17, Fair value measurement. Inventories Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost, which includes amounts related to materials, labor and overhead, is determined in a manner that approximates the first-in, first-out method. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion, disposal and transportation. See Note 10, Inventories. Derivatives We recognize all of our derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities at fair value in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative instrument depends on whether the derivative has been formally designated and qualifies as part of a hedging relationship under the applicable accounting standards and, further, on the type of hedging relationship. For derivatives formally designated as hedges, we assess both at inception and quarterly thereafter whether the hedging derivatives are highly effective in offsetting changes in either the fair value or cash flows of the hedged item. Our derivatives that are not designated and do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through current earnings. See Note 17, Fair value measurement, and Note 18, Derivative instruments. Property, plant and equipment, net Property, plant and equipment is recorded at historical cost, net of accumulated depreciation, amortization and, if applicable, impairment charges. We review our property, plant and equipment assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Depreciation is provided over the assets’ useful lives on a straight-line basis. Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or lease terms. See Note 11, Property, plant and equipment.

Amortization of finite-lived intangible assets is provided over their estimated useful lives on a straight-line basis or based on the pattern in which economic benefits are consumed, if reliably determinable. We review our finite-lived intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. See Note 12, Goodwill and other intangible assets. The fair values of IPR&D projects acquired in a business combination that are not complete are capitalized and accounted for as indefinite-lived intangible assets until completion or abandonment of the related R&D efforts. Upon successful completion of the project, the capitalized amount is amortized over its estimated useful life. If a project is abandoned, all remaining capitalized amounts are written off immediately. There are often major risks and uncertainties associated with IPR&D projects as we are required to obtain regulatory approvals in order to be able to market the resulting products. Such approvals require completing clinical trials that demonstrate a product candidate is safe and effective. Consequently, the eventual realized value of the acquired IPR&D project may vary from its fair value at the date of acquisition, and IPR&D impairment charges may occur in future periods. Capitalized IPR&D projects are tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. We consider various factors for potential impairment, including the current legal and regulatory environment and the competitive landscape. Adverse clinical trial results, significant delays in obtaining marketing approval, the inability to bring a product to market and the introduction or advancement of competitors’ products could result in partial or full impairment of the related intangible assets. We perform an impairment test of goodwill annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. To date, an impairment of goodwill has not been recorded. See Note 12, Goodwill and other intangible assets. Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. Certain of these proceedings are discussed in Note 19, Contingencies and commitments. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously. Foreign currency translation The net assets of international subsidiaries whose local currencies have been determined to be the functional currencies are translated into U.S. dollars using current exchange rates. The U.S. dollar effects that arise from translating net assets of these subsidiaries at changing rates are recognized in AOCI. The subsidiaries’ earnings are translated into U.S. dollars using average exchange rates. Equity method investments The equity method of accounting is used for equity investments that give us the ability to exert significant influence, but not control, over an investee based on such factors as our ownership percentage, voting and other shareholder rights, board of director representation and the existence of other collaborative or business relationships. The equity method of accounting requires us to allocate the difference between the fair value of securities acquired and our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying assets (the basis difference) to various items and amortize such differences over their useful lives. Our share of the investees’ earnings or losses and amortization of basis differences, if any, are recorded one quarter in arrears in Interest and other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. We record impairment losses on our equity method investments if we deem the impairment to be other-than-temporary. We deem an impairment to be other-than-temporary based on various factors, including but not limited to, the length of time the fair value is below the carrying value, volatility of the security price and our intent and ability to retain the investment to allow for a recovery in fair value.

Accordingly, these financial assets are now presented at the net amount expected to be collected. This new standard also requires that credit losses related to available-for-sale debt securities be recorded as an allowance through net income rather than reducing the carrying amount under the former other-than-temporary-impairment model. We adopted this standard as of January 1, 2020, using a modified-retrospective approach. Adoption of the standard did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. In March 2020, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to ease the financial reporting burdens of the expected market transition from the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) and other interbank offered rates to alternative reference rates, commonly referred to as reference rate reform. The new standard provides temporary optional expedients and exceptions to current GAAP guidance on contract modifications and hedge accounting. Specifically, a modification to transition to an alternative reference rate is treated as an event that does not require contract remeasurement or reassessment of a previous accounting treatment. Moreover, for all types of hedging relationships, an entity may change the reference rate without having to dedesignate the hedging relationship. The standard is generally effective for all contract modifications made and hedging relationships evaluated through December 31, 2022. In January 2021, the FASB issued a new accounting standard to expand on the scope of the original March 2020 standard to include derivative instruments on discounting transactions. We are currently evaluating the impact that both standards will have on our consolidated financial statements. 2. Acquisitions Otezla® (apremilast) On November 21, 2019, we acquired worldwide rights to Otezla®, the only oral, non-biologic treatment for psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis, along with certain related assets and liabilities, from Celgene Corporation (Celgene). Otezla® is primarily used for the treatment of patients with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis for whom phototherapy or systemic therapy is appropriate and is approved in more than 50 markets outside the United States, including the European Union and Japan. The acquisition was accounted for as an asset acquisition under GAAP because substantially all of the value of the assets acquired was concentrated in the global intellectual property rights of Otezla®. The operations of Otezla® have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date. The following table summarizes the consideration transferred and the allocation of the estimated accumulated cost, including tax adjustments, to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed (in millions): Amounts Cash purchase price $ 13,400 Transaction costs 40 Accumulated cost (consideration transferred) $ 13,440 Intangible assets: Developed-product-technology rights $ 13,007 Marketing-related rights 195 Inventory 367 Deferred tax liability, net (24) Deferred credit (96) Other liabilities, net (9) Total assets acquired, net $ 13,440 Amgen allocated the accumulated cost of the acquisition to the assets acquired based on their relative fair values. The accumulated cost of the acquisition includes direct acquisition-related costs and applicable taxes. Goodwill is not recognized in the accounting for an asset acquisition. Rather, the excess of the accumulated cost over the fair value of the net assets acquired is reallocated to the nonfinancial assets acquired.

The estimated fair value was determined by using a multi-period excess earnings income approach, which is based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable only to the intangible asset. The developed-product-technology rights will be amortized over a weighted-average period of 8.5 years by using the straight-line method. The estimated fair value of marketing-related rights, which relate to assembled workforce, was determined using a replacement cost approach, which consists of developing an estimate of the current cost of a similar new asset having the nearest equivalent utility to the asset being valued. The assembled workforce will be amortized over a period of 5 years by using the straight-line method. The estimated fair value of the acquired inventory was determined using the comparative sales method, which uses actual or expected selling prices of inventory as the base amount to which adjustments for selling effort and a profit on the buyer’s effort are applied. Inventory fair value adjustments will be amortized as inventory turns over, which we estimate to approximate 2.5 years. Upon closing, we had a difference between the book basis and tax basis of the assets acquired. The Company used the simultaneous equations method to determine the assigned value of the net assets acquired and the related deferred tax assets or liabilities. Use of this methodology resulted in an increase to the carrying value of the intangible assets of $119 million, a net deferred tax liability of $24 million and a deferred credit of $96 million. The tax effects of the acquisition are based on Amgen’s estimated blended statutory tax rate of 20%. Nuevolution AB On July 15, 2019, we acquired all of the outstanding stock of Nuevolution AB (Nuevolution), a publicly traded, Denmark-based biotechnology company with a leading small molecule drug discovery platform, for total consideration of $183 million in cash. The transaction, which was accounted for as a business combination, expands our ability to discover novel small molecules against difficult-to-drug targets and with greater speed and efficiency. Nuevolution’s operations, which are not material, have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the acquisition date. We allocated the consideration to acquire Nuevolution to finite-lived intangible assets of $150 million, primarily comprised of technology rights for a drug discovery platform with an estimated useful life of 10 years; goodwill of $26 million, which is not tax deductible; deferred tax liabilities of $22 million; and other net assets of $29 million. The estimated fair values of intangible assets were determined primarily by using a probability-weighted-income approach, which discounts expected future cash flows to present value by using a discount rate that represents the estimated rate that market participants would use to value the intangible assets. Kirin-Amgen, Inc. During the first quarter of 2018, we acquired the remaining 50% ownership of Kirin-Amgen, Inc. (K-A), from Kirin Holdings Company, Limited (Kirin), making K-A a wholly owned subsidiary of Amgen. Upon the acquisition, K-A’s operations have been included in our consolidated financial statements commencing on the share acquisition date. The acquisition relieved Amgen of future royalty obligations to K-A. Prior to the share acquisition date, we owned 50% of K-A and accounted for our interest in K-A by using the equity method of accounting. The transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition of a business in which we were required to remeasure our existing 50% ownership interest at fair value. In addition, we were required to effectively settle our preexisting relationship with K-A, which resulted in a loss. Together the gain on the remeasurement of our existing ownership interest and the loss from the settlement of the preexisting relationship resulted in a net gain of $80 million, which was recorded in Interest and other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The aggregate share acquisition date consideration to acquire the remaining 50% ownership in K-A and the fair value of Amgen’s preacquisition investment consisted of the following (in millions): Amounts Total cash paid to Kirin $ 780 Fair value of contingent consideration obligation 45 Loss on settlement of preexisting relationship (168) Total consideration transferred to acquire K-A 657 Fair value of Amgen’s investment in K-A Total acquisition date fair value $ 1,482 In connection with this acquisition, we are obligated to make single-digit royalty payments to Kirin contingent upon sales of brodalumab. The estimated fair value of this contingent consideration obligation was $45 million as of the share acquisition date. The fair values of assets acquired and liabilities assumed consisted of cash of $977 million, licensing rights of $470 million, deferred tax liabilities of $102 million, other assets and liabilities of $131 million and goodwill of $6 million. The estimated fair value of acquired licensing rights was determined by using a probability-related-income approach, which is based on the present value of the incremental after-tax cash flows attributable only to the intangible asset. The projected cash flows were based on certain assumptions, including estimates of future revenues and expenses and the time and resources needed to maintain the assets through commercialization. The licensing rights will be amortized over a weighted-average period of four years by using the straight-line method. The excess of the share acquisition date consideration over the fair values assigned to the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed of $6 million was recorded as goodwill, which is not deductible for tax purposes. The $131 million in other assets and liabilities primarily represents receivables for royalties earned by K-A but not yet received, partially offset by payables representing R&D expenses incurred but not yet reimbursed by K-A. Pro forma results of operations for this acquisition have not been presented because this acquisition was not material to our consolidated results of operations.

In the United States, we sell primarily to pharmaceutical wholesale distributors that we utilize as the principal means of distributing our products to healthcare providers. Outside the United States, we sell principally to healthcare providers and/or pharmaceutical wholesale distributors depending on the distribution practice in each country. We monitor the financial condition of our larger customers and limit our credit exposure by setting credit limits and, in certain circumstances, by requiring letters of credit or obtaining credit insurance.

Certain information with respect to these customers was as follows (dollar amounts in millions): Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 AmerisourceBergen Corporation: Gross product sales $ 14,743 $ 12,301 $ 12,091 % of total gross revenues 34 % 33 % 33 % McKesson Corporation: Gross product sales $ 13,779 $ 11,795 $ 11,434 % of total gross revenues 32 % 31 % 31 % Cardinal Health, Inc.: Gross product sales % of total gross revenues 17 % 17 % 20 % $ 7,332 $ 6,538 $ 7,475 As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, amounts due from these three customers each exceeded 10% of gross trade receivables and accounted for 74% and 73%, respectively, of net trade receivables on a combined basis. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 28% and 27%, respectively, of net trade receivables were due from customers located outside the United States, the majority of which were from Europe. Our total allowance for doubtful accounts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, was not material. 4. Stock-based compensation Our Amended and Restated 2009 Equity Incentive Plan (the Amended 2009 Plan) authorizes for issuance to employees of Amgen and nonemployee members of our Board of Directors shares of our common stock pursuant to grants of equity-based awards, including RSUs, stock options and performance units. The pool of shares available under the Amended 2009 Plan is reduced by one share for each stock option granted and by 1.9 shares for other types of awards granted, including RSUs and performance units (full-value awards). In general, if any shares subject to an award granted under the Amended 2009 Plan expire or become forfeited, terminated or canceled without the issuance of shares, the shares subject to such awards are added back into the authorized pool on the same basis that they were removed. In addition, under the Amended 2009 Plan, shares withheld to pay for minimum statutory tax obligations with respect to full-value awards are added back into the authorized pool on the basis of 1.9 shares. As of December 31, 2020, the Amended 2009 Plan provides for future grants and/or issuances of up to approximately 23 million shares of our common stock. Stock-based awards under our employee compensation plans are made with newly issued shares reserved for this purpose. The following table reflects the components of stock-based compensation expense recognized in our Consolidated Statements of Income (in millions): Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 RSUs $ 178 $ 168 $ 165 Performance units 118 105 117 Stock options 34 35 29 Total stock-based compensation expense, pretax 330 308 311 Tax benefit from stock-based compensation expense (72) (67) (67) Total stock-based compensation expense, net of tax $ 258 $ 241 $ 244 Restricted stock units and stock options Eligible employees generally receive an annual grant of RSUs and, for certain executive-level employees, stock options, with the size and type of award generally determined by the employee’s salary grade and performance level. Certain management and professional-level employees typically receive RSU grants upon commencement of employment. Nonemployee members of our Board of Directors also receive an annual grant of RSUs.

RSUs and stock options generally vest in equal amounts on the second, third and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. RSUs accrue dividend equivalents, which are typically payable in shares only when and to the extent the underlying RSUs vest and are issued to the recipient. Restricted stock units The grant date fair value of an RSU equals the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, as RSUs accrue dividend equivalents during their vesting period. The weighted-average grant date fair values per unit of RSUs granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $235.63, $182.12 and $179.18, respectively. The following table summarizes information regarding our RSUs: Year ended December 31, 2020 Weighted-average Units grant date (in millions) fair value Balance nonvested as of December 31, 2019 3.1 $ 174.97 Granted 1.1 $ 235.63 Vested (1.0) $ 167.23 Forfeited (0.2) $ 190.15 Balance nonvested as of December 31, 2020 3.0 $ 198.11 The total grant date fair values of RSUs that vested during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $161 million, $160 million and $167 million, respectively. Stock options The exercise price of stock options is set as the closing price of our common stock on the grant date, and the related number of shares granted is fixed at that point in time. Awards expire 10 years from the date of grant. We use the Black– Scholes option valuation model to estimate the grant date fair value of stock options. The weighted-average assumptions used in the option valuation model and the resulting weighted-average grant date fair values of stock options granted were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Closing price of our common stock on grant date $ 236.36 $ 177.31 $ 177.46 Expected volatility (average of implied and historical volatility) 28.1 % 23.5 % 24.6 % Expected life (in years) 5.8 5.8 5.8 Risk-free interest rate 0.4 % 2.4 % 2.8 % Expected dividend yield 3.0 % 3.1 % 2.9 % Fair value of stock options granted $ 42.34 $ 30.47 $ 34.60 F-19 \f                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    The following table summarizes information regarding our stock options: Year ended December 31, 2020 Balance unexercised as of December 31, 2019 Options(in millions) 4.8 Weighted-averageexercise price $ 157.00 Weighted-averageremainingcontractual life (in years) Aggregateintrinsic value (in millions) Granted 1.0 $ 236.36 Exercised Expired/forfeited Balance unexercised as of December 31, 2020 (0.9) (0.2) 4.7 $ 117.90 $ 178.36 $ 179.90 7.3 $ 243 Vested or expected to vest as of December 31, 2020 4.5 $ 178.37 7.3 $ 239 Exercisable as of December 31, 2020 1.5 $ 150.80 5.5 $ 120 The total intrinsic values of options exercised during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $98 million, $68 million and $53 million, respectively. The actual tax benefits realized from tax deductions from option exercises during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $21 million, $15 million and $12 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, $345 million of unrecognized compensation cost was related to nonvested RSUs and unvested stock options, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.8 years. Performance units Certain management-level employees also receive annual grants of performance units, which give the recipient the right to receive common stock that is contingent upon achievement of specified preestablished goals over the performance period, which is generally three years. The performance goals for the units granted during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, which are accounted for as equity awards, are based on (i) Amgen’s stockholder return compared with a comparator group of companies, which are considered market conditions and are therefore reflected in the grant date fair values of the units, and (ii) Amgen’s stand-alone financial performance measures, which are considered performance conditions. The expense recognized for awards is based on the grant date fair value of a unit multiplied by the number of units expected to be earned with respect to the related performance conditions, net of estimated forfeitures. Depending on the outcome of these performance goals, a recipient may ultimately earn a number of units greater or less than the number of units granted. Shares of our common stock are issued on a one-for-one basis for each performance unit earned. In general, performance unit awards vest at the end of the performance period. The performance award program provides for accelerated or continued vesting in certain circumstances as defined in the plan, including upon death, disability, a change in control and retirement of employees who meet certain service and/or age requirements. Performance units accrue dividend equivalents that are typically payable in shares only when and to the extent the underlying performance units vest and are issued to the recipient, including with respect to market and performance conditions that affect the number of performance units earned. We use a payout simulation model to estimate the grant date fair value of performance units. The weighted-average assumptions used in the payout simulation model and the resulting weighted-average grant date fair values of performance units granted were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Closing price of our common stock on grant date $ 236.36 $ 177.31 $ 177.93 Volatility 27.5 % 22.1 % 23.8 % Risk-free interest rate 0.2 % 2.3 % 2.6 % Fair value of units granted $ 249.07 $ 188.40 $ 189.21 The payout simulation model assumes correlations of returns of the stock prices of our common stock and the common stocks of the comparator groups of companies and stock price volatilities of the comparator groups of companies to simulate stockholder returns over the performance periods and their resulting impact on the payout percentages based on the contractual terms of the performance units.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, 0.6 million performance units with a weighted-average grant date fair value per unit of $249.07 were granted, and 0.1 million performance units with a weighted-average grant date fair value per unit of $199.86 were forfeited. The total fair values of performance units paid during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 were $230 million, $176 million and $133 million, respectively, based on the number of performance units earned multiplied by the closing stock price of our common stock on the last day of the performance period. As of December 31, 2020, $127 million of unrecognized compensation cost was related to nonvested performance units, which is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of one year. 5. Defined contribution plan The Company has defined contribution plans to which certain employees of the Company and participating subsidiaries may defer compensation for income tax purposes. Participants are eligible to receive matching contributions based on their contributions, in addition to other Company contributions.

Significant components of our deferred tax assets and liabilities were as follows (in millions): December 31, 2020 2019 Deferred income tax assets: NOL and credit carryforwards Accrued expenses Expenses capitalized for tax Stock-based compensation Other $ 794 561 144 92 301 $ 800 457 170 91 269 Total deferred income tax assets Valuation allowance Net deferred income tax assets 1,892 (571) 1,321 1,787 (517) 1,270 Deferred income tax liabilities: Acquired intangible assets (903) (1,288) Debt (282) (210) Fixed assets (148) (53) Other (189) (233) Total deferred income tax liabilities (1,522) (1,784) Total deferred income taxes, net $ (201) $ (514) Valuation allowances are provided to reduce the amounts of our deferred tax assets to an amount that is more likely than not to be realized based on an assessment of positive and negative evidence, including estimates of future taxable income necessary to realize future deductible amounts. The valuation allowance increased in 2020, primarily driven by the Company’s expectation that some state R&D credits will not be utilized and that certain foreign net operating losses will expire unused. As of December 31, 2020, we had $20 million of federal tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes and have provided no valuation allowance for those federal tax credit carryforwards. The federal tax credit carryforwards expire between 2023 and 2035. We had $681 million of state tax credit carryforwards available to reduce future state income taxes and have provided a valuation allowance for $585 million of those state tax credit carryforwards. As of December 31, 2020, we had $143 million of federal NOL carryforwards available to reduce future federal income taxes and have provided a valuation allowance for $6 million of those federal NOL carryforwards. The federal NOL carryforwards, for which no valuation allowance has been provided, expire between 2021 and 2035. We had $167 million of state NOL carryforwards available to reduce future state income taxes and have provided a valuation allowance for all of the state NOL carryforwards. We had $1.9 billion of foreign NOL carryforwards available to reduce future foreign income taxes and have provided a valuation allowance for $754 million of those foreign NOL carryforwards. For the foreign NOLs with no valuation allowance provided, $861 million has no expiry; and the remainder will expire between 2021 and 2030.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, we effectively settled certain issues with the IRS. As a result, we remeasured our UTBs accordingly. Interest and penalties related to UTBs are included in our provision for income taxes. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $116 million, $198 million and $137 million, respectively, of interest and penalties through the income tax provision in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The decrease in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2020 was primarily due to lower interest rates during 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, accrued interest and penalties associated with UTBs were $783 million and $667 million, respectively. The reconciliations between the federal statutory tax rate applied to income before income taxes and our effective tax rate were as follows: Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Federal statutory tax rate 21.0 % 21.0 % 21.0 % Foreign earnings (4.7)% (4.5)% (4.3)% Foreign-derived intangible income (0.7)% (0.7)% (0.4)% Credits, Puerto Rico Excise Tax (2.9)% (2.6)% (2.5)% 2017 Tax Act, net impact on intercompany sales — % — % (1.8)% Interest on uncertain tax positions 1.1 % 1.6 % 1.2 % Credits, primarily federal R&D (1.4)% (1.0)% (0.8)% Audit settlements (1.0)% — % (0.3)% Other, net (0.7)% 0.4 % — % Effective tax rate 10.7 % 14.2 % 12.1 % The effective tax rates for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 differ from the federal statutory rate primarily due to impacts of the jurisdictional mix of income and expenses. Substantially all of the benefit to our effective tax rate from foreign earnings results from the Company’s operations in Puerto Rico, a territory of the United States that is treated as a foreign jurisdiction for U.S. tax purposes. Our operations in Puerto Rico are subject to tax incentive grants through 2035. Additionally, the Company’s operations conducted in Singapore are subject to a tax incentive grant through 2034. Our foreign earnings are also subject to U.S. tax at a reduced rate of 10.5%. The U.S. territory of Puerto Rico imposes an excise tax on the gross intercompany purchase price of goods and services from our manufacturing site in Puerto Rico. The rate of 4% is effective through December 31, 2027. We account for the excise tax as a manufacturing cost that is capitalized in inventory and expensed in cost of sales when the related products are sold. For U.S. income tax purposes, the excise tax results in foreign tax credits that are generally recognized in our provision for income taxes when the excise tax is incurred. Income taxes paid during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $1.4 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

Our income tax returns are routinely examined by tax authorities in those jurisdictions. Significant disputes may arise with tax authorities involving issues regarding the timing and amount of deductions, the use of tax credits and allocations of income and expenses among various tax jurisdictions because of differing interpretations of tax laws, regulations and relevant facts. In 2017, we received a Revenue Agent Report (RAR) and a modified RAR from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012 proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico. We disagree with the proposed adjustments and calculations and have been pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. However, we have been unable to reach resolution at the administrative appeals level, and we anticipate that we will receive a Notice of Deficiency, which we would expect to vigorously contest through the judicial process. In addition, in 2020, we received an RAR and a modified RAR from the IRS for the years 2013, 2014 and 2015 also proposing significant adjustments that primarily relate to the allocation of profits between certain of our entities in the United States and the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico similar to those proposed for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012. We disagree with the 2013, 2014 and 2015 proposed adjustments and calculations and are pursuing resolution with the IRS administrative appeals office. The IRS audit for years 2016, 2017 and 2018 is expected to start in the near term. We are also currently under examination by a number of other state and foreign tax jurisdictions. Final resolution of these complex matters is not likely within the next 12 months. We believe our accrual for income tax liabilities is appropriate based on past experience, interpretations of tax law, application of the tax law to our facts and judgments about potential actions by tax authorities; however, due to the complexity of the provision for income taxes and uncertain resolution of these matters, the ultimate outcome of any tax matters may result in payments substantially greater than amounts accrued and could have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements. We are no longer subject to U.S. federal income tax examinations for years ended on or before December 31, 2009. 7. Earnings per share The computation of basic earnings per share (EPS) is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding. The computation of diluted EPS is based on the weighted-average number of our common shares outstanding and dilutive potential common shares, which primarily include shares that may be issued under our stock option, restricted stock and performance unit award programs (collectively, dilutive securities), as determined by using the treasury stock method. The computations for basic and diluted EPS were as follows (in millions, except per-share data): Years ended December 31, 2020 2019 2018 Income (Numerator): Net income for basic and diluted EPS Shares (Denominator): Weighted-average shares for basic EPS Effect of dilutive securities Weighted-average shares for diluted EPS Basic EPS $ $ 7,264 $ 586 4 590 12.40 $ 7,842 $ 605 4 609 12.96 $ 8,394 661 4 665 12.70 Diluted EPS $ 12.31 $ 12.88 $ 12.62 For each of the three years ended December 31, 2020, the number of antidilutive employee stock-based awards excluded from the computation of diluted EPS was not significant.

Collaborations A collaborative arrangement is a contractual arrangement that involves a joint operating activity. Such arrangements involve two or more parties that are both (i) active participants in the activity and (ii) exposed to significant risks and rewards dependent on the commercial success of the activity. From time to time, we enter into collaborative arrangements for the R&D, manufacture and/or commercialization of products and/or product candidates. These collaborations generally provide for nonrefundable upfront license fees, development and commercial-performance milestone payments, cost sharing, royalty payments and/or profit sharing. Our collaboration arrangements are performed with no guarantee of either technological or commercial success, and each arrangement is unique in nature. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies, for additional discussion of revenues recognized for these types of arrangements. Operating expenses for costs incurred pursuant to these arrangements are reported in their respective expense line items in the Consolidated Statements of Income, net of any payments due to or reimbursements due from our collaboration partners, with such reimbursements being recognized at the time the party becomes obligated to pay. Our significant arrangements are discussed below. BeiGene, Ltd. On January 2, 2020, we acquired a 20.5% stake in BeiGene, Ltd. (BeiGene), for approximately $2.8 billion in cash as part of a collaboration to expand our oncology presence in China. Under the collaboration, BeiGene commenced selling XGEVA® and will commercialize KYPROLIS® and BLINCYTO® (blinatumomab) in China, and Amgen will share profits and losses equally during the initial product-specific commercialization periods; thereafter, product rights may revert to Amgen, and Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China of such products for a specified period. In addition, we will jointly develop a portion of our oncology portfolio with BeiGene sharing in global R&D costs by providing cash and development services up to $1.25 billion. Upon regulatory approval, BeiGene will assume commercialization rights in China for a specified period, and Amgen and BeiGene will share profits equally until certain of these product rights revert to Amgen. Upon return of the product rights, Amgen will pay royalties to BeiGene on sales in China for a specified period. For product sales outside of China, Amgen will also pay BeiGene royalties. During the year ended December 31, 2020, net costs recovered from BeiGene for oncology product candidates were $225 million and were recorded as an offset to R&D expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Profit share payments and product sales between Amgen and BeiGene were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020, the amount owed from BeiGene for net costs recovered was $113 million, which is included in Other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with this collaboration, we acquired an ownership interest in BeiGene. See Note 9, Investments. Novartis Pharma AG We are in a collaboration with Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) to jointly develop and commercialize Aimovig® (erenumab-aooe). In the United States, Amgen and Novartis jointly develop and collaborate on the commercialization of Aimovig®. Amgen, as the principal, recognizes product sales of Aimovig® in the United States, shares U.S. commercialization costs with Novartis and pays Novartis a significant royalty on net sales in the United States. Novartis holds global co-development rights and exclusive commercial rights outside the United States and Japan for Aimovig®. Novartis pays Amgen double-digit royalties on net sales of the product in the Novartis exclusive territories and funds a portion of global R&D expenses. In addition, Novartis will make a payment to Amgen of up to $100 million if certain commercial and expenditure thresholds are achieved with respect to Aimovig® in the United States. Amgen manufactures and supplies Aimovig® worldwide. The migraine collaboration will continue for the commercial life of the product unless terminated in accordance with its terms. We are currently involved in litigation with Novartis over our collaboration agreements for the development and commercialization of Aimovig®. See Note 19, Contingencies and commitments. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, net costs recovered from Novartis for migraine products were $192 million and $187 million, respectively, and were recorded primarily in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the year ended December 31, 2018, net costs paid to Novartis for migraine products were $44 million and were recorded primarily in SG&A expense in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, royalties due to Novartis for Aimovig® were $139 million, $115 million and $43 million, respectively, and were recorded in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, royalties due from Novartis for Aimovig® were not material. As a result of certain regulatory and commercial events, we received milestone payments from Novartis of $295 million during the year ended December 31, 2018, which was recorded in Other revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

Nexavar® is currently marketed and sold in more than 100 countries around the world for the treatment of unresectable liver cancer and advanced kidney cancer. In the United States, Nexavar® is also approved for the treatment of patients with locally recurrent or metastatic, progressive, differentiated thyroid carcinoma refractory to radioactive iodine treatment. In 2020, we amended the terms of our agreement with Bayer, which transferred all our operational responsibilities outside the United States to Bayer, including commercial and medical affairs activities. Prior to the amendment of the agreement, we shared equally in the profits outside the United States, excluding Japan. In lieu of this profit share, Bayer now pays us a royalty on sales of Nexavar® at a percentage rate in the low 30s. The rights to develop and market Nexavar® in Japan are reserved to Bayer. In the United States, Bayer pays us a royalty on sales of Nexavar® at a percentage rate in the high 30s. The agreement with Bayer will terminate at the later of the date when patents expire that were issued in connection with product candidates discovered under the agreement or on the last day that we or Bayer market or sell products commercialized under the agreement anywhere in the world. Patents related to Nexavar® began to expire in 2020. As a result of the 2020 amendment to the collaboration agreement, royalties due from Bayer for Nexavar® were $217 million and net profits were not material for the year ended December 31, 2020. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, royalties due from Bayer for Nexavar® were $79 million and $91 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, Amgen recorded Nexavar® net profits of $210 million and $164 million, respectively. Royalties and profit share due from Nexavar® were recorded in Other revenues in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Net R&D expenses related to the agreement were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Other In addition to the collaborations discussed above, we have various other collaborations that are not individually significant to our business at this time. Pursuant to the terms of those agreements, we may be required to pay additional amounts or we may receive additional amounts upon the achievement of various development and commercial milestones, which in the aggregate could be significant. We may also incur or have reimbursed to us significant R&D costs if the related product candidate were to advance to late-stage clinical trials. In addition, if any products related to these collaborations are approved for sale, we may be required to pay significant royalties or we may receive significant royalties on future sales. The payment of these amounts, however, is contingent upon the occurrence of various future events, which have a high degree of uncertainty of occurrence.

Realized gains and losses on interest-bearing securities are recorded in Interest and other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The cost of securities sold is based on the specific-identification method. The primary objective of our investment portfolio is to maintain safety of principal, prudent levels of liquidity and acceptable levels of risk. Our investment policy limits interest-bearing security investments to certain types of debt and money market instruments issued by institutions with investment-grade credit ratings, and it places restrictions on maturities and concentration by asset class and issuer. We review our available-for-sale investments for declines in fair value below our cost basis each quarter or whenever circumstances indicate that the cost basis of an asset may not be recoverable and assess whether the decline was due to credit-related factors or other factors. Our evaluation is based on a number of factors, including the extent to which the fair value is below our cost basis as well as adverse conditions related specifically to the security, such as any changes to the credit rating of the security and the intent to sell or whether we will more likely than not be required to sell the security before recovery of its amortized cost basis. Our assessment of whether a security is impaired could change in the future based on new developments or changes in assumptions related to that particular security. Equity securities We held investments in equity securities with readily determinable fair values of $477 million and $303 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, net unrealized gains on publicly traded securities were $174 million, $112 million and $24 million, respectively. Realized gains and losses on publicly traded securities for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were not material. We held investments of $203 million and $176 million in equity securities without readily determinable fair values as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Gains and losses recognized on these securities, including adjustments to the carrying values of these securities, were not material for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. Equity Method Investments Limited partnership investments We held limited partnership investments of $496 million and $320 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, which are included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. These investments, primarily investment funds of early-stage biotechnology companies, are accounted for by using the equity method of accounting and are measured by using our proportionate share of the net asset values of the underlying investments held by the limited partnerships as a practical expedient. These investments are typically redeemable only through distributions upon liquidation of the underlying assets. As of December 31, 2020, unfunded additional commitments to be made for these investments during the next several years were not material. For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 net gains recognized from our limited partnership investments were $241 million, $27 million and $91 million, respectively.

Our equity investment in BeiGene is included in Other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The fair value of equity securities acquired exceeded our proportionate share of the carrying value of the underlying net assets of BeiGene by approximately $2.4 billion. This investment is accounted for by using the equity method of accounting, which requires us to identify and allocate amounts to the items that give rise to the basis difference and to amortize these items over their useful lives. This amortization, along with our share of the results of operations of BeiGene, is included in Interest and other income, net, in our Consolidated Statements of Income. Recognition occurs one quarter in arrears, which began in the second quarter of 2020. The basis difference was allocated to finite-lived intangible assets, indefinite-lived intangible assets, equity-method goodwill and related deferred taxes. The finite-lived intangible assets are being amortized over a period ranging from 8 to 15 years. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized an increase in the carrying value of our investment by purchasing additional shares to maintain our ownership interest for an aggregate cost of $569 million and recognized $34 million for the impact of other BeiGene ownership transactions. The carrying value of the investment during the year ended December 31, 2020, was reduced for our share of BeiGene’s net losses of $229 million and amortization of the basis difference of $109 million. As of December 31, 2020, the carrying value and fair value of our approximately 20.5% ownership interest in BeiGene totaled $2.9 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively. We believe that as of December 31, 2020, the carrying value of our equity investment in BeiGene is fully recoverable.

All IPR&D projects have major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely and successful completion of the development and commercialization of product candidates, including our ability to confirm safety and efficacy based on data from clinical trials, our ability to obtain necessary regulatory approvals and our ability to successfully complete these tasks within budgeted costs. We are not permitted to market a human therapeutic without obtaining regulatory approvals, and such approvals require the completion of clinical trials that demonstrate that a product candidate is safe and effective. In addition, the availability and extent of coverage and reimbursement from third-party payers, including government healthcare programs and private insurance plans as well as competitive product launches, affect the revenues a product can generate. Consequently, the eventual realized values, if any, of acquired IPR&D projects may vary from their estimated fair values. We review IPR&D projects for impairment annually, whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable and upon the establishment of technological feasibility or regulatory approval. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized amortization associated with our finite-lived intangible assets of $2.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.3 billion, respectively. Amortization of intangible assets is included primarily in Cost of sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income. The total estimated amortization for our finite-lived intangible assets for the years ending December 31, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, are $2.6 billion, $2.5 billion, $2.4 billion, $2.4 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. 13. Leases On January 1, 2019, we adopted a new accounting standard that amends the guidance for the accounting and reporting of leases. Certain required disclosures have been made on a prospective basis in accordance with the standard’s guidance. See Note 1, Summary of significant accounting policies. We lease certain facilities and equipment related primarily to administrative, R&D and sales and marketing activities. Leases with terms of 12 months or less are expensed on a straight-line basis over the term and are not recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. Most leases include one or more options to renew, with renewal terms that may extend the lease term up to seven years. The exercise of lease renewal options is at our sole discretion. In addition, some of our lease agreements include rental payments adjusted periodically for inflation. Our lease agreements neither contain residual value guarantees nor impose significant restrictions or covenants. We sublease certain real estate to third parties. Our sublease portfolio consists of operating leases from former R&D and administrative space.

In addition, all of our outstanding notes—except our 0.41% 2023 Swiss franc Bonds and Other notes due 2097—may be redeemed at any time at our option—in whole or in part—at the principal amounts of the notes being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest and make-whole amounts, which are defined by the terms of the notes. Certain of the redeemable notes do not require the payment of make-whole amounts if redeemed during a specified period of time immediately prior to the maturity of the notes. Such time periods range from one month to six months prior to maturity. Debt issuances During the year ended December 31, 2020, we issued debt securities in the following offerings: • In February 2020, we issued $5.0 billion of debt consisting of $500 million of the 1.90% 2025 Notes, $750 million of the 2.20% 2027 Notes, $1.25 billion of the 2.45% 2030 Notes, $1.25 billion of the 3.15% 2040 Notes and $1.25 billion of the 3.375% 2050 Notes. • In May 2020, we issued $4.0 billion of debt consisting of $1.0 billion of the 2.20% 2027 Notes, $750 million of the 3.15% 2040 Notes and $1.0 billion of the 3.375% 2050 Notes, which represents a further issuance of, and which forms a single series with, each of the corresponding series of notes issued in February 2020, and $1.25 billion of the 2.30% 2031 Notes. We did not issue any debt or debt securities during the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018. Debt repayments/redemptions We made debt repayments/redemptions during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 as follows: • In 2020, we repaid/redeemed $6.5 billion of debt, including the repayment at maturity of the $300 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.50% 2020 Notes, the $750 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.125% 2020 Notes, the $300 million Floating Rate Notes due 2020 and the $700 million aggregate principal amount of the 2.20% 2020 Notes. In connection with the redemption of the $900 million aggregate principal amount of the 3.45% 2020 Notes, the $1.0 billion aggregate principal balance of the 4.10% 2021 Notes, the $750 million aggregate principal balance of the 1.85% 2021 Notes and the $1.75 billion aggregate principal balance of the 3.875% 2021 Notes, we paid a total of $96 million in make-whole amounts plus associated accrued and unpaid interest, all of which was recognized in Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. • In 2019, we repaid $4.5 billion of debt, including the $1.4 billion aggregate principal amount of the 2.20% 2019 Notes, the $1.0 billion aggregate principal amount of the 5.70% 2019 Notes, the €675 million aggregate principal amount ($864 million upon settlement of the related cross-currency swap) of the 2.125% 2019 euro Notes, the $700 million aggregate principal amount of the 1.90% 2019 Notes and the $550 million Floating Rate Notes due 2019. • In 2018, we repaid $1.1 billion of debt, including the $500 million aggregate principal amount of the 6.15% 2018 Notes and the €550 million aggregate principal amount of the 4.375% 2018 Notes revalued at $621 million upon maturity. Interest rate swaps To achieve a desired mix of fixed-rate and floating-rate debt, we entered into interest rate swap contracts that effectively converted fixed-rate interest coupons for certain of our debt issuances to floating LIBOR-based coupons over the lives of the respective notes. These interest rate swap contracts qualified and are designated as fair value hedges. In connection with the redemption of certain of the notes discussed above, associated interest rate swap contracts with an aggregate notional value of $3.65 billion were terminated. In addition, because of historically low interest rates, during the year ended December 31, 2020, we terminated interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $5.2 billion that hedged the 3.625% 2024 Notes, the 2.60% 2026 Notes, the 4.663% 2051 Notes and portions of the 3.625% 2022 Notes and the 3.125% 2025 Notes, which resulted in the receipt of $576 million of cash and reduced counterparty credit risk. Immediately following the terminations of these contracts, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements at then-current interest rates on the same $5.2 billion principal amount of notes.

Debt exchange In 2020, we completed a private offering to exchange portions of certain outstanding senior notes due 2037 through 2043 (collectively, Old Notes), listed below, for the $940 million principal amount of the newly issued 2.77% 2053 Notes (the Exchange Offer). The following principal amounts of each series of Old Notes were validly tendered and subsequently cancelled in connection with the Exchange Offer (in millions): Principal amountexchanged 6.375% 2037 Notes $ 74 6.90% 2038 Notes 37 6.40% 2039 Notes 133 5.75% 2040 Notes 39 5.15% 2041 Notes 245 5.65% 2042 Notes 72 5.375% 2043 Notes 76 The 2.77% 2053 Notes bear interest at a lower fixed coupon rate while requiring higher principal repayment at a later maturity date as compared to those of the Old Notes that were exchanged. There were no other significant changes to the terms between the Old Notes and the 2.77% 2053 Notes. In connection with the Exchange Offer, $85 million was paid to holders of the Old Notes (the cash consideration). The Exchange Offer was accounted for as a debt modification, and accordingly, deferred financing costs and discounts associated with the Old Notes, the cash consideration and the $264 million discount associated with the 2.77% 2053 Notes are being accreted over the term of these newly issued notes and recorded as Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income.

The terms of these contracts effectively convert the interest payments and principal repayments on our 1.25% 2022 euro Notes, 0.41% 2023 Swiss franc Bonds, 2.00% 2026 euro Notes, 5.50% 2026 pound sterling Notes and 4.00% 2029 pound sterling Notes from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. These cross-currency swap contracts have been designated as cash flow hedges. For information regarding the terms of these contracts, see Note 18, Derivative instruments. Shelf registration statement and other facilities As of December 31, 2020, we have a commercial paper program that allows us to issue up to $2.5 billion of unsecured commercial paper to fund our working-capital needs. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had no amounts outstanding under our commercial paper program. In 2019, we amended and restated our $2.5 billion syndicated, unsecured, revolving credit agreement, which is available for general corporate purposes or as a liquidity backstop to our commercial paper program. The commitments under the revolving credit agreement may be increased by up to $750 million with the agreement of the banks. Each bank that is a party to the agreement has an initial commitment term of five years. This term may be extended for up to two additional one-year periods with the agreement of the banks. Annual commitment fees for this agreement are 0.09% of the unused portion of the facility based on our current credit rating. Generally, we would be charged interest for any amounts borrowed under this facility, based on our current credit rating, at (i) LIBOR plus 1% or (ii) the highest of (A) the syndication agent bank base commercial lending rate, (B) the overnight federal funds rate plus 0.50% or (C) one-month LIBOR plus 1%. The agreement contains provisions relating to the determination of successor rates to address the possible phase-out or unavailability of designated reference rates. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no amounts were outstanding under this facility. In February 2020, we filed a shelf registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission that allows us to issue unspecified amounts of debt securities; common stock; preferred stock; warrants to purchase debt securities, common stock, preferred stock or depository shares; rights to purchase common stock or preferred stock; securities purchase contracts; securities purchase units; and depository shares. Under this shelf registration statement, all of the securities available for issuance may be offered from time to time with terms to be determined at the time of issuance. This shelf registration statement expires in February 2023. Certain of our financing arrangements contain nonfinancial covenants. In addition, our revolving credit agreement includes a financial covenant, which requires us to maintain a specified minimum interest coverage ratio of (i) the sum of consolidated net income, interest expense, provision for income taxes, depreciation expense, amortization expense, unusual or nonrecurring charges and other noncash items (Consolidated EBITDA) to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as defined and described in the credit agreement. We were in compliance with all applicable covenants under these arrangements as of December 31, 2020.

Interest costs capitalized for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were not material. Interest paid, including the ongoing impact of interest rate and cross-currency swap contracts, during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, were $1.2 billion, $1.3 billion and $1.5 billion, respectively.

Fair value measurement To estimate the fair value of our financial assets and liabilities, we use valuation approaches within a hierarchy that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that observable inputs be used when available. Observable inputs are inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the Company. Unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the Company’s assumptions about the inputs that market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability and are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances. The fair value hierarchy is divided into three levels based on the source of inputs as follows: Level 1 — Valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Companyhas the ability to access Level 2 — Valuations for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly—other than Level 1 inputs Level 3 — Valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement The availability of observable inputs can vary among the various types of financial assets and liabilities. To the extent that the valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market, the determination of fair value requires more judgment. In certain cases, the inputs used for measuring fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy. In such cases, for financial statement disclosure purposes, the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement is categorized is based on the lowest level of input used that is significant to the overall fair value measurement.

The inputs include reported trades of and broker-dealer quotes on the same or similar securities; issuer credit spreads; benchmark securities; and other observable inputs. We estimate the fair values of our residential-mortgage-backed securities by taking into consideration valuations obtained from third-party pricing services. The pricing services use industry-standard valuation models, including both income- and market-based approaches, for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly to estimate fair value. The inputs include reported trades of and broker-dealer quotes on the same or similar securities; issuer credit spreads; benchmark securities; prepayment or default projections based on historical data; and other observable inputs. We value our other short-term interest-bearing securities at amortized cost, which approximates fair value given their near-term maturity dates.

(Moody’s) or Fitch Ratings, Inc. (Fitch). We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, LIBOR, swap rates and obligor credit default swap rates. In addition, inputs for our foreign currency option contracts include implied volatility measures. These inputs, when applicable, are at commonly quoted intervals. See Note 18, Derivative instruments. Our cross-currency swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch. We estimate the fair values of these contracts by taking into consideration valuations obtained from a third-party valuation service that uses an income-based industry-standard valuation model for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly. These inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, LIBOR, swap rates, obligor credit default swap rates and cross-currency basis swap spreads. See Note 18, Derivative instruments. Our interest rate swap contracts are with counterparties that have minimum credit ratings of A– or equivalent by S&P, Moody’s or Fitch.

These inputs include LIBOR, swap rates and obligor credit default swap rates. See Note 18, Derivative instruments. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, there were no transfers of assets or liabilities between fair value measurement levels, and there were no material remeasurements to the fair values of assets and liabilities that are not measured at fair value on a recurring basis. During the year ended December 31, 2018, we discontinued the internal development of a program that resulted in an impairment of an IPR&D asset of $330 million, which was recognized in Other operating expenses in the Consolidated Statements of Income and included in Other items, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. Summary of the fair values of other financial instruments Cash equivalents The fair values of cash equivalents approximate their carrying values due to the short-term nature of such financial instruments. Borrowings We estimated the fair values of our borrowings by using Level 2 inputs. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, the aggregate fair values of our borrowings were $39.4 billion and $33.7 billion, respectively, and the carrying values were $33.0 billion and $29.9 billion, respectively. Investment in BeiGene We estimated the fair value of our investment in BeiGene by using Level 1 inputs. As of December 31, 2020, the fair value and carrying value were $4.9 billion and $2.9 billion, respectively. 18. Derivative instruments The Company is exposed to foreign currency exchange rate and interest rate risks related to its business operations. To reduce our risks related to such exposures, we use or have used certain derivative instruments, including foreign currency forward, foreign currency option, cross-currency swap, forward interest rate and interest rate swap contracts. We do not use derivatives for speculative trading purposes. Cash flow hedges We are exposed to possible changes in the values of certain anticipated foreign currency cash flows resulting from changes in foreign currency exchange rates associated primarily with our euro-denominated international product sales. Increases and decreases in the cash flows associated with our international product sales due to movements in foreign currency exchange rates are partially offset by corresponding increases and decreases in the cash flows from our international operating expenses resulting from these foreign currency exchange rate movements. To further reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations with regard to our international product sales, we enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge a portion of our projected international product sales primarily over a three-year time horizon, with, at any given point in time, a higher percentage of nearer-term projected product sales being hedged than in successive periods.

As of December 31, 2018 we had outstanding foreign currency option contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $21 million, and no such outstanding contracts as of December 31, 2020 and 2019. We have designated these foreign currency forward and foreign currency option contracts, which are primarily euro based, as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, we report the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and we reclassify them to Product sales in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same periods during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. To hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with certain of our long-term debt denominated in foreign currencies, we enter into cross-currency swap contracts. Under the terms of such contracts, we paid euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs and received U.S. dollars for the notional amounts at the inception of the contracts; and based on these notional amounts, we exchange interest payments at fixed rates over the lives of the contracts by paying U.S. dollars and receiving euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs. In addition, we will pay U.S. dollars to and receive euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs from the counterparties at the maturities of the contracts for these same notional amounts. The terms of these contracts correspond to the related hedged debt, thereby effectively converting the interest payments and principal repayment on the debt from euros, pounds sterling and Swiss francs to U.S. dollars. We have designated these cross-currency swap contracts as cash flow hedges. Accordingly, the unrealized gains and losses on these contracts are reported in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and reclassified to Interest and other income, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income in the same periods during which the hedged debt affects earnings. The notional amounts and interest rates of our cross-currency swaps as of December 31, 2020, were as follows (notional amounts in millions): Foreign currency U.S. dollars Hedged notes Notional amounts Interest rates Notional amounts Interest rates 1.25% 2022 euro Notes € 1,250 1.3 % $ 1,388 3.2 % 0.41% 2023 Swiss franc Bonds CHF 700 0.4 % $ 704 3.4 % 2.00% 2026 euro Notes € 750 2.0 % $ 833 3.9 % 5.50% 2026 pound sterling Notes £ 475 5.5 % $ 747 6.0 % 4.00% 2029 pound sterling Notes £ 700 4.0 % $ 1,111 4.5 % During the year ended December 31, 2019, our 2.125% 2019 euro Notes matured, and the related cross-currency swaps were settled. In connection with the anticipated issuance of long-term fixed-rate debt, we occasionally enter into forward interest rate contracts in order to hedge the variability in cash flows due to changes in the applicable U.S. Treasury rate between the time we enter into these contracts and the time the related debt is issued. Gains and losses on forward interest rate contracts, which are designated as cash flow hedges, are recognized in AOCI in the Consolidated Balance Sheets and are amortized into Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the lives of the associated debt issuances. Amounts recognized in connection with forward interest rate swaps during the year ended December 31, 2020, and amounts expected to be recognized during the subsequent 12 months are not material.

These interest rate swap contracts effectively convert fixed-rate coupons to floating-rate LIBOR-based coupons over the terms of the related hedge contracts. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had interest rate swap contracts with aggregate notional amounts of $5.9 billion and $9.6 billion, respectively, that hedge certain portions of our long-term debt issuances. Interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional value of $3.7 billion were terminated during the year ended December 31, 2020, in connection with the redemption of certain of our notes. The terminations of these interest rate swaps resulted in a gain of $40 million, recognized in Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income. Additionally, we terminated $5.2 billion aggregate notional amount of interest rate swaps, which resulted in the receipt of $576 million from the counterparties that was included in Net cash provided by operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the year ended December 31, 2020. This amount will be recognized as a reduction in Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income over the remaining life of the underlying notes. Immediately following the terminations of these interest rate swap contracts, we entered into new interest rate swap agreements at then-current interest rates on the same $5.2 billion principal amount of notes. See Note 15, Financing arrangements, for information on our interest rate swaps. For interest rate swap contracts that qualify for and are designated as fair value hedges, we recognize in Interest expense, net, in the Consolidated Statements of Income the unrealized gain or loss on the derivative resulting from the change in fair value during the period, as well as the offsetting unrealized loss or gain of the hedged item resulting from the change in fair value during the period attributable to the hedged risk. If a hedging relationship involving an interest rate swap contract is terminated, the gain or loss realized on contract termination is recorded as an adjustment to the carrying value of the debt and amortized into Interest expense, net, over the remaining life of the previously hedged debt. The hedged liabilities and related cumulative-basis adjustments for fair value hedges of those liabilities were recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets as follows (in millions): Cumulative amounts of fair value Carrying amounts ofhedged liabilities(1) hedging adjustments related to thecarrying amounts of the hedgedliabilities(2) December 31, December 31, Consolidated Balance Sheets locations 2020 2019 2020 2019 Current portion of long-term debt $ 89 $ 903 $ 89 $ 4 Long-term debt $ 6,258 $ 8,814 $ 477 $ 292 (1) Current portion of long-term debt includes $89 million of carrying value with discontinued hedging relationships as of December 31, 2020.

As of December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, the total notional amounts of these foreign currency forward contracts were $1.0 billion, $1.2 billion and $737 million, respectively.

If these events were to occur, the counterparties would have the right but not the obligation to close the contracts under early-termination provisions. In such circumstances, the counterparties could request immediate settlement of these contracts for amounts that approximate the then current fair values of the contracts. In addition, our derivative contracts are not subject to any type of master netting arrangement, and amounts due either to or from a counterparty under the contracts may be offset against other amounts due either to or from the same counterparty only if an event of default or termination, as defined, were to occur. The cash flow effects of our derivative contracts in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows are included in Net cash provided by operating activities, except for the settlement of notional amounts of cross-currency swaps, which are included in Net cash used in financing activities. 19. Contingencies and commitments Contingencies In the ordinary course of business, we are involved in various legal proceedings, government investigations and other matters that are complex in nature and have outcomes that are difficult to predict. See Part I, Item 1A. Risk Factors—Our business may be affected by litigation and government investigations. We describe our legal proceedings and other matters that are significant or that we believe could become significant in this footnote. We record accruals for loss contingencies to the extent that we conclude it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the related loss can be reasonably estimated. We evaluate, on a quarterly basis, developments in legal proceedings and other matters that could cause an increase or decrease in the amount of the liability that has been accrued previously. Our legal proceedings involve various aspects of our business and a variety of claims, some of which present novel factual allegations and/or unique legal theories. In each of the matters described in this filing, in which we could incur a liability, our opponents seek an award of a not-yet-quantified amount of damages or an amount that is not material. In addition, a number of the matters pending against us are at very early stages of the legal process, which in complex proceedings of the sort we face often extend for several years. As a result, none of the matters described in this filing, in which we could incur a liability, have progressed sufficiently through discovery and/or the development of important factual information and legal issues to enable us to estimate a range of possible loss, if any, or such amounts are not material. While it is not possible to accurately predict or determine the eventual outcomes of these matters, an adverse determination in one or more of these matters currently pending could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

Cipla Limited, et al. Between October 2016 and April 2018, Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. (Onyx Therapeutics, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Amgen), filed separate lawsuits in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware (the Delaware District Court) against: (1) Cipla Limited and Cipla USA, Inc. (collectively, Cipla); (2) Sagent Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Sagent); (3) Breckenridge Pharmaceutical, Inc. (Breckenridge); and (4) Fresenius Kabi, USA LLC, Fresenius Kabi USA, Inc., Fresenius Kabi Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. and Fresenius Kabi Oncology Limited; (5) Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.; (6) MSN Laboratories Private Limited and MSN Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (collectively, MSN); (7) Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Ltd. and Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Inc. (collectively, DRL); (8) Qilu Pharma, Inc. and Qilu Pharmaceutical Co. Ltd. (collectively, Qilu); (9) Apotex Inc. and Apotex Corp. (Apotex); (10) InnoPharma, Inc. (InnoPharma); and (11) Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., each for infringement of one or more of our following patents, which are listed in the Approved Drug Products with Therapeutic Equivalence Evaluations (the Orange Book) for KYPROLIS®: U.S. Patent Nos. 7,232,818 (the ’818 Patent), 7,417,042 (the ’042 Patent), 7,491,704 (the ’704 Patent), 7,737,112 (the ’112 Patent), 8,129,346 (the ’346 Patent), 8,207,125 (the ’125 Patent), 8,207,126 (the ’126 Patent), 8,207,127 (the ’127 Patent) and 8,207,297 (the ’297 Patent). Each of these lawsuits was based on each defendant’s submission of an ANDA seeking U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval to market a generic version of KYPROLIS®. In each lawsuit, Onyx Therapeutics sought an order of the Delaware District Court making any FDA approval of the respective defendant’s ANDA effective no earlier than the expiration of the applicable patents. The Delaware District Court consolidated these lawsuits for purposes of discovery into a single case, Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. Cipla Limited, et al. In January 2017, by stipulation with Onyx Therapeutics, Fresenius Kabi Pharmaceuticals Holding, Inc. and Fresenius Kabi Oncology Limited were dismissed from the lawsuit, leaving Fresenius Kabi, USA LLC and Fresenius Kabi USA, Inc. (collectively, Fresenius) as the remaining Fresenius defendants. In September 2017 and February 2018, respectively, by joint stipulation with Onyx Therapeutics, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. and Teva Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. were each dismissed from the lawsuit, and in February 2018, Qilu was dismissed from the lawsuit by joint stipulation between Onyx Therapeutics and Qilu. Between April and July of 2018, the Delaware District Court entered orders on stipulations between Onyx Therapeutics and each of Apotex, DRL, Sagent, Fresenius, Breckenridge, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., Cipla and InnoPharma, respectively, that each defendant infringes the ’042, ’112, ’125, ’126 and ’127 Patents. Onyx Therapeutics provided those defendants, either through a stipulated order or other agreement, a covenant that it would not assert patent infringement of the ’818,’704,’346 and ’297 Patents against certain of the respective defendants’ ANDA applications and products. In June 2018, the Delaware District Court entered an order on a stipulation between Onyx Therapeutics and MSN that MSN infringes the ’112 Patent. In December 2018, Apotex, DRL, Fresenius, InnoPharma, Sagent, Breckenridge, Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc. and Cipla amended their responses to the complaints to add the defense of unclean hands and to seek declarations of unenforceability of the asserted patents based on allegations of inequitable conduct. In January 2019, MSN amended its responses to the complaints to add the defense of unclean hands. On January 11, 2019, Onyx Therapeutics filed a separate lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Breckenridge for infringement of the ’042, ’112 and ’125 Patents in connection with its ANDA that seeks approval to market generic versions of KYPROLIS®. On March 4, 2019, the Delaware District Court entered an order on a stipulation between Onyx Therapeutics and Breckenridge, providing that Breckenridge infringes the asserted claims of the ’042, ’112 and ’125 Patents, and consolidated this lawsuit against Breckenridge into the existing consolidated case, Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. Cipla Limited, et al., for all purposes. On May 6, 2019, the Delaware District Court commenced trial in the Onyx Therapeutics, Inc. v. Cipla Limited, et al. consolidated case. During trial, the Delaware District Court signed consent judgments filed by Onyx Therapeutics and each of Aurobindo Pharma USA, Inc., InnoPharma, Sagent, Apotex, Fresenius, DRL and Breckenridge, in which the parties stipulated to entry of: (1) judgment dismissing with prejudice all of the parties’ claims, counterclaims, affirmative defenses and demands; and (2) an injunction prohibiting infringement of the ’042, ’112 and ’125 Patents by the manufacture, use, sale, offer to sell or importation into the United States of the applicable defendant’s carfilzomib product unless specifically authorized pursuant to the applicable confidential settlement agreement.

In February 2017, the Delaware District Court consolidated these 14 lawsuits into a single case, Amgen Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al. In June 2017, Amgen filed an additional lawsuit in the Delaware District Court for infringement of the ’405 Patent which was consolidated into Amgen Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al. in August 2017. The ’405 Patent is entitled “Rapid Dissolution Formulation of a Calcium Receptor-Active Compound” and expires in 2026. All defendants responding to the complaint denied infringement and sought judgment that the ’405 Patent is invalid and/or not infringed. Between September and November of 2017, Amgen filed, and the Delaware District Court signed, stipulated dismissals of the lawsuit against Micro Labs Ltd. and Micro Labs USA, Inc., and the lawsuit against Apotex, as well as consent judgments filed by Amgen and each of (1) Sun Pharma Global FZE, Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Ltd. and Sun Pharmaceutical Industries, Inc.

Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al. consolidated lawsuit against the defendants that remained in the lawsuit, collectively consisting of (1) Watson Laboratories, Inc. and Actavis Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Watson); (2) Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC and Amneal Pharmaceuticals of New York, LLC (collectively, Amneal); (3) Zydus Pharmaceuticals (USA) Inc. and Cadila Healthcare Ltd. (collectively, Zydus); and (4) Piramal Healthcare UK Limited (Piramal). Just prior to trial, the Delaware District Court signed consent judgments filed by Amgen and each of Cipla, and Strides Pharma Global Pte Limited and Strides Pharma, Inc. (collectively, Strides), and a consent judgment filed by Amgen and Aurobindo. In each consent judgment, the parties stipulated to an entry of judgment of infringement and validity of the ’405 Patent and an injunction prohibiting the manufacture, use, sale, offer to sell, importation of or distribution into the United States of the applicable defendant’s cinacalcet product during the term of the ’405 Patent, unless specifically authorized pursuant to the applicable confidential settlement agreement. Just prior to trial, the Delaware District Court also entered orders dismissing each of DRL and Mylan Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Mylan Inc. (collectively, Mylan), on stipulations between Amgen and such parties, respectively, subject to the terms of confidential settlement agreements. In July 2018, the Delaware District Court issued a trial order finding on the infringement claims and defenses in the Amgen Inc. v. Aurobindo Pharma Ltd. et al. consolidated lawsuit that Zydus infringes the ’405 Patent and that Amneal, Piramal and Watson do not infringe the ’405 Patent. In August 2018, the Delaware District Court issued an order dismissing, without prejudice, the invalidity counterclaims of Amneal, Piramal and Watson and entered judgment of noninfringement of the ’405 Patent in favor of Amneal, Piramal and Watson. In September 2018, Amgen filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit Court. In October 2018, the Delaware District Court dismissed, without prejudice, the invalidity counterclaims of Zydus and entered judgment of infringement of the ’405 Patent by Zydus in favor of Amgen, including an order that the effective date of the FDA approval of Zydus’ generic version of Sensipar® shall be no earlier than the expiry date of our ’405 Patent. Also in October 2018, Zydus filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit Court, and the Federal Circuit Court consolidated the appeals of Zydus and Amgen. In December 2018, the FDA approved Watson’s generic version of Sensipar® and Watson’s parent company, Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (Teva), began selling its product at-risk notwithstanding that the appeals were pending at the Federal Circuit Court. On January 2, 2019, Amgen, Watson and Teva entered into a settlement agreement in which Teva agreed to stop selling its generic product until the mid-year 2021 (or earlier under certain circumstances) and to pay Amgen an undisclosed amount. On January 9, 2019, Watson and Amgen filed a motion asking the Delaware District Court to vacate its final judgment of noninfringement as to Watson and to enter a proposed consent judgment of infringement and validity of the ’405 Patent and an injunction prohibiting the making, having made, using, selling, offering to sell, or distributing Watson’s cinacalcet product in the United States or importing Watson’s cinacalcet product into the United States, consistent with the confidential settlement agreement. On January 11, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court stayed the pending appeal by Amgen of the judgment of noninfringement as to Watson in order for the Delaware District Court to rule on the motion of Watson and Amgen. On March 26, 2019, the Delaware District Court denied the joint motion for indicative ruling of Watson and Amgen. On April 10, 2019, Amgen filed an appeal to the Federal Circuit Court and the Federal Circuit Court lifted the stay of Amgen’s appeal of the judgment of noninfringement as to Watson and consolidated it with Amgen’s appeal of the Delaware District Court’s denial of the joint motion for indicative ruling. On September 13, 2019, the Federal Circuit Court denied Amgen’s motion and lifted the stay of the briefing schedule which had been stayed pending disposition of Amgen’s motion to vacate. On July 9, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court granted a motion filed by Amgen and Watson to dismiss Amgen’s appeals of the Delaware District Court’s judgment of noninfringement as to Watson and denial of the joint motion for indicative ruling. On March 19, 2019, Amgen filed an emergency motion for an injunction pending appeal, seeking an order from the Delaware District Court enjoining defendant Piramal from making, using, selling, offering for sale or importing its generic cinacalcet product. Amgen’s motion follows an announcement that Slate Run Pharmaceuticals LLC (Slate Run), in partnership with Piramal, had begun selling Piramal’s generic cinacalcet product at-risk notwithstanding the appeals pending at the Federal Circuit Court. On April 15, 2019, the Delaware District Court signed an order enjoining Piramal and Slate Run from selling their generic cinacalcet product until certain events occur related to a decision by the Federal Circuit Court on the parties’ appeal. The order has no effect on the product that Piramal and Slate Run had already sold to third parties. On January 7, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court issued an opinion affirming the judgment of noninfringement with respect to Piramal, affirming the judgment of infringement with respect to Zydus and vacating and remanding to the Delaware District Court for further consideration the judgment of noninfringement with respect to Amneal. On April 22, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court issued a mandate returning the case to the Delaware District Court. On September 8, 2020, the Delaware District Court entered judgment of validity and infringement of the ’405 Patent in the lawsuit filed against Amneal and, except to the extent specifically authorized in a confidential settlement agreement, enjoined Amneal from infringing the ’405 Patent by making, using, selling, offering to sell or importing Amneal’s cinacalcet product during the term of the patent.

On October 14, 2020, the Delaware District Court issued an order permitting Slate Run, Piramal’s business partner, to intervene in the pending action. ENBREL Patent Litigation Immunex Corporation, et al. v. Sandoz Inc., et al. In February 2016, two affiliates of Amgen Inc., Immunex Corporation and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (collectively, Amgen), along with Hoffmann-La Roche Inc. (Roche), filed a lawsuit in the New Jersey District Court against Sandoz Inc., Sandoz International GmbH and Sandoz GmbH (collectively, Sandoz). This lawsuit stems from Sandoz’s submission of an application for FDA licensure of an etanercept product as biosimilar to Amgen’s ENBREL. Amgen and Roche have asserted infringement of five patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,063,182 (the ’182 Patent), 8,163,522 (the ’522 Patent), 7,915,225 (the ’225 Patent), 8,119,605 (the ’605 Patent) and 8,722,631 (the ’631 Patent). By their complaint, Amgen and Roche seek an injunction to prohibit Sandoz from commercializing its biosimilar etanercept product in the United States prior to the expiry of such patents. All Sandoz defendants responded by denying infringement and/or asserting that the patents at issue are invalid. In August 2016, and subject to the terms of a confidential stipulation, the New Jersey District Court entered a preliminary injunction prohibiting Sandoz from making, using, importing, selling or offering for sale Sandoz’s etanercept product. Sandoz’s ErelziTM, a biosimilar to ENBREL, was approved by the FDA in August 2016. In September 2018, the New Jersey District Court entered an order that the making, using, offering to sell or selling in the United States or the importation into the United States by Sandoz of Sandoz’s biosimilar etanercept product infringes the ’182 and ’522 Patents and held a bench trial, focusing on Sandoz’s challenges to the validity of these patents. On August 9, 2019, the New Jersey District Court issued its decision upholding the validity of the ’182 and ’522 Patents. On October 8, 2019, by stipulation of Amgen and Sandoz, the New Jersey District Court entered final judgment and a permanent injunction prohibiting Sandoz from making, using, importing, selling or offering for sale Sandoz’s etanercept product, and, on the same day, Sandoz appealed the final judgment to the Federal Circuit Court. Following a motion by Sandoz, the Federal Circuit Court ordered an expedited briefing schedule for the appeal. On March 4, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument on the appeal. On July 1, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court affirmed the judgment of the New Jersey District Court upholding the validity of the ’182 and ’522 Patents. On September 29, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court denied the petition for rehearing of Sandoz filed on July 31, 2020. On January 29, 2021, Sandoz filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Federal Circuit Court’s affirmance of the validity of the ’182 and ’522 Patents. Immunex Corporation, et al. v. Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. On April 30, 2019, two affiliates of Amgen Inc., Immunex Corporation and Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (collectively, Amgen), along with Roche, filed a lawsuit in the New Jersey District Court against Samsung Bioepis Co., Ltd. (Bioepis). This lawsuit stems from Bioepis’ submission of an application for FDA licensure of an etanercept product as biosimilar to Amgen’s ENBREL. Amgen and Roche have asserted infringement of five patents: the ’182, ’522, ’225, ’605 and ’631 Patents. By their complaint, Amgen and Roche seek an injunction to prohibit Bioepis from commercializing its biosimilar etanercept product in the United States prior to the expiry of such patents. On August 5, 2019, Bioepis responded to the complaint, denying infringement and seeking judgment that the patents-in-suit are invalid, unenforceable and/or not infringed. On January 9, 2020 and subject to the terms of a confidential stipulation and court order of January 6, 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered a consent injunction that prohibits Bioepis from making, using, offering to sell, selling or importing into the United States Bioepis’ etanercept product. Amgen and Bioepis entered into an agreement with respect to an injunction regarding etanercept as set out in the New Jersey District Court’s order of January 6, 2020. On January 15, 2020, the New Jersey District Court entered an order administratively staying the case pursuant to a joint request of Amgen and Bioepis.

In October 2014, Amgen initiated a series of lawsuits that were consolidated by the Delaware District Court in December 2014 into a single case against Sanofi, Sanofi-Aventis U.S. LLC and Aventisub LLC, formerly doing business as Aventis Pharmaceuticals Inc. (collectively, Sanofi) and Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Regeneron), addressing seven of our patents: U.S. Patent Nos. 8,563,698; 8,829,165 (the ’165 Patent); 8,859,741 (the ’741 Patent); 8,871,913; 8,871,914; 8,883,983; and 8,889,834. These patents describe and claim monoclonal antibodies to proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). By its complaints, Amgen seeks an injunction to prevent the infringing manufacture, use and sale of Sanofi and Regeneron’s alirocumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting PCSK9. In January 2016, the Delaware District Court granted Amgen’s motion to amend the complaint to add its affiliates, Amgen Manufacturing, Limited and Amgen USA Inc., as plaintiffs and to add the allegation that Sanofi and Regeneron’s infringement of Amgen’s patents is willful. In February 2016, the Delaware District Court entered a stipulated order finding alirocumab and the drug product containing it, PRALUENT® infringe certain of Amgen’s patents, including claims 2, 7, 9, 15, 19 and 29 of the ’165 Patent and claim 7 of the ’741 Patent. In March 2016, the Delaware District Court entered judgment in favor of Amgen following a five-day jury trial and a unanimous jury verdict that these patent claims are all valid. In January 2017, the Delaware District Court denied Sanofi and Regeneron’s post-trial motions seeking a new trial and for judgment as a matter of law, and granted Amgen’s motion for a permanent injunction prohibiting the infringing manufacture, use, sale, offer for sale or import of alirocumab in the United States. Sanofi and Regeneron filed an appeal of the judgment and the permanent injunction to the Federal Circuit Court. In February 2017, following a motion by Sanofi and Regeneron, the Federal Circuit Court entered a stay of the permanent injunction during the pendency of the appeal. In October 2017, the Federal Circuit Court reversed in part the judgment of the Delaware District Court and remanded for a new trial two of the patent validity defenses (lack of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions), and affirmed the Delaware District Court’s judgment of infringement of claims 2, 7, 9, 15, 19 and 29 of the ’165 Patent and claim 7 of the ’741 Patent and the third patent validity defense (finding that the claimed inventions were not obvious to a person of ordinary skill in the field of the patents). In March 2018, the Federal Circuit Court issued a mandate returning the case to the Delaware District Court for a new trial on two of Sanofi and Regeneron’s challenges to the validity of our patents (lack of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions) and for further consideration of a permanent injunction. In July 2018, Amgen filed a petition for certiorari with the U.S. Supreme Court seeking review of the Federal Circuit Court’s conclusion that the judgment affirming the validity of Amgen’s patents was based, in part, on an erroneous application of the law of written description. On January 7, 2019, the U.S. Supreme Court denied Amgen’s petition for certiorari. On remand, the Delaware District Court scheduled a new trial on Sanofi and Regeneron’s challenges to the validity of our patents based on lack of written description and enablement of the claimed inventions. The Delaware District Court also entered judgment on the pleadings for Sanofi and Regeneron on Amgen’s claim of willful infringement. On February 25, 2019, a jury of the Delaware District Court unanimously upheld the validity of claims 19 and 29 of the ’165 Patent and claim 7 of the ’741 Patent. The jury also found that claims 7 and 15 of the ’165 Patent meet the enablement requirement, but are invalid for failure to meet the written description requirement. On March 18, 2019, Sanofi and Regeneron filed post-trial motions seeking to reverse judgment as a matter of law or for a new trial with respect to claims 19 and 29 of the ’165 Patent and claim 7 of the ’741 Patent, and Amgen filed a motion for a permanent injunction. On June 6, 13 and 21, 2019, the Delaware District Court held evidentiary hearings on Amgen’s motion for a permanent injunction against PRALUENT®. On August 28, 2019, the Delaware District Court ruled on the post-trial motions, denying Sanofi and Regeneron’s request for a new trial and their request to reverse the jury verdict that the ’165 Patent and the ’741 Patent provide written description support for the claimed inventions. The Delaware District Court also ruled as a matter of law that claims 19 and 29 of the ’165 Patent and claim 7 of the ’741 Patent are invalid for failing to meet the enablement requirement, overturning the jury verdict. On October 23, 2019, Amgen filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit Court. On December 9, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court heard oral argument on the appeal. Patent Disputes in the International Region We are involved in and expect future involvement in additional disputes regarding our PCSK9 patents in other jurisdictions and regions. This includes matters filed against us and that we have filed in the United Kingdom, Germany, France, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain and Japan.

This patent describes and claims monoclonal antibodies to PCSK9 and methods of treatment and Sanofi filed an opposition to the patent in the EPO seeking to invalidate it. In November 2016, Sanofi-Aventis Deutschland GmbH, Sanofi-Aventis Groupe S.A. and Sanofi Winthrop Industrie S.A. filed a joint opposition against Amgen’s patent, and each of Eli Lilly and Company, Regeneron and Strawman Ltd. also filed oppositions to Amgen’s patent. In November 2018, the EPO confirmed the validity of Amgen’s EP 2,215,124, which was appealed to the Technical Board of Appeal (TBA). On October 29, 2020, the TBA upheld the validity of certain claims, including claims that protect Repatha®, but ruled that broader claims encompassing PRALUENT® were invalid. As a result of the TBA’s decision, national litigations regarding PRALUENT® in Europe are in the process of being resolved. On April 24, 2020, the Supreme Court of Japan declined to hear Sanofi K.K.’s appeals making final the Japanese High Court’s decisions that PRALUENT® infringes Amgen’s valid patent rights in Japan. On June 24, 2020, Amgen filed written answers to the invalidity trials initiated by Regeneron on February 12, 2020 before the Japan Patent Office seeking to invalidate Amgen’s Japanese patents that were previously held infringed by PRALUENT® and valid over challenges filed by Sanofi K.K. Damages proceedings against Sanofi K.K. are ongoing before the Tokyo District Court, where Sanofi K.K. has initiated new validity challenges to Amgen patents in Japan. NEUPOGEN® (filgrastim)/Neulasta® Patent Litigation Amgen Inc., et al. v. Pfizer Inc. et al. In July 2018, Amgen Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (collectively, Amgen), filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Pfizer Inc. and Hospira Inc. (collectively, Pfizer). This lawsuit stems from Pfizer’s submission of an application for FDA licensure of a filgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s NEUPOGEN®. Amgen has asserted infringement of U.S. Patent No. 9,643,997 (the ’997 Patent) and seeks, among other remedies, injunctive relief to prohibit Pfizer from infringing the ’997 Patent. In July 2018, the FDA approved Pfizer’s NIVESTYMTM, a biosimilar to NEUPOGEN®, which was subsequently launched in October 2018. In August 2018, Pfizer answered the complaint and counterclaimed seeking a declaration that Pfizer does not infringe Amgen’s ’997 Patent and that the patent is invalid. On March 22, 2019, Amgen filed an amended complaint against Pfizer in the Delaware District Court narrowing the patent claims at issue in the infringement dispute and adding a request for damages. On April 11, 2019, Pfizer answered Amgen’s amended complaint including counterclaims seeking declaratory judgments of noninfringement and invalidity. On February 18, 2020, the Delaware District Court entered an amended scheduling order moving the trial on the infringement of our ’997 Patent to May 17, 2021, to enable Amgen to seek additional discovery into Pfizer’s invalidity defenses. On April 24, 2020, Amgen filed a separate lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Pfizer for infringement of U.S. Patent No. 10,577,392 (the ’392 Patent) and seeks, among other remedies, damages and injunctive relief to prohibit Pfizer from infringing the ’392 Patent by the manufacture, import and sale of Pfizer’s NIVESTYMTM. On January 7, 2021, the Delaware District Court granted Pfizer’s request to stay the patent infringement lawsuit on the ’392 Patent until the co-pending patent infringement lawsuit on the ’997 Patent is resolved. Amgen Inc., et al. v. Hospira Inc. et al. On February 11, 2020, Amgen Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiary, Amgen Manufacturing, Limited (collectively, Amgen), filed a lawsuit in the Delaware District Court against Pfizer. This lawsuit stems from Pfizer’s submission of an application for FDA licensure of a pegfilgrastim product as biosimilar to Amgen’s Neulasta®. Amgen has asserted infringement of U.S. Patent No. 8,273,707 (the ’707 Patent) and seeks, among other remedies, injunctive relief to prohibit Pfizer from infringing the ’707 Patent. On March 4, 2020, Pfizer filed a motion requesting the Delaware District Court to dismiss the complaint by Amgen alleging noninfringement of the ’707 Patent. In June 2020, the FDA approved Pfizer’s NYVEPRIA™, a biosimilar to Amgen’s Neulasta®. Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) Challenge Lupin PTAB Challenge On December 15, 2020, Lupin Limited (Lupin) filed a petition to institute inter parties review (IPR) proceeding at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) of U.S. Patent No. 9,856,287 (the ’287 Patent) challenging claims of the ’287 Patent as unpatentable. Amgen’ s preliminary response is due on April 14, 2021 and the PTAB will then have no more than three months to decide whether to institute a proceeding.

In May 2017, Amgen filed its response. In February 2018, the PTAB issued a final decision holding all but one claim of the ’138 Patent as unpatentable and Apotex filed a request for rehearing in March 2018. On May 20, 2019, the PTAB issued a decision denying Apotex’s request for rehearing on the PTAB’s finding and sua sponte amending the final decision with a finding that the one remaining claim in Amgen’s ’138 Patent is unpatentable. On July 22, 2019, Amgen filed a notice of appeal to the Federal Circuit Court with respect to all claims held to be unpatentable. On August 5, 2019, Apotex provided notice that it would not participate in the appeal. On September 16, 2019, the USPTO filed a notice of intervention on the appeal. On March 24, 2020, the Federal Circuit Court vacated the decision by the PTAB and remanded the case to the PTAB for proceeding consistent with the Federal Circuit Court’s decision in Arthrex Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 941 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2019). On July 14, 2020, Amgen and Apotex filed a joint motion to terminate the IPR proceedings stating that there is no current dispute between the parties with respect to the ’138 Patent. On July 29, 2020, the U.S. government filed a petition for writ of certiorari with respect to the cases that the Federal Circuit Court remanded to the PTAB, including the case regarding the ’138 Patent, for proceedings consistent with its decision in Arthrex Inc. v. Smith & Nephew, Inc., 941 F.3d 1320 (Fed. Cir. 2019), requesting that such remanded cases be held pending the U.S. Supreme Court’s disposition of the petition for writ of certiorari in United States v. Arthrex, Inc., No. 19-1434. On August 25, 2020, Amgen filed its response to the U.S. government’s petition for writ of certiorari indicating that Amgen did not intend to respond unless requested by the U.S. Supreme Court. Breach of Contract Action Novartis Pharma AG v. Amgen Inc. On April 4, 2019, Amgen filed a lawsuit in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York (the New York Southern District Court) against Novartis Pharma AG (Novartis) seeking a declaratory judgment that Novartis materially breached two collaboration agreements Amgen and Novartis entered into in 2015 and 2017 (the 2015 Agreement and the 2017 Agreement, respectively) related to the development and commercialization of Aimovig® due to Novartis’ affiliate Sandoz GmbH entering into a contract manufacturing agreement with Alder BioPharmaceuticals, Inc. (Alder) related to eptinezumab, an expected direct competitor to Aimovig® and entrant in the calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP)-related migraine therapy market. Amgen seeks to terminate its collaboration agreements with Novartis and also seeks damages from Novartis for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. Also on April 4, 2019, Novartis initiated a separate lawsuit against Amgen in the same court seeking declaratory judgment that Novartis, alternatively, did not materially breach the collaboration agreements or, even if it did breach the collaboration agreements, such breach was not material and has been cured, and that Amgen may not terminate the collaboration agreements. On April 8, 2019, Amgen answered Novartis’ complaint and filed counterclaims seeking a declaratory judgment that Novartis materially breached the collaboration agreements due to its affiliate Sandoz GmbH entering into the contract manufacturing agreement with Alder. In its counterclaim, Amgen seeks to terminate its collaboration agreements with Novartis and also seeks damages from Novartis for breach of contract and negligent misrepresentation. On July 16, 2019, Novartis filed an amended complaint adding a claim for breach of contract alleging Novartis is owed amounts associated with 2018 budget overruns and Amgen responded with a counterclaim alleging additional breaches by Novartis of the collaboration agreements. On September 17, 2019 and October 8, 2019, Novartis and Amgen, respectively, each filed its motion for judgment on the pleadings. On February 3, 2020, Amgen was granted leave to file its amended counterclaims. On February 4, 2020, Amgen filed its amended answer to Novartis’ first amended complaint and second amended counterclaims for affirmative relief to add a fraudulent inducement claim. On February 18, 2020, Novartis filed its answer and affirmative defenses to Amgen’s second amended counterclaims. On June 9, 2020, the New York Southern District Court entered an order granting Novartis’ motion for judgment on the pleadings that Novartis did not breach the 2017 Agreement, and denying Amgen’s motions for judgment on the pleadings seeking dismissal of Novartis’ amended complaint that Novartis did not breach the 2015 Agreement or the 2017 Agreement, and Novartis timely cured any breach. On June 23, 2020, Amgen filed a motion for clarification and/or reconsideration of the June 9, 2020 order, which was denied on September 14, 2020.

Two of those actions were brought in the Delaware District Court, captioned UFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund v. Amgen Inc., et al. (February 21, 2019) (Local 1500) and Cesar Castillo, Inc. v. Amgen Inc., et al. (February 26, 2019) (Castillo). The third action was brought in the New Jersey District Court, captioned Teamsters Local 237 Welfare Fund, et al. v. Amgen Inc., et al. (March 14, 2019) (Local 237) and the fourth action was brought in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania (the Eastern Pennsylvania District Court), captioned KPH Healthcare Services, Inc. a/k/a Kinney Drugs, Inc. v. Amgen Inc., et al (April 10, 2019) (KPH). Each of the lawsuits is brought on behalf of a putative class of direct or indirect purchasers of Sensipar® and alleges that the plaintiffs have overpaid for Sensipar® as a result of Amgen’s conduct that allegedly improperly delayed market entry by manufacturers of generic cinacalcet products. The lawsuits focus predominantly on the settlement among Amgen, Watson and Teva of the parties’ patent infringement litigation. Each of the lawsuits seeks, among other things, treble damages, equitable relief and attorneys’ fees and costs. On April 10, 2019, the plaintiff in the KPH lawsuit filed a motion seeking to have the four lawsuits consolidated and designated as a multidistrict litigation (MDL) in the Eastern Pennsylvania District Court, and the plaintiff in the Local 1500 lawsuit filed a motion seeking to have the four lawsuits, along with Cipla Ltd. v. Amgen Inc., consolidated and designated as a MDL in the Delaware District Court. On July 31, 2019, the MDL panel entered an order consolidating in the Delaware District Court the four class action lawsuits. On September 13, 2019, the plaintiffs filed amended complaints, and on October 15, 2019, Amgen filed its motion to dismiss both the direct purchaser plaintiffs’ consolidated class action complaint and the indirect purchaser end payor plaintiffs’ complaint. On December 6, 2019, the plaintiffs responded to Amgen’s motion to dismiss and, on January 10, 2020, Amgen filed its response. On February 6, 2020, the motions in the class action lawsuits were transferred to the U.S. Magistrate Judge for the District of Delaware (Magistrate Judge) for a recommendation. The MDL panel certified its conditional transfer order on February 6, 2020 transferring the additional class action lawsuit brought in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida, captioned MSP Recovery Claims v. Amgen Inc., et al., to the Delaware District Court. On July 22, 2020, the Magistrate Judge issued a recommendation to the Delaware District Court that the claims against Amgen be dismissed but leave be given to plaintiffs to amend their complaints. On August 5, 2020, the plaintiffs filed objections to the Magistrate Judge’s report and recommendation. On August 19, 2020, Amgen filed a response to the plaintiffs’ objections. On November 30, 2020, the District Court adopted the Magistrate Judge’s recommendation in part and denied it in part, denying Amgen’s motion to dismiss on the grounds that plaintiffs adequately alleged reverse payment claims but granted Amgen’s motion to dismiss with respect to the other Federal antitrust claims. On December 23, 2020, Teva, Watson and Actavis filed a motion for interlocutory appeal and for a stay pending appeal and Amgen filed its joinder (the 1292 Motion). On January 5, 2021, a joint status report was filed advising the Delaware District Court that the defendants are still considering whether to withdraw the 1292 Motion and plaintiffs’ offer to stay discovery, pending further rulings on motions to dismiss the amended complaints. On January 19, 2021, a joint status report was filed pursuant to the Delaware District Court’s January 6, 2021 order along with a stipulation to defer the 1292 Motion until after rulings on the amended complaints. Humira® Biosimilar Antitrust Class Actions From March to May 2019, twelve purported class actions against Amgen, along with AbbVie Inc. and AbbVie Biotechnology Ltd. (collectively, AbbVie), were filed in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois (the Illinois Northern District Court). The cases are captioned: UFCW Local 1500 Welfare Fund v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (March 18, 2019) (Local 1500); Fraternal Order of Police, Miami Lodge 20, Insurance Trust Fund v. AbbVie Inc., et al. (March 20, 2019); Mayor and City Council of Baltimore v.

In each case, the plaintiffs specifically allege that AbbVie has unlawfully monopolized the alleged market for Humira® and biosimilars of Humira®, including by creating an allegedly unlawful so-called patent thicket around Humira®. In the Local 1500, Sheet Metal Workers’ and Construction Industry cases, the plaintiffs further allege that AbbVie entered into allegedly unlawful market division agreements with Amgen and other companies that had developed Humira® biosimilars, including Bioepis, Mylan, Sandoz, Inc., Fresenius Kabi USA, LLC, Pfizer Inc. and Momenta Pharmaceuticals, Inc., in connection with the settlement of patent litigation relating to Humira®, whereby Amgen and the other defendants that have developed Humira® biosimilars were permitted to market those products in Europe as early as October 2018, while remaining off the market in the United States until 2023. In each of the Humira® Antitrust Class Actions other than the Local 1500 and Construction Industry cases, the plaintiffs allege that AbbVie and Amgen entered into an allegedly unlawful settlement agreement under which Amgen allegedly agreed to delay its entry into the U.S. market with AMGEVITATM (adalimumab), its Humira® biosimilar, in exchange for an alleged promise of exclusivity as the sole Humira® biosimilar in that market for five months, beginning in January 2023. In each of the Humira® Antitrust Class Actions, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, treble damages and attorney’s fees on behalf of a putative class of third-party payers and/or consumers that have indirectly purchased, paid for or provided reimbursement for Humira® in the United States. Defendants’ responses to the first six complaints were stayed by the court. On June 4, 2019, the Illinois Northern District Court entered an order consolidating the twelve purported class action cases for pre-trial purposes. On August 9, 2019, the plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint, naming as defendants Amgen, along with AbbVie, Bioepis, Sandoz, Inc. and Fresenius Kabi USA LLC. On October 11, 2019, the defendants filed a joint motion to dismiss the consolidated complaint (as well as brief individual motions), challenging the legal sufficiency of the plaintiffs’ allegations to state any claim for relief under the law. On November 19, 2019, plaintiffs filed their opposition to the motion to dismiss. On December 20, 2019, defendants filed their reply in support of the motion to dismiss. On June 8, 2020, the Illinois Northern District Court issued an order granting the motion by the defendants to dismiss the consolidated class action complaint. On June 29, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a status report asking the Illinois Northern District Court to convert the dismissal to one with prejudice. On June 30, 2020, the Illinois Northern District Court granted the motion. On July 28, 2020, the plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal. On October 5, 2020, the plaintiffs-appellants filed their opening brief to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit. Plaintiffs-appellants amicus briefs were filed in October 2020, including one by the Federal Trade Commission and one on behalf of 20 states, each filed on October 13, 2020. On December 21, 2020, the defendants-appellees filed their opposition brief. Defendants-appellees amicus briefs, including one by the Department of Justice, were filed on December 28, 2020. The plaintiffs-appellants’ reply brief was filed on February 1, 2021, and oral argument has been scheduled for February 25, 2021.

CodeBERT learnsgeneral-purpose representations that supportdownstream NL-PL applications such as nat-ural language code search, code documen-tation generation, etc.We develop Code-BERT with Transformer-based neural architec-ture, and train it with a hybrid objective func-tion that incorporates the pre-training task ofreplaced token detection, which is to detectplausible alternatives sampled from generators.This enables us to utilize both “bimodal” dataof NL-PL pairs and “unimodal” data, wherethe former provides input tokens for modeltraining while the latter helps to learn bet-ter generators.We evaluate CodeBERT ontwo NL-PL applications by ﬁne-tuning modelparameters.Results show that CodeBERTachieves state-of-the-art performance on bothnatural language code search and code docu-mentation generation. Furthermore, to inves-tigate what type of knowledge is learned inCodeBERT, we construct a dataset for NL-PLprobing, and evaluate in a zero-shot settingwhere parameters of pre-trained models areﬁxed. Results show that CodeBERT performsbetter than previous pre-trained models on NL-PL probing.11IntroductionLarge pre-trained models such as ELMo (Peterset al., 2018), GPT (Radford et al., 2018), BERT(Devlin et al., 2018), XLNet (Yang et al., 2019)∗Work done while this author was an intern at MicrosoftResearch Asia.1All the codes and data are available at https://github.com/microsoft/CodeBERTand RoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019) have dramati-cally improved the state-of-the-art on a variety ofnatural language processing (NLP) tasks. Thesepre-trained models learn effective contextual repre-sentations from massive unlabeled text optimizedby self-supervised objectives, such as maskedlanguage modeling, which predicts the originalmasked word from an artiﬁcially masked inputsequence. The success of pre-trained models inNLP also drives a surge of multi-modal pre-trainedmodels, such as ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019) forlanguage-image and VideoBERT (Sun et al., 2019)for language-video, which are learned from bi-modal data such as language-image pairs with bi-modal self-supervised objectives.In this work, we present CodeBERT, a bimodalpre-trained model for natural language (NL) andprogramming language (PL) like Python, Java,JavaScript, etc. CodeBERT captures the seman-tic connection between natural language and pro-gramming language, and produces general-purposerepresentations that can broadly support NL-PLunderstanding tasks (e.g. natural language codesearch) and generation tasks (e.g. code documen-tation generation). It is developed with the multi-layer Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017), which isadopted in a majority of large pre-trained models.In order to make use of both bimodal instancesof NL-PL pairs and large amount of available uni-modal codes, we train CodeBERT with a hybridobjective function, including standard masked lan-guage modeling (Devlin et al., 2018) and replacedtoken detection (Clark et al., 2020), where uni-modal codes help to learn better generators forproducing better alternative tokens for the latterobjective.We train CodeBERT from Github code reposito-\f1537ries in 6 programming languages, where bimodaldatapoints are codes that pair with function-levelnatural language documentations (Husain et al.,2019). Training is conducted in a setting similarto that of multilingual BERT (Pires et al., 2019),in which case one pre-trained model is learned for6 programming languages with no explicit mark-ers used to denote the input programming lan-guage.We evaluate CodeBERT on two down-stream NL-PL tasks, including natural languagecode search and code documentation generation.Results show that ﬁne-tuning the parameters ofCodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art performanceon both tasks. To further investigate what type ofknowledge is learned in CodeBERT, we constructa dataset for NL-PL probing, and test CodeBERTin a zero-shot scenario, i.e. without ﬁne-tuning theparameters of CodeBERT. We ﬁnd that CodeBERTconsistently outperforms RoBERTa, a purely natu-ral language-based pre-trained model. The contri-butions of this work are as follows:• CodeBERT is the ﬁrst large NL-PL pre-trained model for multiple programming lan-guages.• Empirical results show that CodeBERT is ef-fective in both code search and code-to-textgeneration tasks.• We further created a dataset which is the ﬁrstone to investigate the probing ability of thecode-based pre-trained models.2Background2.1Pre-Trained Models in NLPLarge pre-trained models (Peters et al., 2018; Rad-ford et al., 2018; Devlin et al., 2018; Yang et al.,2019; Liu et al., 2019; Raffel et al., 2019) havebrought dramatic empirical improvements on al-most every NLP task in the past few years. Suc-cessful approaches train deep neural networks onlarge-scale plain texts with self-supervised learningobjectives. One of the most representative neuralarchitectures is the Transformer (Vaswani et al.,2017), which is also the one used in this work. Itcontains multiple self-attention layers, and can beconventionally learned with gradient decent in anend-to-end manner as every component is differen-tiable. The terminology “self-supervised” meansthat supervisions used for pre-training are auto-matically collected from raw data without manualannotation. Dominant learning objectives are lan-guage modeling and its variations. For example,in GPT (Radford et al., 2018), the learning objec-tive is language modeling, namely predicting thenext word wk given the preceding context words{w1, w2, ..., wk−1}. As the ultimate goal of pre-training is not to train a good language model, it isdesirable to consider both preceding and followingcontexts to learn better general-purpose contextualrepresentations. This leads us to the masked lan-guage modeling objective used in BERT (Devlinet al., 2018), which learns to predict the maskedwords of a randomly masked word sequence givensurrounding contexts. Masked language modelingis also used as one of the two learning objectivesfor training CodeBERT.2.2Multi-Modal Pre-Trained ModelsThe remarkable success of the pre-trained modelin NLP has driven the development of multi-modalpre-trained model that learns implicit alignmentbetween inputs of different modalities. These mod-els are typically learned from bimodal data, suchas pairs of language-image or pairs of language-video. For example, ViLBERT (Lu et al., 2019)learns from image caption data, where the modellearns by reconstructing categories of masked im-age region or masked words given the observedinputs, and meanwhile predicting whether the cap-tion describes the image content or not.Simi-larly, VideoBERT (Sun et al., 2019) learns fromlanguage-video data and is trained by video andtext masked token prediction. Our work belongsto this line of research as we regard NL and PLas different modalities. Our method differs fromprevious works in that the fuels for model train-ing include not only bimodal data of NL-PL pairs,but larger amounts of unimodal data such as codeswithout paired documentations.A concurrent work (Kanade et al., 2019) usesmasked language modeling and next sentence pre-diction as the objective to train a BERT model onPython source codes, where a sentence is a log-ical code line as deﬁned by the Python standard.In terms of the pre-training process, CodeBERTdiffers from their work in that (1) CodeBERT istrained in a cross-modal style and leverages bothbimodal NL-PL data and unimodal PL/NL data, (2)CodeBERT is pre-trained over six programminglanguages, and (3) CodeBERT is trained with anew learning objective based on replaced token\f1538detection.3CodeBERTWe describe the details about CodeBERT in thissection, including the model architecture, the inputand output representations, the objectives and dataused for training CodeBERT, and how to ﬁne-tuneCodeBERT when it is applied to downstream tasks.3.1Model ArchitectureWe follow BERT (Devlin et al., 2018) andRoBERTa (Liu et al., 2019), and use multi-layerbidirectional Transformer (Vaswani et al., 2017) asthe model architecture of CodeBERT. We will notreview the ubiquitous Transformer architecture indetail. We develop CodeBERT by using exactly thesame model architecture as RoBERTa-base. Thetotal number of model parameters is 125M.3.2Input/Output RepresentationsIn the pre-training phase, we set the input as theconcatenation of two segments with a special sepa-rator token, namely [CLS], w1, w2, ..wn, [SEP],c1, c2, ..., cm, [EOS]. One segment is natural lan-guage text, and another is code from a certain pro-gramming language. [CLS] is a special token infront of the two segments, whose ﬁnal hidden repre-sentation is considered as the aggregated sequencerepresentation for classiﬁcation or ranking. Follow-ing the standard way of processing text in Trans-former, we regard a natural language text as a se-quence of words, and split it as WordPiece (Wuet al., 2016). We regard a piece of code as a se-quence of tokens.The output of CodeBERT includes (1) contextualvector representation of each token, for both naturallanguage and code, and (2) the representation of[CLS], which works as the aggregated sequencerepresentation.3.3Pre-Training DataWe train CodeBERT with both bimodal data, whichrefers to parallel data of natural language-codepairs, and unimodal data, which stands for codeswithout paired natural language texts and naturallanguage without paired codes.We use datapoints from Github repositories,where each bimodal datapoint is an individualfunction with paired documentation, and each uni-modal code is a function without paired documen-tation. Speciﬁcally, we use a recent large datasetTRAINING DATAbimodal DATAunimodal CODESGO319,256726,768JAVA500,7541,569,889JAVASCRIPT143,2521,857,835PHP662,907977,821PYTHON458,2191,156,085RUBY52,905164,048ALL2,137,2936,452,446Table 1: Statistics of the dataset used for training Code-BERT.provided by Husain et al. (2019), which includes2.1M bimodal datapoints and 6.4M unimodal codesacross six programming languages (Python, Java,JavaScript, PHP, Ruby, and Go). Data statistics isshown in Table 1.2The data comes from publicly available open-source non-fork GitHub repositories and are ﬁl-tered with a set of constraints and rules. For ex-ample, (1) each project should be used by at leastone other project, (2) each documentation is trun-cated to the ﬁrst paragraph, (3) documentationsshorter than three tokens are removed, (4) func-tions shorter than three lines are removed, and (5)function names with substring “test” are removed.An example of the data is given in Figure 1 3.Figure 1: An example of the NL-PL pair, where NL isthe ﬁrst paragraph (ﬁlled in red) from the documenta-tion (dashed line in black) of a function.3.4Pre-Training CodeBERTWe describe the two objectives used for trainingCodeBERT here. The ﬁrst objective is maskedlanguage modeling (MLM), which has proven ef-fective in literature (Devlin et al., 2018; Liu et al.,2Since we will evaluate on the natural language codesearch task, we only use the training data of Husain et al.(2019) to train CodeBERT with no access to the dev and test-ing data.3The source of the illustrating example comes fromhttps://github.com/apache/spark/blob/618d6bff71073c8c93501ab7392c3cc579730f0b/python/pyspark/rdd.py#L125-L138\f1539NL GeneratorNL-Code Discriminator[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑤𝑤2𝑤3𝑤4[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑤𝑤1𝑤2𝑤3𝑤4𝑤5[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑐𝑐5𝑐3𝑐4[𝑀𝐴𝑆𝐾]𝑐𝑐1𝑐2𝑐3𝑐4𝑐5𝑐6𝑐1𝑤51𝑤2𝑤3𝑤4𝑤5𝑐29𝑐5𝑐3𝑐4𝑐162𝑐1originalreplacedCode GeneratororiginaloriginaloriginalreplacedoriginaloriginaloriginaloriginalreplacedsamplesamplesamplesampleFigure 2: An illustration about the replaced token detection objective. Both NL and code generators are languagemodels, which generate plausible tokens for masked positions based on surrounding contexts. NL-Code discrimi-nator is the targeted pre-trained model, which is trained via detecting plausible alternatives tokens sampled fromNL and PL generators. NL-Code discriminator is used for producing general-purpose representations in the ﬁne-tuning step. Both NL and code generators are thrown out in the ﬁne-tuning step.2019; Sun et al., 2019). We apply masked languagemodeling on bimodal data of NL-PL pairs. The sec-ond objective is replaced token detection (RTD),which further uses a large amount of unimodal data,such as codes without paired natural language texts.Detailed hyper-parameters for model pre-trainingare given in Appendix B.1.Objective #1:Masked Language Modeling(MLM)Given a datapoint of NL-PL pair (x ={w, c}) as input, where w is a sequence of NLwords and c is a sequence of PL tokens, we ﬁrstselect a random set of positions for both NL and PLto mask out (i.e. mw and mc, respectively), andthen replace the selected positions with a special[MASK] token. Following Devlin et al. (2018),15% of the tokens from x are masked out.mwi ∼unif{1, |w|} for i = 1 to |w|(1)mci ∼unif{1, |c|} for i = 1 to |c|(2)wmasked = REPLACE(w, mw, [MASK])(3)cmasked = REPLACE(c, mc, [MASK])(4)x = w + c(5)The MLM objective is to predict the original to-kens which are masked out, formulated as follows,where pD1 is the discriminator which predicts atoken from a large vocabulary.LMLM(θ)=Xi∈mw∪mc−log pD1(xi|wmasked,cmasked)(6)Objective #2: Replaced Token Detection (RTD)In the MLM objective, only bimodal data (i.e. data-points of NL-PL pairs) is used for training. Here wepresent the objective of replaced token detection.The RTD objective (Clark et al., 2020) is origi-nally developed for efﬁciently learning pre-trainedmodel for natural language. We adapt it in our sce-nario, with the advantage of using both bimodaland unimodal data for training. Speciﬁcally, thereare two data generators here, an NL generator pGwand a PL generator pGc, both for generating plau-sible alternatives for the set of randomly maskedpositions.ˆwi ∼pGw(wi|wmasked) for i ∈mw(7)ˆci ∼pGc(ci|cmasked) for i ∈mc(8)wcorrupt = REPLACE(w, mw, ˆw)(9)ccorrupt = REPLACE(c, mc, ˆc)(10)xcorrupt = wcorrupt + ccorrupt(11)The discriminator is trained to determine whethera word is the original one or not, which is a binaryclassiﬁcation problem. It is worth noting that theRTD objective is applied to every position in theinput, and it differs from GAN (generative adver-sarial network) in that if a generator happens toproduce the correct token, the label of that tokenis “real” instead of “fake” (Clark et al., 2020). Theloss function of RTD with regard to the discrimina-tor parameterized by θ is given below, where δ(i) is\f1540an indicator function and pD2 is the discriminatorthat predicts the probability of the i-th word beingoriginal.LRTD(θ) =|w|+|c|Xi=1\u0012δ(i)log pD2(xcorrupt, i)+\u00101 −δ(i)\u0011\u00101 −log pD2(xcorrupt, i)\u0011\u0013(12)δ(i) =(1,if xcorrupti= xi.0,otherwise.(13)There are many different ways to implement thegenerators. In this work, we implement two ef-ﬁcient n-gram language models (Jurafsky, 2000)with bidirectional contexts, one for NL and onefor PL, and learn them from corresponding uni-model datapoints, respectively. The approach iseasily generalized to learn bimodal generators oruse more complicated generators like Transformer-based neural architecture learned in a joint manner.We leave these to future work. The PL training datais the unimodal codes as shown in Table 1, and theNL training data comes from the documentationsfrom bimodal data. One could easily extend thesetwo training datasets to larger amount. The ﬁnalloss function are given below.minθLMLM(θ) + LRTD(θ)(14)3.5Fine-Tuning CodeBERTWe have different settings to use CodeBERT indownstream NL-PL tasks. For example, in naturallanguage code search, we feed the input as thesame way as the pre-training phase and use therepresentation of [CLS] to measure the semanticrelevance between code and natural language query,while in code-to-text generation, we use an encoder-decoder framework and initialize the encoder ofa generative model with CodeBERT. Details aregiven in the experiment section.4ExperimentWe present empirical results in this section to verifythe effectiveness of CodeBERT. We ﬁrst describethe use of CodeBERT in natural language codesearch (§4.1), in a way that model parameters ofCodeBERT are ﬁne-tuned. After that, we presentthe NL-PL probing task (§4.2), and evaluate Code-BERT in a zero-shot setting where the parametersof CodeBERT are ﬁxed. Finally, we evaluate Code-BERT on a generation problem, i.e. code documen-tation generation (§4.3), and further evaluate on aprogramming language which is never seen in thetraining phase (§4.4).4.1Natural Language Code SearchGiven a natural language as the input, the objec-tive of code search is to ﬁnd the most semanticallyrelated code from a collection of codes. We con-duct experiments on the CodeSearchNet corpus(Husain et al., 2019) 4. We follow the ofﬁcial evalu-ation metric to calculate the Mean Reciprocal Rank(MRR) for each pair of test data (c, w) over a ﬁxedset of 999 distractor codes. We further calculate themacro-average MRR for all languages as an overallevaluation metric. It is helpful to note that this met-ric differs from the AVG metric in the original pa-per, where the answer is retrieved from candidatesfrom all six languages. We ﬁne-tune a language-speciﬁc model for each programming language5.We train each model with a binary classiﬁcationloss function, where a softmax layer is connectedto the representation of [CLS]. Both training andvalidation datasets are created in a way that posi-tive and negative samples are balanced. Negativesamples consist of balanced number of instanceswith randomly replaced NL (i.e. (c, ˆw)) and PL(i.e. (ˆc, w)). Detailed hyper-parameters for modelﬁne-tuning are given in Appendix B.2.Model ComparisonsTable 2 shows the resultsof different approaches on the CodeSearchNet cor-pus. The ﬁrst four rows are reported by Husainet al. (2019), which are joint embeddings of NL andPL (Gu et al., 2018; Mitra et al., 2018). NBOWrepresents neural bag-of-words. CNN, BIRNNand SELFATT stand for 1D convolultional neu-ral network (Kim, 2014), bidirectional GRU-basedrecurrent neural network (Cho et al., 2014), andmulti-head attention (Vaswani et al., 2017), respec-tively.We report the remaining numbers in Table 2.We train all these pre-trained models by regardingcodes as a sequence of tokens. We also continu-ously train RoBERTa only on codes from Code-SearchNet with masked language modeling. Re-sults show that CodeBERT consistently performs4More details about the dataset are given in Appendix A.5We have ﬁne-tuned a multi-lingual model for six program-ming languages, but ﬁnd that it performs worse that ﬁne-tuninga language-speciﬁc model for each programming language.\f1541MODELRUBYJAVASCRIPTGOPYTHONJAVAPHPMA-AVGNBOW0.42850.46070.64090.58090.51400.48350.5181CNN0.24500.35230.62740.57080.52700.52940.4753BIRNN0.08350.15300.45240.32130.28650.25120.2580SELFATT0.36510.45060.68090.69220.58660.60110.5628ROBERTA0.62450.60600.82040.80870.66590.65760.6972PT W/ CODE ONLY (INIT=S)0.57120.55570.79290.78550.65670.61720.6632PT W/ CODE ONLY (INIT=R)0.66120.64020.81910.84380.72130.67060.7260CODEBERT (MLM, INIT=S)0.56950.60290.83040.82610.71420.65560.6998CODEBERT (MLM, INIT=R)0.68980.69970.83830.86470.74760.68930.7549CODEBERT (RTD, INIT=R)0.64140.65120.82850.82630.71500.67740.7233CODEBERT (MLM+RTD, INIT=R)0.69260.70590.84000.86850.74840.70620.7603Table 2: Results on natural language code retrieval.

CodeBERT (MLM) learned fromscratch performs better than RoBERTa. Unsur-prisingly, initializing CodeBERT with RoBERTaimproves the performance 6.4.2NL-PL ProbingIn the previous subsection, we show the empiricaleffectiveness of CodeBERT in a setting that theparameters of CodeBERT are ﬁne-tuned in down-stream tasks. In this subsection, we further inves-tigate what type of knowledge is learned in Code-BERT without modifying the parameters.Task Formulation and Data ConstructionFol-lowing the probing experiments in NLP (Petroniet al., 2019; Talmor et al., 2019), we study NL-PL probing here. Since there is no existing worktowards this goal, we formulate the problem ofNL-PL probing and create the dataset by ourselves.Given an NL-PL pair (c, w), the goal of NL-PLprobing is to test model’s ability to correctly pre-dict/recover the masked token of interest (either acode token ci or word token wj) among distractors.There are two major types of distractors: one is thewhole target vocabulary used for the masked lan-guage modeling objective (Petroni et al., 2019), andanother one has fewer candidates which are ﬁlter orcurated based on experts’ understanding about theability to be tested (Talmor et al., 2019). We followthe second direction and formulate NL-PL probingas a multi-choice question answering task, wherethe question is cloze-style in which a certain token6We further give a learning curve of different pre-trainedmodels in the ﬁne-tuning process in Appendix C.is replaced by [MASK] and distractor candidateanswers are curated based on our expertise.Speciﬁcally, we evaluate on the NL side and PLside, respectively. To ease the effort of data col-lection, we collect data automatically from NL-PLpairs in both validation and testing sets of Code-SearchNet, both of which are unseen in the pre-training phase. To evaluate on the NL side, weselect NL-PL pairs whose NL documentations in-clude one of the six keywords (max, maximize, min,minimize, less, greater), and group them to fourcandidates by merging ﬁrst two keywords and themiddle two keywords. The task is to ask pre-trainedmodels to select the correct one instead of threeother distractors. That is to say, the input in thissetting includes the complete code and a maskedNL documentation. The goal is to select the correctanswer from four candidates. For the PL side, weselect codes containing keywords max and min, andformulate the task as a two-choice answer selectionproblem. Here, the input includes complete NLdocumentation and a masked PL code, and the goalis to select the correct answer from two candidates.Since code completion is an important scenario,we would like to test model’s ability in predictingthe correct token merely based on preceding PLcontexts. Therefore, we add an additional settingfor PL side, where the input includes the completeNL documentation and preceding PL codes. Datastatistics is given in the top two rows in Table 3.Model ComparisonsResults are given in Table3. We report accuracy, namely the number of cor-rectly predicted instances over the number of allinstances, for each programming language.

The numbers withonly preceding contexts are lower than that withbidirectional contexts, which suggests that codecompletion is challenging. We leave it as a futurework.We further give a case study on PL-NL probing.We mask NL token and PL token separately, andreport the predicted probabilities of RoBERTa andCodeBERT. Figure 3 illustrates the example of apython code7. We can see that RoBERTa fails inboth cases, whereas CodeBERT makes the correctprediction in both NL and PL settings.4.3Code Documentation GenerationAlthough the pre-training objective of Code-BERT does not include generation-based objectives(Lewis et al., 2019), we would like to investigateto what extent does CodeBERT perform on gen-eration tasks. Speciﬁcally, we study code-to-NLgeneration, and report results for the documenta-tion generation task on CodeSearchNet Corpus insix programming languages.

To this end, we study the task of gen-erating a natural language summary of a C# codesnippet. We conduct experiments on the datasetof CodeNN (Iyer et al., 2016)9, which consists of66,015 pairs of questions and answers automati-cally collected from StackOverﬂow. This datasetis challenging since the scale of dataset is ordersof magnitude smaller than CodeSearchNet Corpus.We evaluate models using smoothed BLEU-4 scoreand use the same evaluation scripts as Iyer et al.(2016).MODELBLEUMOSES (KOEHN ET AL., 2007)11.57IR13.66SUM-NN (RUSH ET AL., 2015)19.312-LAYER BILSTM19.78TRANSFORMER (VASWANI ET AL., 2017)19.68TREELSTM (TAI ET AL., 2015)20.11CODENN (IYER ET AL., 2016)20.53CODE2SEQ (ALON ET AL., 2019)23.04ROBERTA19.81PRE-TRAIN W/ CODE ONLY20.65CODEBERT (RTD)22.14CODEBERT (MLM)22.32CODEBERT (MLM+RTD)22.36Table 5: Code-to-NL generation on C# language.Model ComparisonsTable 5 shows that ourmodel with MLM and RTD pre-training objectivesachieves 22.36 BLEU score and improves by 2.55points over RoBERTa, which illustrates CodeBERT8We further give some output examples in Appendix E.9https://github.com/sriniiyer/codenncould generalize better to other programming lan-guage which is never seen in the pre-training step.However, our model achieve slightly lower resultsthan code2seq (Alon et al., 2019). The main reasoncould be that code2seq makes use of compositionalpaths in its abstract syntax tree (AST) while Code-BERT only takes original code as the input. Wehave trained a version of CodeBERT by traversingthe tree structure of AST following a certain order,but applying that model does not bring improve-ments on generation tasks. This shows a potentialdirection to improve CodeBERT by incorporatingAST.5ConclusionIn this paper, we present CodeBERT, which to thebest of our knowledge is the ﬁrst large bimodalpre-trained model for natural language and pro-gramming language. We train CodeBERT on bothbimodal and unimodal data, and show that ﬁne-tuning CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance on downstream tasks including natural lan-guage code search and code-to-documentation gen-eration. To further investigate the knowledge em-bodied in pre-trained models, we formulate the taskof NL-PL probing and create a dataset for probing.We regard the probing task as a cloze-style answerselection problem, and curate distractors for bothNL and PL parts. Results show that, with modelparameters ﬁxed, CodeBERT performs better thanRoBERTa and a continuously trained model usingcodes only.There are many potential directions for furtherresearch on this ﬁeld. First, one could learn bettergenerators with bimodal evidence or more compli-cated neural architecture to improve the replaced to-ken detection objective. Second, the loss functionsof CodeBERT mainly target on NL-PL understand-ing tasks. Although CodeBERT achieves strongBLEU scores on code-to-documentation genera-tion, the CodeBERT itself could be further im-proved by generation-related learning objectives.\f1544How to successfully incorporate AST into the pre-training step is also an attractive direction. Third,we plan to apply CodeBERT to more NL-PL re-lated tasks, and extend it to more programminglanguages. Flexible and powerful domain/languageadaptation methods are necessary to generalizewell.AcknowledgmentsXiaocheng Feng is the corresponding author of thiswork.

It combines 16 interconnectedNVIDIA Tesla V100 with 32GB memory. We usethe following set of hyper-parameters to train mod-els: batchsize is 2,048 and learning rate is 5e-4. Weuse Adam to update the parameters and set the num-ber of warmup steps as 10K. We set the max lengthas 512 and the max training step is 100K. Training1,000 batches of data costs 600 minutes with MLMobjective, 120 minutes with RTD objective.B.2CodeSearchIn the ﬁne-turning step, we set the learning rate as1e-5, the batch size as 64, the max sequence lengthas 200 and the max ﬁne-tuning epoch as 8. As thesame with pre-training, We use Adam to update theparameters. We choose the model performed beston the development set, and use that to evaluate onthe test set.B.3Code Summarization on SixProgramming LanguagesWe use Transformer with 6 layers, 768 dimensionalhidden states and 12 attention heads as our decoderin all settings.

We show results on Pythonand Java.DLate FusionIn section §4.1 , we show that CodeBERT per-forms well in the setting where natural languagesand codes have early interactions. Here, we in-vestigate whether CodeBERT is good at workingas a uniﬁed encoder. We apply CodeBERT fornatural language code search in a later fusion set-ting, where CodeBERT ﬁrst encodes NL and PLseparately, and then calculates the similarity by dot-product. In this way, code search is equivalent toﬁnd the nearest codes in the shared vector space.This scenario also facilitates the use of CodeBERTin an online system, where the representations ofcodes are calculated in advance. In the runtime, asystem only needs to compute the representationof NL and vector-based dot-product.We ﬁne-tune CodeBERT with the following ob-jective, which maximizes the dot-product of theground truth while minimizing the dot-product ofdistractors.−1NXilog\u0012exp\u0000Enc(ci)⊺Enc(wi)\u0001Pj exp\u0000Enc(cj)⊺Enc(wi)\u0001\u0013(15)Results are given in Table 7.

In addition, we computed 11 baselinemetrics, with 8 commonly applied base-lines (BLEU, SentBLEU, NIST, WER,PER, TER, CDER, and chrF) and 3 reim-plementations (chrF+, sacreBLEU-BLEU,and sacreBLEU-chrF). Metrics were evalu-ated on the system level, how well a givenmetric correlates with the WMT19 offi-cial manual ranking, and segment level,how well the metric correlates with humanjudgements of segment quality. This year,we use direct assessment (DA) as our onlyform of manual evaluation.1IntroductionTo determine system performance in machinetranslation (MT), it is often more practicalto use an automatic evaluation, rather thana manual one. Manual/human evaluation canbe costly and time consuming, and so an au-tomatic evaluation metric, given that it suffi-ciently correlates with manual evaluation, canbe useful in developmental cycles. In studiesinvolving hyperparameter tuning or architec-ture search, automatic metrics are necessaryas the amount of human effort implicated inmanual evaluation is generally prohibitivelylarge.As objective, reproducible quantities,metrics can also facilitate cross-paper compar-isons. The WMT Metrics Shared Task1 annu-ally serves as a venue to validate the use ofexisting metrics (including baselines such asBLEU), and to develop new ones; see Koehnand Monz (2006) through Ma et al. (2018).In the setup of our Metrics Shared Task,an automatic metric compares an MT sys-tem’s output translations with manual ref-erence translations to produce:either (a)system-level score, i.e. a single overall scorefor the given MT system, or (b) segment-levelscores for each of the output translations, orboth.This year we teamed up with the organizersof the QE Task and hosted “QE as a Metric” asa joint task. In the setup of the Quality Esti-mation Task (Fonseca et al., 2019), no human-produced translations are provided to estimatethe quality of output translations. Quality es-timation (QE) methods are built to assess MToutput based on the source or based on thetranslation itself. In this task, QE developerswere invited to perform the same scoring asstandard metrics participants, with the excep-tion that they refrain from using a referencetranslation in production of their scores. Wethen evaluate the QE submissions in exactlythe same way as regular metrics are evalu-ated, see below.From the point of view ofcorrelation with manual judgements, there isno difference in metrics using or not using ref-erences.The source, reference texts, and MT sys-tem outputs for the Metrics task come fromthe News Translation Task (Barrault et al.,2019, which we denote as Findings 2019). Thetexts were drawn from the news domain andinvolve translations of English (en) to/from1http://www.statmt.org/wmt19/metrics-task.html\f63Czech (cs), German (de), Finnish (fi), Gu-jarati (gu), Kazakh (kk), Lithuanian (lt), Rus-sian (ru), and Chinese (zh), but excluding cs-en (15 language pairs). Three other languagepairs not including English were also manu-ally evaluated as part of the News TranslationTask: German→Czech and German↔French.In total, metrics could participate in 18 lan-guage pairs, with 10 target languages.In the following, we first give an overview ofthe task (Section 2) and summarize the base-line (Section 3) and submitted (Section 4) met-rics. The results for system- and segment-levelevaluation are provided in Sections 5.1 and5.2, respectively, followed by a joint discussionSection 6.2Task SetupThis year, we provided task participants withone test set for each examined language pair,i.e. a set of source texts (which are commonlyignored by MT metrics), corresponding MToutputs (these are the key inputs to be scored)and a reference translation (held out for theparticipants of “QE as a Metric” track).In the system-level, metrics aim to corre-late with a system’s score which is an aver-age over many human judgments of segmenttranslation quality produced by the given sys-tem.In the segment-level, metrics aim toproduce scores that correlate best with a hu-man ranking judgment of two output trans-lations for a given source segment (more onthe manual quality assessment in Section 2.3).Participants were free to choose which lan-guage pairs and tracks (system/segment andreference-based/reference-free) they wanted totake part in.2.1Source and Reference TextsThe source and reference texts we use arenewstest2019 from this year’s WMT NewsTranslation Task (see Findings 2019).Thisset contains approximately 2,000 sentences foreach translation direction (except Gujarati,Kazakh and Lithuanian which have approx-imately 1,000 sentences each, and Germanto/from French which has 1701 sentences).The reference translations provided in new-stest2019 were created in the same direc-tion as the MT systems were translating.The exceptions are German→Czech whereboth sides are translations from English andGerman↔French which followed last years’practice. Last year and the years before, thedataset consisted of two halves, one originat-ing in the source language and one in the tar-get language.This however lead to adverseartifacts in MT evaluation.2.2System OutputsThe results of the Metrics Task are affectedby the actual set of MT systems participatingin a given translation direction. On one hand,if all systems are very close in their transla-tion quality, then even humans will struggleto rank them. This in turn will make the taskfor MT metrics very hard. On the other hand,if the task includes a wide range of systemsof varying quality, correlating with humansshould be generally easier, see Section 6.1 fora discussion on this. One can also expect thatif the evaluated systems are of different types,they will exhibit different error patterns andvarious MT metrics can be differently sensi-tive to these patterns.This year, all MT systems included in theMetrics Task come from the News TranslationTask (see Findings 2019). There are howeverstill noticeable differences among the variouslanguage pairs.• UnsupervisedMTSystems.TheGerman→Czech research systems weretrained in an unsupervised fashion, i.e.without the access to parallel Czech-German texts (except for a couple ofthousand sentences used primarily for val-idation).We thus expect the researchGerman-Czech systems to be “more cre-ative” and depart further away from thereferences.The online systems in thislanguage directions are however standardMT systems so the German-Czech evalu-ation could be to some extent bimodal.• EU Election.The French↔Germantranslation was focused on a sub-domainof news, namely texts related EU Elec-tion. Various MT system developers mayhave invested more or less time to the do-main adaptation.• Regular News Tasks Systems. These\f64are all the other MT systems in theevaluation; differing in whether they aretrained only on WMT provided data(“Constrained”, or “Unconstrained”) asin the previous years. All the freely avail-able web services (online MT systems) aredeemed unconstrained.Overall, the results are based on 233 systemsacross 18 language pairs.22.3Manual Quality AssessmentDirect Assessment (DA, Graham et al., 2013,2014a, 2016) was employed as the source of the“golden truth” to evaluate metrics again thisyear.The details of this method of humanevaluation are provided in Findings 2019.The basis of DA is to collect a large numberof quality assessments (a number on a scale of1–100, i.e. effectively a continuous scale) forthe outputs of all MT systems. These scoresare then standardized per annotator.In the past years, the underlying man-ual scores were reference-based (human judgeshad access to the same reference translationas the MT quality metric). This year, the of-ficial WMT19 scores are reference-based (or“monolingual”) for some language pairs andreference-free (or “bilingual”) for others.3Due to these different types of golden truthcollection, reference-based language pairs arein a closer match with the standard reference-based metrics, while the reference-free lan-guage pairs are better fit for the “QE as ametric” subtask.Note that system-level manual scores aredifferent than those of the segment-level. Sincefor segment-level evaluation, collecting enoughDA judgements for each segment is infeasible,so we resort to converting DA judgements to2This year, we do not use the artificially constructed“hybrid systems” (Graham and Liu, 2016) because theconfidence on the ranking of system-level metrics is suf-ficient even without hybrids.3Specifically,the reference-based language pairswere those where the anticipated translation qualitywas lower or where the manual judgements were ob-tained with the help of anonymous crowdsourcing.Most of these cases were translations into English (fi-en, gu-en, kk-en, lt-en, ru-en and zh-en) and then thelanguage pairs not involving English (de-cs, de-fr andfr-de). The reference-less (bilingual) evaluations werethose where mainly MT researchers themselves wereinvolved in the annotations: en-cs, en-de, en-fi, en-gu,en-kk, en-lt, en-ru, en-zh.golden truth expressed as relative rankings, seeSection 2.3.2.The exact methods used to calculate corre-lations of participating metrics with the goldentruth are described below, in the two sectionsfor system-level evaluation (Section 5.1) andsegment-level evaluation (Section 5.2).2.3.1System-level Golden Truth: DAFor the system-level evaluation, the collectedcontinuous DA scores, standardized for eachannotator, are averaged across all assessed seg-ments for each MT system to produce a scalarrating for the system’s performance.The underlying set of assessed segments isdifferent for each system. Thanks to the factthat the system-level DA score is an averageover many judgments, mean scores are consis-tent and have been found to be reproducible(Graham et al., 2013). For more details seeFindings 2019.2.3.2Segment-level Golden Truth:daRRStarting from Bojar et al. (2017), when WMTfully switched to DA, we had to come up with asolid golden standard for segment-level judge-ments. Standard DA scores are reliable onlywhen averaged over sufficient number of judg-ments.4Fortunately, when we have at least two DAscores for translations of the same source in-put, it is possible to convert those DA scoresinto a relative ranking judgement, if the dif-ference in DA scores allows conclusion thatone translation is better than the other.Inthe following, we denote these re-interpretedDA judgements as “daRR”, to distinguishit clearly from the relative ranking (“RR”)golden truth used in the past years.54For segment-level evaluation, one would need tocollect many manual evaluations of the exact same seg-ment as produced by each MT system. Such a samplingwould be however wasteful for the evaluation needed byWMT, so only some MT systems happen to be evalu-ated for a given input sentence. In principle, we wouldlike to return to DA’s standard segment-level evalua-tion in future, where a minimum of 15 human judge-ments of translation quality are collected per transla-tion and combined to get highly accurate scores fortranslations, but this would increase annotation costs.5Since the analogue rating scale employed by DA ismarked at the 0-25-50-75-100 points, we use 25 pointsas the minimum required difference between two sys-tem scores to produce daRR judgements.

Conver-sion of scores in this way produced a large setof daRR judgements for all language pairs,rely on judgements collected from known-reliable vol-unteers and crowd-sourced workers who passed DA’squality control mechanism.Any inconsistency thatcould arise from reliance on DA judgements collectedfrom low quality crowd-sourcing is thus prevented.shown in Table 1 due to combinatorial ad-vantage of extracting daRR judgements fromall possible pairs of translations of the samesource input. We see that only German-Frenchand esp. French-German can suffer from in-sufficient number of these simulated pairwisecomparisons.The daRR judgements serve as the goldenstandardforsegment-levelevaluationinWMT19.3Baseline MetricsIn addition to validating popular metrics, in-cluding baselines metrics serves as comparisonand prevents “loss of knowledge” as mentionedby Bojar et al. (2016).Moses scorer6 is one of the MT evaluationtools that aggregated several useful metricsover the time.Since Macháček and Bojar(2013), we have been using Moses scorer toprovide most of the baseline metrics and keptencouraging authors of well-performing MTmetrics to include them in Moses scorer.7The baselines we report are:BLEUandNIST The metrics BLEU(Papinenietal.,2002)andNIST(Doddington,2002)werecomputedusingmteval-v13a.pl8fromtheOpenMTEvaluationCampaign.Thetoolincludesitsowntokeniza-tion.We run mteval with the flag--international-tokenization.9TER, WER, PER and CDER.

The metrics sacreBLEU-BLEUand sacreBLEU-chrF (Post, 2018a)are re-implementation of BLEU and chrFrespectively. We ran sacreBLEU-chrFwith the same parameters as chrF, buttheir scores are slightly different.

For scoring Chinese with base-line metrics, we thus pre-processed MT out-puts and reference translations with the scripttokenizeChinese.py11 by Shujian Huang,which separates Chinese characters from eachother and also from non-Chinese parts.10We originally planned to use the chrF implemen-tation which was recently made available in MosesScorer but it mishandles Unicode characters for now.11http://hdl.handle.net/11346/WMT17-TVXH4Submitted MetricsTable 2 lists the participants of the WMT19Shared Metrics Task, along with their metricsand links to the source code where available.We have collected 24 metrics from a total of 13research groups, with 10 reference-less “met-rics” submitted to the joint task “QE as a Met-rich” with WMT19 Quality Estimation Task.The rest of this section provides a brief sum-mary of all the metrics that participated.4.1BEERBEER (Stanojević and Sima’an, 2015) is atrained evaluation metric with a linear modelthat combines sub-word feature indicators(character n-grams) and global word order fea-tures (skip bigrams) to achieve a language ag-nostic and fast to compute evaluation metric.BEER has participated in previous years ofthe evaluation task.4.2BERTrBERTr (Mathur et al., 2019) uses contextualword embeddings to compare the MT outputwith the reference translation.The BERTr score of a translation is theaveragerecallscoreoveralltokens,us-ing a relaxed version of token matchingbased on BERT embeddings:namely, com-puting the maximum cosine similarity be-tweentheembeddingofareferenceto-kenagainstanytokenintheMTout-put.BERTr uses bert_base_uncased em-beddings for the to-English language pairs,and bert_base_multilingual_cased embed-dings for all other language pairs.4.3CharacTERCharacTER (Wang et al., 2016b,a), identi-cal to the 2016 setup, is a character-level met-ric inspired by the commonly applied transla-tion edit rate (TER). It is defined as the mini-mum number of character edits required to ad-just a hypothesis, until it completely matchesthe reference, normalized by the length of thehypothesis sentence. CharacTER calculatesthe character-level edit distance while per-forming the shift edit on word level. Unlikethe strict matching criterion in TER, a hy-pothesis word is considered to match a refer-ence word and could be shifted, if the edit dis-\f68tance between them is below a threshold value.The Levenshtein distance between the refer-ence and the shifted hypothesis sequence iscomputed on the character level. In addition,the lengths of hypothesis sequences instead ofreference sequences are used for normalizingthe edit distance, which effectively countersthe issue that shorter translations normallyachieve lower TER.Similarly to other character-level metrics,CharacTER is generally applied to non-tokenized outputs and references, which alsoholds for this year’s submission with one ex-ception.This year tokenization was carriedout for en-ru hypotheses and references be-fore calculating the scores, since this results inlarge improvements in terms of correlations.For other language pairs, no tokenizer wasused for pre-processing.4.4EEDEED (Stanchev et al., 2019) is a character-based metric, which builds upon CDER. Itis defined as the minimum number of opera-tions of an extension to the conventional editdistance containing a “jump” operation. Theedit distance operations (insertions, deletionsand substitutions) are performed at the char-acter level and jumps are performed when ablank space is reached. Furthermore, the cov-erage of multiple characters in the hypothesisis penalised by the introduction of a coveragepenalty. The sum of the length of the refer-ence and the coverage penalty is used as thenormalisation term.4.5ESIMEnhanced Sequential Inference Model (ESIM;Chen et al., 2017; Mathur et al., 2019) is aneural model proposed for Natural LanguageInference that has been adapted for MT evalu-ation. It uses cross-sentence attention and sen-tence matching heuristics to generate a repre-sentation of the translation and the reference,which is fed to a feedforward regressor. Themetric is trained on singly-annotated DirectAssessment data that has been collected forevaluating WMT systems: all WMT 2018 to-English data for the to-English language pairs,and all WMT 2018 data for all other languagepairs.4.6hLEPORb_baseline,hLEPORa_baselineThe submitted metric hLEPOR_baseline isa metric based on the factor combination oflength penalty, precision, recall, and positiondifference penalty.The weighted harmonicmean is applied to group the factors togetherwith tunable weight parameters. The system-level score is calculated with the same formulabut with each factor weighted using weight es-timated at system-level and not at segment-level.In this submitted baseline version, hLE-POR_baseline was not tuned for each lan-guage pair separately but the default weightswere applied across all submitted languagepairs. Further improvements can be achievedby tuning the weights according to the devel-opment data, adding morphological informa-tion and applying n-gram factor scores intoit (e.g. part-of-speech, n-gram precision andn-gram recall that were added into LEPORin WMT13.).The basic model factors andfurther development with parameters settingwere described in the paper (Han et al., 2012)and (Han et al., 2013).Forsentence-levelscore,onlyhLE-PORa_baseline was submitted with scorescalculated as the weighted harmonic meanof all the designed factors using defaultparameters.Forsystem-levelscore,bothhLEPORa_baselineandhLE-PORb_baselineweresubmitted,wherehLEPORa_baselineisthetheaveragescore of all sentence-level scores, and hLE-PORb_baseline is calculated via the samesentence-level hLEPOR equation but replac-ing each factor value with its system-levelcounterpart.4.7Meteor++_2.0 (syntax),Meteor++_2.0 (syntax+copy)Meteor++2.0 (Guo and Hu, 2019) isa metric based on Meteor (Denkowski andLavie, 2014) that takes syntactic-level para-phrase knowledge into consideration, whereparaphrases may sometimes be skip-grams.i.e.(protect...from, protect...against).Asthe original Meteor-based metrics only payattentiontoconsecutivestringmatching,\f69they perform badly when reference-hypothesispairs contain skip n-gram paraphrases. Me-teor++ 2.0 extracts the knowledge from theParaphrase Database (PPDB; Bannard andCallison-Burch, 2005) and integrates it intoMeteor-based metrics.4.8PRePPReP (Yoshimura et al., 2019) is a method forfiltering pseudo-references to achieve a goodmatch with a gold reference.At the beginning, the source sentence istranslated with some off-the-shelf MT sys-tems to create a set of pseudo-references.(Here the MT systems were Google Translateand Microsoft Bing Translator.) The pseudo-references are then filtered using BERT (De-vlin et al., 2019) fine-tuned on the MPRCcorpus (Dolan and Brockett, 2005), estimat-ing the probability of the paraphrase betweengold reference and pseudo-references. Thanksto the high quality of the underlying MT sys-tems, a large portion of their outputs is indeedconsidered as a valid paraphrase.The final metric score is calculated sim-ply with SentBLEU with these multiple ref-erences.4.9WMDOWMDO (Chow et al., 2019b) is a metric basedon distance between distributions in the se-mantic vector space. Matching in the seman-tic space has been investigated for translationevaluation, but the constraints of a transla-tion’s word order have not been fully explored.Building on the Word Mover’s Distance metricand various word embeddings, WMDO intro-duces a fragmentation penalty to account forfluency of a translation. This word order ex-tension is shown to perform better than stan-dard WMD, with promising results againstother types of metrics.4.10YiSi-0, YiSi-1, YiSi-1_srl, YiSi-2,YiSi-2_srlYiSi (Lo, 2019) is a unified semantic MT qual-ity evaluation and estimation metric for lan-guages with different levels of available re-sources.YiSi-1 is a MT evaluation metric that mea-sures the semantic similarity between a ma-chine translation and human references byaggregating the idf-weighted lexical semanticsimilarities based on the contextual embed-dings extracted from BERT and optionally in-corporating shallow semantic structures (de-noted as YiSi-1_srl).YiSi-0 is the degenerate version of YiSi-1that is ready-to-deploy to any language.Ituses longest common character substring tomeasure the lexical similarity.YiSi-2 is the bilingual, reference-less versionfor MT quality estimation, which uses the con-textual embeddings extracted from BERT toevaluate the crosslingual lexical semantic simi-larity between the input and MT output. LikeYiSi-1, YiSi-2 can exploit shallow semanticstructures as well (denoted as YiSi-2_srl).4.11QE SystemsIn addition to the submitted standard metrics,10 quality estimation systems were submittedto the “QE as a Metric” track. The submittedQE systems are evaluated in the same settingsas metrics to facilitate comparison. Their de-scriptions can be found in the Findings of theWMT 2019 Shared Task on Quality Estima-tion (Fonseca et al., 2019).5ResultsWe discuss system-level results for news tasksystems in Section 5.1. The segment-level re-sults are in Section 5.2.5.1System-Level EvaluationAs in previous years, we employ the Pearsoncorrelation (r) as the main evaluation measurefor system-level metrics. The Pearson correla-tion is as follows:r =∑ni=1(Hi −H)(Mi −M)√∑ni=1(Hi −H)2√∑ni=1(Mi −M)2(1)where Hi are human assessment scores of allsystems in a given translation direction, Miare the corresponding scores as predicted bya given metric.H and M are their means,respectively.Since some metrics, such as BLEU, aim toachieve a strong positive correlation with hu-man assessment, while error metrics, such asTER, aim for a strong negative correlation wecompare metrics via the absolute value |r| of

ResultsTables 3, 4 and 5 provide the system-level cor-relations of metrics evaluating translation ofnewstest2019. The underlying texts are partof the WMT19 News Translation test set (new-stest2019) and the underlying MT systems areall MT systems participating in the WMT19News Translation Task.As recommended by Graham and Bald-win (2014), we employ Williams significancetest (Williams, 1959) to identify differencesin correlation that are statistically significant.Williams test is a test of significance of a dif-ference in dependent correlations and there-fore suitable for evaluation of metrics. Corre-lations not significantly outperformed by anyother metric for the given language pair arehighlighted in bold in Tables 3, 4 and 5.Since pairwise comparisons of metrics maybe also of interest, e.g. to learn which metricssignificantly outperform the most widely em-ployed metric BLEU, we include significancetest results for every competing pair of metricsincluding our baseline metrics in Figure 1 andFigure 2.This year, the increased number of systemsparticipating in the news tasks has provided alarger sample of system scores for testing met-rics.Since we already have sufficiently con-clusive results on genuine MT systems, we donot need to generate hybrid system results asin Graham and Liu (2016) and past metricstasks.5.2Segment-Level EvaluationSegment-level evaluation relies on the man-ual judgements collected in the News Trans-lation Task evaluation.This year, again wewere unable to follow the methodology out-lined in Graham et al. (2015) for evaluation ofsegment-level metrics because the sampling ofsentences did not provide sufficient number ofassessments of the same segment. We there-fore convert pairs of DA scores for compet-ing translations to daRR better/worse prefer-ences as described in Section 2.3.2.We measure the quality of metrics’ segment-level scores against the daRR golden truth us-ing a Kendall’s Tau-like formulation, which isan adaptation of the conventional Kendall’sTau coefficient.Since we do not have a to-tal order ranking of all translations, it is notpossible to apply conventional Kendall’s Tau(Graham et al., 2015).Our Kendall’s Tau-like formulation, τ, is asfollows:τ = |Concordant| −|Discordant||Concordant| + |Discordant|(2)where Concordant is the set of all human com-parisons for which a given metric suggests thesame order and Discordant is the set of allhuman comparisons for which a given metricdisagrees. The formula is not specific with re-spect to ties, i.e. cases where the annotationsays that the two outputs are equally good.The way in which ties (both in human andmetric judgement) were incorporated in com-puting Kendall τ has changed across the yearsof WMT Metrics Tasks. Here we adopt theversion used in WMT17 daRR evaluation.For a detailed discussion on other options, seealso Macháček and Bojar (2014).Whether or not a given comparison of a pairof distinct translations of the same source in-put, s1 and s2, is counted as a concordant(Conc) or disconcordant (Disc) pair is definedby the following matrix:Metrics1 < s2s1 = s2s1 > s2Humans1 < s2ConcDiscDiscs1 = s2−−−s1 > s2DiscDiscConcIn the notation of Macháček and Bojar(2014), this corresponds to the setup used inWMT12 (with a different underlying methodof manual judgements, RR):MetricWMT12<=>Human<1-1-1=XXX>-1-11The key differences between the evaluationused in WMT14–WMT16 and evaluation usedin WMT17–WMT19 were (1) the move fromRR to daRR and (2) the treatment of ties. Inthe years 2014-2016, ties in metrics scores werenot penalized.

It is now impor-tant to interpret the meaning of the compar-ison identically for humans and metrics. Forerror metrics, we thus reverse the sign of themetric score prior to the comparison with hu-man scores: higher scores have to indicate bet-ter translation quality. In WMT19, the origi-nal authors did this for CharacTER.To summarize, the WMT19 Metrics Taskfor segment-level evaluation:• ensures that error metrics are first con-verted to the same orientation as the hu-man judgements, i.e.higher score indi-cating higher translation quality,• excludes all human ties (this is alreadyimplied by the construction of daRRfrom DA judgements),\f77de-enfi-engu-enYiSi.1_srlESIMYiSi.1BERTrBEERchrF.chrFEEDYiSi.0CharacTERWMDOMeteor.._2.0.syntax.copy.Meteor.._2.0.syntax.YiSi.2YiSi.2_srlsentBLEUPRePUNIUNI.LASIMibm1.morphemeLPibm1.pos4gramibm1−pos4gramLPibm1−morphemeLASIMUNI+UNIPRePsentBLEUYiSi−2_srlYiSi−2Meteor++_2.0(syntax)Meteor++_2.0(syntax+copy)WMDOCharacTERYiSi−0EEDchrFchrF+BEERBERTrYiSi−1ESIMYiSi−1_srlYiSi.1YiSi.1_srlESIMBERTrchrF.chrFBEERWMDOEEDMeteor.._2.0.syntax.Meteor.._2.0.syntax.copy.YiSi.0CharacTERsentBLEUUNI.UNIPRePYiSi.2ibm1.morphemeibm1−morphemeYiSi−2PRePUNIUNI+sentBLEUCharacTERYiSi−0Meteor++_2.0(syntax+copy)Meteor++_2.0(syntax)EEDWMDOBEERchrFchrF+BERTrESIMYiSi−1_srlYiSi−1YiSi.1YiSi.1_srlESIMBERTrEEDYiSi.0WMDOBEERchrF.chrFMeteor.._2.0.syntax.copy.Meteor.._2.0.syntax.PRePCharacTERsentBLEUYiSi.2YiSi−2sentBLEUCharacTERPRePMeteor++_2.0(syntax)Meteor++_2.0(syntax+copy)chrFchrF+BEERWMDOYiSi−0EEDBERTrESIMYiSi−1_srlYiSi−1kk-enlt-enru-enYiSi.1_srlYiSi.1ESIMBERTrBEERWMDOYiSi.0Meteor.._2.0.syntax.copy.Meteor.._2.0.syntax.chrF.EEDchrFPRePsentBLEUhLEPORa_baselineCharacTERYiSi.2YiSi−2CharacTERhLEPORa_baselinesentBLEUPRePchrFEEDchrF+Meteor++_2.0(syntax)Meteor++_2.0(syntax+copy)YiSi−0WMDOBEERBERTrESIMYiSi−1YiSi−1_srlYiSi.1_srlYiSi.1ESIMBERTrBEERchrF.chrFWMDOEEDMeteor.._2.0.syntax.YiSi.0Meteor.._2.0.syntax.copy.sentBLEUCharacTERPRePYiSi.2ibm1.morphemeibm1−morphemeYiSi−2PRePCharacTERsentBLEUMeteor++_2.0(syntax+copy)YiSi−0Meteor++_2.0(syntax)EEDWMDOchrFchrF+BEERBERTrESIMYiSi−1YiSi−1_srlYiSi.1_srlYiSi.1ESIMBERTrBEERchrF.chrFYiSi.0EEDMeteor.._2.0.syntax.copy.WMDOMeteor.._2.0.syntax.CharacTERsentBLEUPRePUNI.UNIYiSi.2LASIMLPLPLASIMYiSi−2UNIUNI+PRePsentBLEUCharacTERMeteor++_2.0(syntax)WMDOMeteor++_2.0(syntax+copy)EEDYiSi−0chrFchrF+BEERBERTrESIMYiSi−1YiSi−1_srlzh-enen-csen-deYiSi.1_srlYiSi.1BERTrESIMEEDchrF.BEERchrFMeteor.._2.0.syntax.Meteor.._2.0.syntax.copy.WMDOYiSi.0hLEPORa_baselineCharacTERsentBLEUPRePYiSi.2YiSi.2_srlYiSi−2_srlYiSi−2PRePsentBLEUCharacTERhLEPORa_baselineYiSi−0WMDOMeteor++_2.0(syntax+copy)Meteor++_2.0(syntax)chrFBEERchrF+EEDESIMBERTrYiSi−1YiSi−1_srlYiSi.1chrF.chrFBEEREEDYiSi.0sentBLEUCharacTERYiSi.2UNIibm1.morphemeibm1−morphemeUNIYiSi−2CharacTERsentBLEUYiSi−0EEDBEERchrFchrF+YiSi−1YiSi.1_srlYiSi.1ESIMchrF.chrFBEEREEDYiSi.0CharacTERsentBLEUYiSi.2_srlYiSi.2LASIMUNIibm1.morphemeUSFDUSFD.TLLPibm1.pos4gramibm1−pos4gramLPUSFD−TLUSFDibm1−morphemeUNILASIMYiSi−2YiSi−2_srlsentBLEUCharacTERYiSi−0EEDBEERchrFchrF+ESIMYiSi−1YiSi−1_srlen-fien-guen-kkYiSi.1chrF.BEERchrFESIMEEDYiSi.0CharacTERsentBLEUUNIYiSi.2ibm1.morphemeibm1−morphemeYiSi−2UNIsentBLEUCharacTERYiSi−0EEDESIMchrFBEERchrF+YiSi−1EEDYiSi.1YiSi.0chrF.BEERchrFCharacTERsentBLEUhLEPORa_baselineYiSi.2YiSi−2hLEPORa_baselinesentBLEUCharacTERchrFBEERchrF+YiSi−0YiSi−1EEDYiSi.1EEDBEERESIMYiSi.0chrF.chrFsentBLEUhLEPORa_baselineCharacTERYiSi.2YiSi−2CharacTERhLEPORa_baselinesentBLEUchrFchrF+YiSi−0ESIMBEEREEDYiSi−1en-lten-ruen-zhYiSi.1chrF.chrFBEERESIMEEDYiSi.0sentBLEUCharacTERYiSi.2ibm1.morphemeibm1−morphemeYiSi−2CharacTERsentBLEUYiSi−0EEDESIMBEERchrFchrF+YiSi−1YiSi.1ESIMEEDchrF.BEERchrFYiSi.0sentBLEUCharacTERUNIUNI.USFD.TLUSFDYiSi.2LPLASIMLASIMLPYiSi−2USFDUSFD−TLUNI+UNICharacTERsentBLEUYiSi−0chrFBEERchrF+EEDESIMYiSi−1YiSi.1_srlYiSi.1ESIMchrFchrF.sentBLEUYiSi.0EEDBEERCharacTERYiSi.2YiSi.2_srlYiSi−2_srlYiSi−2CharacTERBEEREEDYiSi−0sentBLEUchrF+chrFESIMYiSi−1YiSi−1_srlFigure 3: daRR segment-level metric significance test results for into English and out-of English languagepairs (newstest2019): Green cells denote a significant win for the metric in a given row over the metricin a given column according bootstrap resampling.\f78de-csde-frfr-deYiSi.1EEDBEERESIMYiSi.0chrF.chrFCharacTERhLEPORa_baselinesentBLEUYiSi.2ibm1.morphemeibm1−morphemeYiSi−2sentBLEUhLEPORa_baselineCharacTERchrFchrF+YiSi−0ESIMBEEREEDYiSi−1YiSi.1EEDYiSi.0BEERESIMchrF.chrFCharacTERhLEPORa_baselinesentBLEUYiSi.2ibm1.morphemeibm1.pos4gramibm1−pos4gramibm1−morphemeYiSi−2sentBLEUhLEPORa_baselineCharacTERchrFchrF+ESIMBEERYiSi−0EEDYiSi−1YiSi.1YiSi.1_srlESIMchrF.YiSi.0chrFEEDBEERCharacTERsentBLEUYiSi.2ibm1.morphemeibm1.pos4gramibm1−pos4gramibm1−morphemeYiSi−2sentBLEUCharacTERBEEREEDchrFYiSi−0chrF+ESIMYiSi−1_srlYiSi−1Figure 4: daRR segment-level metric significance test results for German to Czech, German to Frenchand French to German (newstest2019): Green cells denote a significant win for the metric in a given rowover the metric in a given column according bootstrap resampling.• counts metric’s ties as a Discordant pairs.We employ bootstrap resampling (Koehn,2004; Graham et al., 2014b) to estimate con-fidence intervals for our Kendall’s Tau for-mulation, and metrics with non-overlapping95% confidence intervals are identified as hav-ing statistically significant difference in perfor-mance.5.2.1Segment-Level ResultsResults of the segment-level human evaluationfor translations sampled from the News Trans-lation Task are shown in Tables 6, 7 and 8,where metric correlations not significantly out-performed by any other metric are highlightedin bold. Head-to-head significance test resultsfor differences in metric performance are in-cluded in Figures 3 and 4.6DiscussionThis year, human data was collected fromreference-basedevaluations(or“monolin-gual”)andreference-freeevaluations(or“bilingual”).The reference-based (mono-lingual) evaluations were obtained with thehelpofanonymouscrowdsourcing,whilethe reference-less (bilingual) evaluations weremainly from MT researchers who committedtheir time contribution to the manual evalua-tion for each submitted system.6.1Stability across MT SystemsThe observed performance of metrics dependson the underlying texts and systems that par-ticipate in the News Translation Task (see Sec-tion 2). For the strongest MT systems, distin-guishing which system outputs are better is468101214161820sacreBLEU-BLEUFigure 5: Pearson correlations of sacreBLEU-BLEU for English-German system-level evalua-tion for all systems (left) down to only top 4 sys-tems (right). The y-axis spans from -1 to +1, base-line metrics for the language pair in grey.hard, even for human assessors. On the otherhand, if the systems are spread across a wideperformance range, it will be easier for metricsto correlate with human judgements.To provide a more reliable view, we createdplots of Pearson correlation when the under-lying set of MT systems is reduced to top nones. One sample such plot is in Figure 5, alllanguage pairs and most of the metrics are inAppendix A.As the plot documents, the official correla-tions reported in Tables 3 to 5 can lead towrong conclusions. sacreBLEU-BLEU cor-relates at .969 when all systems are considered,but as we start considering only the top n sys-tems, the correlation falls relatively quickly.With 10 systems, we are below .5 and whenonly the top 6 or 4 systems are considered,the correlation falls even to the negave val-ues.Note that correlations point estimates(the value in the y-axis) become noiser withthe decreasing number of the underlying MTsystems.Figure 6 explains the situation and illus-\f79 0.15 0.2 0.25 0.3 0.35 0.4 0.45 0.5-2-1.5-1-0.5 0 0.5SacreBLEU-BLEUDATop 4Top 6Top 8Top 10Top 12Top 15All systemsFigure 6trates the sensitivity of the observed correla-tions to the exact set of systems. On the fullset of systems, the single outlier (the worst-performing system called en_de_task) helpsto achieve a great positive correlation.Themajority of MT systems however form a cloudwith Pearson correlation around .5 and the top4 systems actually exhibit a negative corre-lation of the human score and sacreBLEU-BLEU.In Appendix A, baseline metrics are plottedin grey in all the plots, so that their trends canbe observed jointly. In general, most baselineshave similar correlations, as most baselines usesimilar features (n-gram or word-level features,with the exception of chrF). In a number oflanguage pairs (de-en, de-fr, en-de, en-kk, lt-en, ru-en, zh-en), baseline correlations tend to-wards 0 (no correlation) or even negative Pear-son correlation. For a widely applied metricsuch as sacreBLEU-BLEU, our analysis re-veals weak correlation in comparing top state-of-the-art systems in these language pairs, es-pecially in en-de, de-en, ru-en, and zh-en.We will restrict our analysis to those lan-guage pairs where the baseline metrics have anobvious downward trend (de-en, de-fr, en-de,en-kk, lt-en, ru-en, zh-en). Examining the top-n correlation in the submitted metrics (not in-cluding QE systems), most metrics show thesame degredation in correlation as the base-lines. We note BERTr as the one exceptionconsistently degrading less and retaining pos-itive correlation compared to other submittedmetrics and baselines, in the language pairswhere it participated.For QE systems, we noticed that in some in-stances, QE systems have upward correlationtrends when other metrics and baselines havedownward trends. For instance, LP, UNI, andUNI+ in the de-en language pair, YiSi-2 inen-kk, and UNI and UNI+ in ru-en. Theseresults suggest that QE systems such as UNIand UNI+ perform worse on judging systemsof wide ranging quality, but better for top per-forming systems, or perhaps for systems closerin quality.If our method of human assessment is sound,we should believe that BLEU, a widely ap-plied metric, is no longer a reliable metric forjudging our best systems.Future investiga-tions are needed to understand when BLEUapplies well, and why BLEU is not effectivefor output from our state of the art models.Metrics and QE systems such as BERTr,ESIM, YiSi that perform well at judgingour best systems often use more semanticfeatures compared to our n-gram/char-grambased baselines. Future metrics may want toexplore a) whether semantic features such ascontextual word embeddings are achieving se-mantic understanding and b) whether seman-tic understanding is the true source of a met-ric’s performance gains.It should be noted that some language pairsdo not show the strong degrading pattern withtop-n systems this year, for instance en-cs, en-gu, en-ru, or kk-en. English-Chinese is partic-ularly interesting because we see a clear trendtowards better correlations as we reduce theset of underlying systems to the top scoringones.6.2Overall Metric Performance6.2.1System-Level EvaluationIn system-level evaluation, the series of YiSimetrics achieve the highest correlations in sev-eral language pairs and it is not significantlyoutperformed by any other metrics (denotedas a “win” in the following) for almost all lan-guage pairs.The new metric ESIM performs best on 5language languages (18 language pairs) andobtains 11 “wins” out of 16 language pairs inwhich ESIM participated.The metric EED performs better for lan-guage pairs out-of English and excluding En-\f80glish compared to into-English language pairs,achieving 7 out of 11 “wins” there.6.2.2Segment-Level EvaluationFor segment-level evaluation, most languagepairs are quite discerning, with only one ortwo metrics taking the “winner” position (ofnot being significantly surpassed by others).Only French-German differs, with all metricsperforming similarly except the significantlyworse sentBLEU.YiSi-1_srl stands out as the “winner” forall language pairs in which it participated.The excluded language pairs were probablydue to the lack of semantic information re-quired by YiSi-1_srl.YiSi-1 participatedall language pairs and its correlations are com-parable with those of YiSi-1_srl.ESIM obtain 6 “winners” out of all 18 lan-guages pairs.Both YiSi and ESIM are based on neu-ral networks (YiSi via word and phrase em-beddings, as well as other types of availableresources, ESIM via sentence embeddings).This is a confirmation of a trend observed lastyear.6.2.3QE Systems as MetricsGenerally,correlationsforthestandardreference-based metrics are obviously betterthan those in “QE as a Metric” track, bothwhen using monolingual and bilingual goldentruth.In system-level evaluation, correlations for“QE as a Metric” range from 0.028 to 0.947across all language pairs and all metrics butthey are very unstable.Even for a singlemetric, take UNI for example, the correla-tions range from 0.028 to 0.930 across languagepairs.In segment-level evaluation, correlations forQE metrics range from -0.153 to 0.351 acrossall language pairs and show the same instabil-ity across language pairs for a given metric.In either case, we do not see any patternthat could explain the behaviour, e.g. whetherthe manual evaluation was monolingual orbilingual, or the characteristics of the givenlanguage pair.6.3Dependence on ImplementationAs it already happened in the past, we hadmultiple implementations for some metrics,BLEU and chrF in particular.The detailed configuration of BLEU andsacreBLEU-BLEU differ and hence theirscores and correlation results are different.chrF and sacreBLEU-chrF use the sameparameters and should thus deliver the samescores but we still observe some differences,leading to different correlations. For instancefor German-French Pearson correlation, chrFobtains 0.931 (no win) but sacreBLEU-chrF reaches 0.952, tying for a win with othermetrics.We thus fully support the call for clarity byPost (2018b) and invite authors of metrics toinclude their implementations either in Mosesscorer or sacreBLEU to achieve a long-termassessment of their metric.7ConclusionThis paper summarizes the results of WMT19shared task in machine translation evaluation,the Metrics Shared Task. Participating met-rics were evaluated in terms of their correla-tion with human judgement at the level ofthe whole test set (system-level evaluation),as well as at the level of individual sentences(segment-level evaluation).We reported scores for standard metrics re-quiring the reference as well as quality estima-tion systems which took part in the track “QEas a metric”, joint with the Quality Estimationtask.For system-level, best metrics reach over0.95 Pearson correlation or better across sev-eral language pairs.As expected, QE sys-tems are visibly in all language pairs but theycan also reach high system-level correlations,up to .947 (Chinese-English) or .936 (English-German) by YiSi-1_srl or over .9 for multi-ple language pairs by UNI.An important caveat is that the correlationsare heavily affected by the underlying set ofMT systems.We explored this by reducingthe set of systems to top-n ones for various nsand found out that for many language pairs,system-level correlations are much worse whenbased on only the better performing systems.With both good and bad MT systems partic-\f81ipating in the news task, the metrics resultscan be overly optimistic compared to what weget when evaluating state-of-the-art systems.In terms of segment-level Kendall’s τ re-sults, the standard metrics correlations variedbetween 0.03 and 0.59, and QE systems ob-tained even negative correlations.The results confirm the observation from thelast year, namely metrics based on word orsentence-level embeddings (YiSi and ESIM),achieve the highest performance.AcknowledgmentsResults in this shared task would not be pos-sible without tight collaboration with organiz-ers of the WMT News Translation Task.

We cre-ate SCIERC, a dataset that includes annota-tions for all three tasks and develop a uni-ﬁed framework called Scientiﬁc InformationExtractor (SCIIE) for with shared span rep-resentations.The multi-task setup reducescascading errors between tasks and leveragescross-sentence relations through coreferencelinks. Experiments show that our multi-taskmodel outperforms previous models in scien-tiﬁc information extraction without using anydomain-speciﬁc features. We further show thatthe framework supports construction of a sci-entiﬁc knowledge graph, which we use to ana-lyze information in scientiﬁc literature.11IntroductionAs scientiﬁc communities grow and evolve, newtasks, methods, and datasets are introduced anddifferent methods are compared with each other.Despite advances in search engines, it is still hardto identify new technologies and their relationshipswith what existed before. To help researchers morequickly identify opportunities for new combina-tions of tasks, methods and data, it is important todesign intelligent algorithms that can extract andorganize scientiﬁc information from a large collec-tion of documents.Organizing scientiﬁc information into structuredknowledge bases requires information extraction(IE) about scientiﬁc entities and their relationships.However, the challenges associated with scientiﬁcIE are greater than for a general domain. First, an-notation of scientiﬁc text requires domain expertisewhich makes annotation costly and limits resources.1Data and code are publicly available at: http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/sciIE/Figure 1: Example annotation: phrases that refer tothe same scientiﬁc concept are annotated into thesame coreference cluster, such as MORphologicalPAser MORPA, it and MORPA (marked as red).In addition, most relation extraction systems are de-signed for within-sentence relations. However, ex-tracting information from scientiﬁc articles requiresextracting relations across sentences. Figure 1 il-lustrates this problem. The cross-sentence relationsbetween some entities can only be connected byentities that refer to the same scientiﬁc concept,including generic terms (such as the pronoun it,or phrases like our method) that are not informa-tive by themselves. With co-reference, context-freegrammar can be connected to MORPA through theintermediate co-referred pronoun it. Applying ex-isting IE systems to this data, without co-reference,will result in much lower relation coverage (and asparse knowledge base).In this paper, we develop a uniﬁed learningmodel for extracting scientiﬁc entities, relations,and coreference resolution. This is different fromprevious work (Luan et al., 2017b; Gupta and Man-ning, 2011; Tsai et al., 2013; G´abor et al., 2018)which often addresses these tasks as independent\f3220components of a pipeline. Our uniﬁed model isa multi-task setup that shares parameters acrosslow-level tasks, making predictions by leveragingcontext across the document through coreferencelinks. Speciﬁcally, we extend prior work for learn-ing span representations and coreference resolution(Lee et al., 2017; He et al., 2018). Different from astandard tagging system, our system enumerates allpossible spans during decoding and can effectivelydetect overlapped spans. It avoids cascading errorsbetween tasks by jointly modeling all spans andspan-span relations.To explore this problem, we create a dataset SCI-ERC for scientiﬁc information extraction, whichincludes annotations of scientiﬁc terms, relationcategories and co-reference links. Our experimentsshow that the uniﬁed model is better at predict-ing span boundaries, and it outperforms previousstate-of-the-art scientiﬁc IE systems on entity andrelation extraction (Luan et al., 2017b; Augensteinet al., 2017). In addition, we build a scientiﬁcknowledge graph integrating terms and relationsextracted from each article. Human evaluationshows that propagating coreference can signiﬁ-cantly improve the quality of the automatic con-structed knowledge graph.In summary we make the following contribu-tions. We create a dataset for scientiﬁc informationextraction by jointly annotating scientiﬁc entities,relations, and coreference links. Extending a previ-ous end-to-end coreference resolution system, wedevelop a multi-task learning framework that candetect scientiﬁc entities, relations, and coreferenceclusters without hand-engineered features. We useour uniﬁed framework to build a scientiﬁc knowl-edge graph from a large collection of documentsand analyze information in scientiﬁc literature.2Related WorkThere has been growing interest in research on au-tomatic methods for information extraction fromscientiﬁc articles. Past research in scientiﬁc IEaddressed analyzing citations (Athar and Teufel,2012b,a; Kas, 2011; Gabor et al., 2016; Sim et al.,2012; Do et al., 2013; Jaidka et al., 2014; Abu-Jbara and Radev, 2011), analyzing research com-munity (Vogel and Jurafsky, 2012; Anderson et al.,2012), and unsupervised methods for extracting sci-entiﬁc entities and relations (Gupta and Manning,2011; Tsai et al., 2013; G´abor et al., 2016).More recently, two datasets in SemEval 2017and 2018 have been introduced, which facilitateresearch on supervised and semi-supervised learn-ing for scientiﬁc information extraction. SemEval17 (Augenstein et al., 2017) includes 500 para-graphs from articles in the domains of computerscience, physics, and material science. It includesthree types of entities (called keyphrases): Tasks,Methods, and Materials and two relation types:hyponym-of and synonym-of. SemEval 18 (G´aboret al., 2018) is focused on predicting relations be-tween entities within a sentence. It consists of sixrelation types. Using these datasets, neural mod-els (Ammar et al., 2017, 2018; Luan et al., 2017b;Augenstein and Søgaard, 2017) are introduced forextracting scientiﬁc information. We extend thesedatasets by increasing relation coverage, addingcross-sentence coreference linking, and removingsome annotation constraints. Different from mostprevious IE systems for scientiﬁc literature and gen-eral domains (Miwa and Bansal, 2016; Xu et al.,2016; Peng et al., 2017; Quirk and Poon, 2017;Luan et al., 2018; Adel and Sch¨utze, 2017), whichuse preprocessed syntactic, discourse or corefer-ence features as input, our uniﬁed framework doesnot rely on any pipeline processing and is able tomodel overlapping spans.While Singh et al. (2013) show improvementsby jointly modeling entities, relations, and coref-erence links, most recent neural models for thesetasks focus on single tasks (Clark and Manning,2016; Wiseman et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017; Lam-ple et al., 2016; Peng et al., 2017) or joint entityand relation extraction (Katiyar and Cardie, 2017;Zhang et al., 2017; Adel and Sch¨utze, 2017; Zhenget al., 2017). Among those studies, many papers as-sume the entity boundaries are given, such as (Clarkand Manning, 2016), Adel and Sch¨utze (2017) andPeng et al. (2017). Our work relaxes this constraintand predicts entity boundaries by optimizing overall possible spans. Our model draws from recentend-to-end span-based models for coreference res-olution (Lee et al., 2017, 2018) and semantic rolelabeling (He et al., 2018) and extends them for themulti-task framework involving the three tasks ofidentiﬁcation of entity, relation and coreference.Neural multi-task learning has been applied toa range of NLP tasks. Most of these models shareword-level representations (Collobert and Weston,2008; Klerke et al., 2016; Luan et al., 2016, 2017a;Rei, 2017), while Peng et al. (2017) uses high-ordercross-task factors. Our model instead propagates\f3221cross-task information via span representations,which is related to Swayamdipta et al. (2017).3DatasetOur dataset (called SCIERC) includes annotationsfor scientiﬁc entities, their relations, and corefer-ence clusters for 500 scientiﬁc abstracts. These ab-stracts are taken from 12 AI conference/workshopproceedings in four AI communities from the Se-mantic Scholar Corpus2. SCIERC extends pre-vious datasets in scientiﬁc articles SemEval 2017Task 10 (SemEval 17) (Augenstein et al., 2017) andSemEval 2018 Task 7 (SemEval 18) (G´abor et al.,2018) by extending entity types, relation types, rela-tion coverage, and adding cross-sentence relationsusing coreference links. Our dataset is publiclyavailable at: http://nlp.cs.washington.edu/sciIE/. Table 1 shows the statistics of SCI-ERC.Annotation SchemeWe deﬁne six types for an-notating scientiﬁc entities (Task, Method, Metric,Material, Other-ScientiﬁcTerm and Generic) andseven relation types (Compare, Part-of, Conjunc-tion, Evaluate-for, Feature-of, Used-for, Hyponym-Of). Directionality is taken into account exceptfor the two symmetric relation types (Conjunctionand Compare). Coreference links are annotatedbetween identical scientiﬁc entities. A Generic en-tity is annotated only when the entity is involvedin a relation or is coreferred with another entity.Annotation guidelines can be found in Appendix A.Figure 1 shows an annotated example.Following annotation guidelines from Qasem-iZadeh and Schumann (2016) and using the BRATinterface (Stenetorp et al., 2012), our annotatorsperform a greedy annotation for spans and alwaysprefer the longer span whenever ambiguity occurs.Nested spans are allowed when a subspan has arelation/coreference link with another term outsidethe span.Human AgreementsOne domain expert anno-tated all the documents in the dataset; 12% of thedata is dually annotated by 4 other domain expertsto evaluate the user agreements. The kappa scorefor annotating entities is 76.9%, relation extractionis 67.8% and coreference is 63.8%.2These conferences include general AI (AAAI, IJCAI),NLP (ACL, EMNLP, IJCNLP), speech (ICASSP, Interspeech),machine learning (NIPS, ICML), and computer vision (CVPR,ICCV, ECCV) at http://labs.semanticscholar.org/corpus/StatisticsSCIERCSemEval 17SemEval 18#Entities808999467483#Relations47166721595#Relations/Doc9.41.33.2#Coref links2752--#Coref clusters1023--Table 1: Dataset statistics for our dataset SCIERCand two previous datasets on scientiﬁc informationextraction. All datasets annotate 500 documents.Comparison with previous datasetsSCIERCis focused on annotating cross-sentence relationsand has more relation coverage than SemEval 17and SemEval 18, as shown in Table 1. SemEval 17is mostly designed for entity recognition and onlycovers two relation types. The task in SemEval 18is to classify a relation between a pair of entitiesgiven entity boundaries, but only intra-sentence re-lations are annotated and each entity only appearsin one relation, resulting in sparser relation cover-age than our dataset (3.2 vs. 9.4 relations per ab-stract). SCIERC extends these datasets by addingmore relation types and coreference clusters, whichallows representing cross-sentence relations, andremoving annotation constraints. Table 1 gives acomparison of statistics among the three datasets.In addition, SCIERC aims at including broadercoverage of general AI communities.4ModelWe develop a uniﬁed framework (called SCIIE)to identify and classify scientiﬁc entities, relations,and coreference resolution across sentences. SCIIEis a multi-task learning setup that extends previousspan-based models for coreference resolution (Leeet al., 2017) and semantic role labeling (He et al.,2018). All three tasks of entity recognition, re-lation extraction, and coreference resolution aretreated as multinomial classiﬁcation problems withshared span representations. SCIIE beneﬁts fromexpressive contextualized span representations asclassiﬁer features. By sharing span representations,sentence-level tasks can beneﬁt from informationpropagated from coreference resolution across sen-tences, without increasing the complexity of infer-ence. Figure 2 shows a high-level overview of theSCIIE multi-task framework.4.1Problem DeﬁnitionThe input is a document represented as a sequenceof words D = {w1, . . . , wn}, from which we de-rive S = {s1, . . . , sN}, the set of all possible\f3222MORPAMORPA is aa fully implemented parserparserMORphological Parser MORPAMORPA is a fully implemented parser developed for ……, the MORphological Parser MORPA is provided with a …MORphologicalMORPA isis provided withNULLHyponym-ofUsed-forNULLMethodTaskNULLSentencesBiLSTM outputsSpan  RepresentationsEntity Recognition+Span FeaturesCoreference ResolutionRelation Extraction……parserMORPAMORphologicalMORphological Parser MORPA………Figure 2: Overview of the multitask setup, where all three tasks are treated as classiﬁcation problems ontop of shared span representations. Dotted arcs indicate the normalization space for each task.within-sentence word sequence spans (up to a rea-sonable length) in the document. The output con-tains three structures: the entity types E for allspans S, the relations R for all pair of spans S × S,and the coreference links C for all spans in S. Theoutput structures are represented with a set of dis-crete random variables indexed by spans or pairsof spans. Speciﬁcally, the output structures aredeﬁned as follows.Entity recognition is to predict the best entity typefor every candidate span. Let LE represent the setof all possible entity types including the null-type ϵ.The output structure E is a set of random variablesindexed by spans: ei ∈LE for i = 1, . . . , N.Relation extraction is to predict the best relationtype given an ordered pair of spans (si, sj). Let LRbe the set of all possible relation types includingthe null-type ϵ. The output structure R is a set ofrandom variables indexed over pairs of spans (i, j)that belong to the same sentence: rij ∈LR fori, j = 1, . . . , N.Coreference resolution is to predict the best an-tecedent (including a special null antecedent) givena span, which is the same mention-ranking modelused in Lee et al. (2017). The output structureC is a set of random variables deﬁned as: ci ∈{1, . . . , i −1, ϵ} for i = 1, . . . , N.4.2Model DeﬁnitionWe formulate the multi-task learning setup aslearning the conditional probability distributionP(E, R, C|D). For efﬁcient training and inference,we decompose P(E, R, C|D) assuming spans areconditionally independent given D:P(E, R, C | D) = P(E, R, C, S | D)(1)=NYi=1P(ei | D)P(ci | D)NYj=1P(rij | D),where the conditional probabilities of each randomvariable are independently normalized:P(ei = e | D) =exp(ΦE(e, si))Pe′∈LE exp(ΦE(e′, si))(2)P(rij = r | D) =exp(ΦR(r, si, sj))Pr′∈LR exp(ΦR(r′, si, sj))P(ci = j | D) =exp(ΦC(si, sj))Pj′∈{1,...,i−1,ϵ} exp(ΦC(si, sj′)),where ΦE denotes the unnormalized model scorefor an entity type e and a span si, ΦR denotes thescore for a relation type r and span pairs si, sj,and ΦC denotes the score for a binary coreferencelink between si and sj. These Φ scores are furtherdecomposed into span and pairwise span scorescomputed from feed-forward networks, as will beexplained in Section 4.3.For simplicity, we omit D from the Φ functionsand S from the observation.ObjectiveGiven a set of all documents D, themodel loss function is deﬁned as a weighted sum ofthe negative log-likelihood loss of all three tasks:−X(D,R∗,E∗,C∗)∈DnλE log P(E∗| D)(3)+ λR log P(R∗| D) + λC log P(C∗| D)o\f3223where E∗, R∗, and C∗are gold structures of the en-tity types, relations, and coreference, respectively.The task weights λE, λR, and λC are introduced ashyper-parameters to control the importance of eachtask.For entity recognition and relation extraction,P(E∗| D) and P(R∗| D) are computed withthe deﬁnition in Equation (2). For coreferenceresolution, we use the marginalized loss follow-ing Lee et al. (2017) since each mention can havemultiple correct antecedents. Let C∗i be the setof all correct antecedents for span i, we have:log P(C∗| D) = Pi=1..N log Pc∈C∗i P(c | D).4.3Scoring ArchitectureWe use feedforward neural networks (FFNNs) overshared span representations g to compute a setof span and pairwise span scores. For the spanscores, φe(si) measures how likely a span si hasan entity type e, and φmr(si) and φmc(si) measurehow likely a span si is a mention in a relation or acoreference link, respectively. The pairwise scoresφr(si, sj) and φc(si, sj) measure how likely twospans are associated in a relation r or a coreferencelink, respectively. Let gi be the ﬁxed-length vec-tor representation for span si. For different tasks,the span scores φx(si) for x ∈{e, mc, mr} andpairwise span scores φy(si, sj) for y ∈{r, c} arecomputed as follows:φx(si) =wx · FFNNx(gi)φy(si, sj) =wy · FFNNy([gi, gj, gi ⊙gj]),where ⊙is element-wise multiplication, and{wx, wy} are neural network parameters to belearned.We use these scores to compute the different Φ:ΦE(e, si)=φe(si)(4)ΦR(r, si, sj)=φmr(si) + φmr(sj) + φr(si, sj)ΦC(si, sj)=φmc(si) + φmc(sj) + φc(si, sj)The scores in Equation (4) are deﬁned for entitytypes, relations, and antecedents that are not thenull-type ϵ. Scores involving the null label areset to a constant 0: ΦE(ϵ, si) = ΦR(ϵ, si, sj) =ΦC(si, ϵ) = 0.We use the same span representations g from(Lee et al., 2017) and share them across the threetasks. We start by building bi-directional LSTMs(Hochreiter and Schmidhuber, 1997) from word,character and ELMo (Peters et al., 2018) embed-dings.For a span si, its vector representation gi is con-structed by concatenating si’s left and right endpoints from the BiLSTM outputs, an attention-based soft “headword,” and embedded span widthfeatures. Hyperparameters and other implementa-tion details will be described in Section 6.4.4Inference and PruningFollowing previous work, we use beam pruning toreduce the number of pairwise span factors fromO(n4) to O(n2) at both training and test time,where n is the number of words in the document.We deﬁne two separate beams: BC to prune spansfor the coreference resolution task, and BR for rela-tion extraction. The spans in the beams are sortedby their span scores φmc and φmr respectively, andthe sizes of the beams are limited by λCn and λRn.We also limit the maximum width of spans to aﬁxed number W, which further reduces the num-ber of span factors to O(n).5Knowledge Graph ConstructionWe construct a scientiﬁc knowledge graph froma large corpus of scientiﬁc articles. The corpusincludes all abstracts (110k in total) from 12 AIconference proceedings from the Semantic ScholarCorpus. Nodes in the knowledge graph correspondto scientiﬁc entities. Edges correspond to scientiﬁcrelations between pairs of entities. The edges aretyped according to the relation types deﬁned in Sec-tion 3. Figure 4 shows a part of a knowledge graphcreated by our method. For example, StatisticalMachine Translation (SMT) and grammatical errorcorrection are nodes in the graph, and they are con-nected through a Used-for relation type. In orderto construct the knowledge graph for the wholecorpus, we ﬁrst apply the SCIIE model over sin-gle documents and then integrate the entities andrelations across multiple documents (Figure 3).Extracting nodes (entities)The SCIIE modelextracts entities, their relations, and coreferenceAbstract(1)Abstract(2)Abstract(m). . .. . .. . .Document-level KGsScientiﬁc KGMergingSciIESciIESciIEFigure 3: Knowledge graph construction process.\f3224Figure 4: A part of an automatically constructedscientiﬁc knowledge graph with the most frequentneighbors of the scientiﬁc term statistical machinetranslation (SMT) on the graph.

In particular, welink all entities that belong to the same coreferencecluster to replace generic terms with any other non-generic term in the cluster. Moreover, we replaceall the entities in the cluster with the entity that hasthe longest string. Our qualitative analysis showsthat there are fewer ambiguous phrases using coref-erence links (Figure 5). We calculate the frequencycounts of all entities that appear in the whole cor-pus. We assign nodes in the knowledge graph byselecting the most frequent entities (with counts> k) in the corpus, and merge in any remainingentities for which a frequent entity is a substring.Assigning edges (relations)A pair of entitiesmay appear in different contexts, resulting in differ-ent relation types between those entities (Figure 6).For every pair of entities in the graph, we calculatethe frequency of different relation types across thewhole corpus.We assign edges between entities byselecting the most frequent relation type.6Experimental SetupWe evaluate our uniﬁed framework SCIIE on SCI-ERC and SemEval 17.

We use the most frequent relation betweenpairs of entities in the knowledge graph.scientiﬁc community analysis is built using the Se-mantic Scholar Corpus (110k abstracts in total).6.1BaselinesWe compare our model with the following base-lines on SCIERCdataset:• LSTM+CRF The state-of-the-art NER sys-tem (Lample et al., 2016), which applies CRFon top of LSTM for named entity tagging, theapproach has also been used in scientiﬁc termextraction (Luan et al., 2017b).• LSTM+CRF+ELMoLSTM+CRFwithELMO as an additional input feature.• E2E Rel State-of-the-art joint entity and re-lation extraction system (Miwa and Bansal,2016) that has also been used in scientiﬁc lit-erature (Peters et al., 2017; Augenstein et al.,2017). This system uses syntactic featuressuch as part-of-speech tagging and depen-dency parsing.\f3225• E2E Rel(Pipeline) Pipeline setting of E2ERel. Extract entities ﬁrst and use entity resultsas input to relation extraction task.• E2E Rel+ELMo E2E Rel with ELMO as anadditional input feature.• E2E Coref State-of-the-art coreference sys-tem Lee et al. (2017) combined with ELMO.Our system SCIIE extends E2E Coref withmulti-task learning.In the SemEval task, we compare our modelSCIIE with the best reported system in the SemEvalleaderboard (Peters et al., 2017), which extendsE2E Rel with several in-domain features such asgazetteers extracted from existing knowledge basesand model ensembles. We also compare with thestate of the art on keyphrase extraction (Luan et al.,2017b), which applies semi-supervised methods toa neural tagging model.36.2Implementation detailsOur system extends the implementation and hyper-parameters from Lee et al. (2017) with the follow-ing adjustments. We use a 1 layer BiLSTM with200-dimensional hidden layers. All the FFNNshave 2 hidden layers of 150 dimensions each. Weuse 0.4 variational dropout (Gal and Ghahramani,2016) for the LSTMs, 0.4 dropout for the FFNNs,and 0.5 dropout for the input embeddings. Wemodel spans up to 8 words. For beam pruning,we use λC = 0.3 for coreference resolution andλR = 0.4 for relation extraction. For constructingthe knowledge graph, we use the following heuris-tics to normalize the entity phrases. We replace allacronyms with their corresponding full name andnormalize all the plural terms with their singularcounterparts.7Experimental ResultsWe evaluate SCIIE on SCIERC and SemEval 17datasets. We provide qualitative results and humanevaluation of the constructed knowledge graph.7.1IE ResultsResults on SciERCTable 2 compares the resultof our model with baselines on the three tasks: en-tity recognition (Table 2a), relation extraction (Ta-ble 2b), and coreference resolution (Table 2c).

For entityrecognition, our model achieves 1.3% and 2.4%relative improvement over LSTM+CRF with andwithout ELMO, respectively. Moreover, it achieves1.8% and 2.7% relative improvement over E2E Relwith and without ELMO, respectively. For rela-tion extraction, we observe more signiﬁcant im-provement with 13.1% relative improvement overE2E Rel and 7.4% improvement over E2E Rel withELMO. For coreference resolution, SCIIE outper-forms E2E Coref with 4.5% relative improvement.We still observe a large gap between human-levelperformance and a machine learning system. Weinvite the community to address this challengingtask.AblationsWe evaluate the effect of multi-tasklearning in each of the three tasks deﬁned in ourdataset. Table 3 reports the results for individualtasks when additional tasks are included in thelearning objective function. We observe that per-formance improves with each added task in theobjective. For example, Entity recognition (65.7)beneﬁts from both coreference resolution (67.5)and relation extraction (66.8).Relation extrac-\f3226TaskEntity Rec.RelationCoref.Multi Task (SCIIE)68.139.558.0Single Task65.737.955.3+Entity Rec.-38.957.1+Relation66.8-57.6+Coreference67.539.5-Table 3: Ablation study for multitask learning onSCIERC development set.

Span identiﬁcation aims atidentifying spans of entities. Keyphrase classiﬁ-cation and relation extraction has the same settingwith the entity and relation extraction in SCIERC.Our model outperforms all the previous modelsthat use hand-designed features. We observe moresigniﬁcant improvement in span identiﬁcation thankeyphrase classiﬁcation. This conﬁrms the bene-ﬁt of our model in enumerating spans (rather thanBIO tagging in state-of-the-art systems). More-over, we have competitive results compared to theprevious state of the art in relation extraction. Weobserve less gain compared to the SCIERC datasetmainly because there are no coference links, andthe relation types are not comprehensive.7.2Knowledge Graph AnalysisWe provide qualitative analysis and human evalua-tions on the constructed knowledge graph.Scientiﬁc trend analysisFigure 7 shows the his-torical trend analysis (from 1996 to 2016) of themost popular applications of the phrase neural net-work, selected according to the statistics of theextracted relation triples with the ‘Used-for’ rela-tion type from speech, computer vision, and NLPconference papers. We observe that, before 2000,neural network has been applied to a greater per-centage of speech applications compared to theNLP and computer vision papers. In NLP, neuralnetworks ﬁrst gain popularity in language modeling1,9952,0002,0052,0102,01500.20.40.6Language ModelingMachine TranslationPOS Tagging1,9952,0002,0052,0102,01500.20.40.6Speech RecognitionSpeech SynthesisSpeaker Recognition1995200020052010201500.20.4Object RecognitionObject DetectionImage SegmentationFigure 7: Historical trend for top applications of thekeyphrase neural network in NLP, speech, and CVconference papers we collected. y-axis indicatesthe ratio of papers that use neural network in thetask to the number of papers that is about the task.0204060801008486889092Pseudo-recall %Precision %With Coref.Without Coref.Figure 8: Precision/pseudo-recall curves for humanevaluation by varying cut-off thresholds.

Eachdomain expert is assigned 2 or 3 entities and all ofthe corresponding relations. Figure 8 shows preci-sion/recall curves for both systems. Since it is notfeasible to compute the actual recall of the systems,we compute the pseudo-recall (Zhang et al., 2015)based on the output of both systems. We observethat the knowledge graph curve with coreferencelinking is mostly above the curve without corefer-ence linking. The precision of both systems is high(above 84% for both systems), but the system withcoreference links has signiﬁcantly higher recall.8ConclusionIn this paper, we create a new dataset and develop amulti-task model for identifying entities, relations,and coreference clusters in scientiﬁc articles. Bysharing span representations and leveraging cross-sentence information, our multi-task setup effec-tively improves performance across all tasks. More-over, we show that our multi-task model is better atpredicting span boundaries and outperforms previ-ous state-of-the-art scientiﬁc IE systems on entityand relation extraction, without using any hand-engineered features or pipeline processing. Usingour model, we are able to automatically organizethe extracted information from a large collectionof scientiﬁc articles into a knowledge graph. Ouranalysis shows the importance of coreference linksin making a dense, useful graph.We still observe a large gap between the perfor-mance of our model and human performance, con-ﬁrming the challenges of scientiﬁc IE. Future workincludes improving the performance using semi-supervised techniques and providing in-domainfeatures. We also plan to extend our multi-taskframework to information extraction tasks in otherdomains.AcknowledgmentsThis research was supported by the Ofﬁce of NavalResearch under the MURI grant N00014-18-1-2670, NSF (IIS 1616112, III 1703166), Allen Dis-tinguished Investigator Award, and gifts from AllenInstitute for AI, Google, Amazon, and Bloomberg.We are grateful to Waleed Ammar and AI2 forsharing the Semantic Scholar Corpus.

This anal-ysis informs the construction of an adversarialdataset on which all models achieve randomaccuracy. Our adversarial dataset provides amore robust assessment of argument compre-hension and should be adopted as the standardin future work.1IntroductionArgumentation mining is the task of determin-ing argumentative structure in natural languagetext - e.g., which text segments represent claims,and which comprise reasons that support or attackthose claims (Mochales and Moens, 2011; Lippiand Torroni, 2016). This is a challenging task formachine learners, as it can be hard even for hu-mans to determine when two text segments standin argumentative relation, as evidenced by studieson argument annotation (Habernal et al., 2014).One approach to this problem is to focus onwarrants (Toulmin, 1958) - a form of worldknowledge that permit inferences. Consider a sim-ple argument: “(1) It is raining; therefore (2) youshould take an umbrella.”1The warrant “(3) itis bad to get wet” could license this inference.Knowing (3) facilitates drawing the inferentialconnection between (1) and (2). However it wouldbe hard to ﬁnd it stated anywhere since warrantsare most often left implicit (Walton, 2005). Thus,on this approach, machine learners must not onlyreason with warrants but also discover them.1This example adapted from Black and Hunter (2012)ClaimGoogle is not a harmful monopolyReasonPeople can choose not to use GoogleWarrantOther search engines don’t redirect to GoogleAlternative All other search engines redirect to GoogleReason (and since) Warrant →ClaimReason (but since) Alternative →¬ ClaimFigure 1: An example of a data point from the ARCTtest set and how it should be read. The inference fromR and A to ¬C is by design.The Argument Reasoning Comprehension Task(ARCT) (Habernal et al., 2018a) defers the prob-lem of discovering warrants and focuses on in-ference. An argument is provided, comprising aclaim C and reason R. This task is to pick the cor-rect warrant W over a distractor, called the alter-native warrant A. The alternative is written suchthat R ∧A →¬C. An alternative warrant forour earlier example could be “(4) it is good to getwet,” in which case we have (1) ∧(4) →“(¬2) youshouldn’t take an umbrella.” An example from thedataset is given in Figure 1.The ARCT SemEval shared task (Habernalet al., 2018b) veriﬁed the challenging nature ofthis problem. Even supplying warrants, learnersstill need to rely on further world knowledge. Forexample, to correctly classify the data point in Fig-ure 1 it is at least required to know how consumerchoice and web re-directs relate to the conceptof monopoly, and that Google is a search engine.All but one participating system in the shared taskcould not exceed 60% accuracy (on binary classi-ﬁcation).It is therefore surprising that BERT (Devlinet al., 2018) achieves 77% test set accuracy withits best run (Table 1), only three points below theaverage (untrained) human baseline. Without sup-plying the required world knowledge for this taskit does not seem reasonable to expect it to performso well. This motivates the question: what hasBERT learned about argument comprehension?\f4659DevTestMeanMeanMedianMaxHuman (trained)0.909 ± 0.11Human (untrained)0.798 ± 0.16BERT (Large)0.701 ± 0.050.671 ± 0.090.7120.770GIST (Choi and Lee, 2018)0.716 ± 0.010.711 ± 0.01BERT (Base)0.680 ± 0.020.623 ± 0.070.6510.685World Knowledge (Botschen et al., 2018)0.674 ± 0.010.568 ± 0.030.610BoV0.639 ± 0.020.564 ± 0.020.5690.595BiLSTM0.658 ± 0.010.552 ± 0.020.5520.592Table 1: Baselines and BERT results. Our results come from 20 different random seeds (± gives the standarddeviation). The mean for BERT Large is skewed by the 5/20 random seeds for which it failed to train, a problemnoted by Devlin et al. (2018). We therefore consider the median a better measure of BERT’s average performance.The mean of the non-degenerate runs for BERT (Large) is 0.716 ± 0.04.Figure 2: General architecture of the models in ourexperiments. Logits are independently calculated foreach argument-warrant pair then concatenated andpassed through softmax.To investigate BERT’s decision making welooked at data points it ﬁnds easy to classify overmultiple runs. Habernal et al. (2018b) performeda similar analysis with the SemEval submissions,and consistent with their results we found thatBERT exploits the presence of cue words in thewarrant, especially “not.” Through probing exper-iments designed to isolate such effects, we demon-strate in this work that BERT’s surprising perfor-mance can be entirely accounted for in terms ofexploiting spurious statistical cues.However, we show that the major problem canbe eliminated in ARCT. Since R ∧A →¬C, wecan add a copy of each data point with the claimnegated and the label inverted. This means thatthe distribution of statistical cues in the warrantswill be mirrored over both labels, eliminating thesignal. On this adversarial dataset all models per-form randomly, with BERT achieving a maximumtest set accuracy of 53%. The adversarial datasettherefore provides a more robust evaluation of ar-gument comprehension and should be adopted asthe standard in future work on this dataset.2Task Description and BaselinesLet i = 1, . . . , n index each point in the datasetD, where |D| = n. The two candidate warrantsin each case are randomly assigned a binary labelj ∈{0, 1}, such that each has an equal probabilityof being correct. The inputs are the representationsfor the claim c(i), reason r(i), warrant zero w(i)0 ,and warrant one w(i)1 . The label y(i) is a binaryindicator corresponding to the correct warrant.The general architecture for all models is givenin Figure 2. Shared parameters θ are learned toclassify each warrant independently with the ar-gument, yielding the logits:z(i)j= θ[c(i); r(i); w(i)j ]These are then concatenated and passed throughsoftmax to determine a probability distributionover the two warrants p(i) = softmax([z(i)0 , z(i)1 ]).The prediction is then ˆy(i) = arg maxj p(i).The baselines are a bag of vectors (BoV),bidirectional LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhu-ber, 1997) (BiLSTM), the SemEval winner GIST(Choi and Lee, 2018), the best model of Botschenet al. (2018), and human performance (Table 1).For all of our experiments we use grid search to se-lect hyperparameters, dropout regularization (Sri-vastava et al., 2014), and Adam (Kingma and Ba,2014) for optimization. We anneal the learningrate by 1/10 when validation accuracy drops. Theﬁnal parameters come from the epoch with maxi-mum validation accuracy. The BoV and BiLSTMinputs are 300-dimensional GloVe embeddingstrained on 640B tokens (Pennington et al., 2014).Code to reproduce all experiments, and detailingall hyperparameters, is provided on GitHub.22https://github.com/IKMLab/arct2.git\f4660Figure 3: Processing an argument-warrant pair with BERT. The reason (with word pieces of length a) and claim(length b) together form the ﬁrst utterance, and the warrant (length c) is the second. The ﬁnal CLS vector is thenpassed to a linear layer to calculate the logit z(i)j .3BERTOur BERT classiﬁer is visualized in Figure 3. Theclaim and reason are joined to form the ﬁrst textsegment, which is paired with each warrant and in-dependently processed. The ﬁnal layer CLS vectoris passed to a linear layer to obtain the logits z(i)j .The whole architecture is ﬁne-tuned. The learningrate is 2e−5 and we allow a maximum of 20 train-ing epochs, taking the parameters from the epochwith the best validation set accuracy. We use theHugging Face PyTorch implementation.3Devlin et al.(2018) report that, on smalldatasets, BERT sometimes fails to train, yield-ing degenerate results. ARCT is very small with1, 210 training observations. In 5/20 runs we en-countered this phenomenon, seeing close to ran-dom accuracies on validation and test sets. Thesecases occurred where training accuracy was alsonot signiﬁcantly above random (< 80%). Remov-ing the degenerate runs, BERT’s mean is 71.6 ±0.04., which would beat the previous state of theart - as would the median of 71.2%, which is abetter average than the overall mean since it is notskewed by the degenerate cases.However, ourmain ﬁnding is that these results are not mean-ingful and should be discarded. In the followingsections we focus on BERT’s peak performanceof 77% to make this case.3https://github.com/huggingface/pytorch-pretrained-BERT4Statistical CuesThe major source of spurious statistical cues inARCT comes from uneven distributions of lin-guistic artifacts over the warrants, and thereforeover the labels. This section aims to demonstratethe presence and nature of these cues. We onlyconsider unigrams and bigrams, although more so-phisticated cues may be present. To this end, weaim to calculate how beneﬁcial it is for a modelto exploit a cue k, and how pervasive it is in thedataset (indicating the strength of the signal).Formally, let T(i)jbe the set of tokens in the war-rant for data point i with label j.We deﬁne acue’s applicability αk as the number of data pointswhere it occurs with one label but not the other:αk =nXi=11h∃j, k ∈T(i)j∧k /∈T(i)¬jiThe productivity πk of a cue is deﬁned as the pro-portion of applicable data points for which it pre-dicts the correct answer:πk =Pni=1 1h∃j, k ∈T(i)j∧k /∈T(i)¬j ∧yi = jiαkFinally, we deﬁne the coverage ξk of a cue asthe proportion of applicable cases over the totalnumber of data points: ξk = αk/n.In theseterms, the productivity of a cue measures the ben-eﬁt of exploiting it, while coverage measures the\f4661ProductivityCoverageTrain0.650.66Validation0.620.44Test0.520.77All0.610.64Table 2: Productivity and coverage of using the pres-ence of “not” in the warrant to predict the label inARCT. Across the whole dataset, if you pick the war-rant with “not” you will be right 61% of the time, whichcovers 64% of all data points.strength of the signal it provides. With m labels,if πk > 1/m then the presence of a cue is going tobe useful for the task and a machine learner woulddo well to make use of it.The productivity and coverage of the strongestunigram cue we found (“not”) is given in Table2. It provides a particularly strong training sig-nal. While it is less productive in the test set, itis just one among many such cues. We found arange of other unigrams, albeit with less overallproductivity, mostly being high frequency wordssuch as “is,” “do,” and “are.” Bigrams that oc-curred with not, such as “will not” and “cannot,”were also found to be highly productive. Thesestatistics indicate the nature of the problem. In thenext section we demonstrate that our models are infact exploiting these cues.5Probing ExperimentsIf a model is exploiting distributional cues over thelabels, then if trained only on the warrants (W) itshould perform relatively well. The same can besaid for removing either just the claim, leaving thereason and warrant (R, W), or removing the reason(C, W). The latter setups allow the models to addi-tionally consider cues in the reasons and claims,as well as cues holding over their combinationswith the warrants. Each of these setups breaks thetask since we no longer have an argument to matchwith a warrant.Experimental results are given in Table 3. Onwarrants alone (W) BERT achieves a maximum71% accuracy.That leaves only six percentagepoints to account for its peak of 77%. We ﬁnda gain of four percentage points for (R, W) over(W), and a gain of two for (C, W), accounting forthe missing six points. Based on this evidence ourmajor ﬁnding is that the entirety of BERT’s perfor-mance can be accounted for in terms of exploitingspurious statistical cues.TestMeanMedianMaxBERT0.671 ± 0.090.7120.770BERT (W)0.656 ± 0.050.6750.712BERT (R, W)0.600 ± 0.100.5740.750BERT (C, W)0.532 ± 0.090.5030.732BoV0.564 ± 0.020.5690.595BoV (W)0.567 ± 0.020.5720.606BoV (R, W)0.554 ± 0.020.5570.579BoV (C, W)0.545 ± 0.020.5440.589BiLSTM0.552 ± 0.020.5520.592BiLSTM (W)0.550 ± 0.020.5470.577BiLSTM (R, W)0.547 ± 0.020.5510.577BiLSTM (C, W)0.552 ± 0.020.5500.601Table 3: Results of probing experiments with BERTLarge, and the BoV and BiLSTM baselines. These re-sults indicate that BERT’s peak 77% performance canbe entirely accounted for by exploiting spurious cues.By just considering warrants (W) we can get to 71%.Adding cues over reasons (R, W) and claims (C, W)accounts for the remaining six points.6Adversarial Test SetThe major problem of statistical cues over labelsin ARCT can be eliminated due the original de-sign of the dataset. Given that R ∧A →¬C,we can produce adversarial examples by negat-ing the claim and inverting the label for each datapoint (Figure 4).The adversarial examples arethen combined with the original data. This elim-inates the problem by mirroring the distributionsof cues around both labels. The ARCT authorsprovide a training set augmented in this way. Thenegation of most claims in the validation and testsets already exist elsewhere in the dataset. The re-maining claims were manually negated by a nativeEnglish speaker.We tried two experimental setups. In the ﬁrst,models trained and validated on the original datawere evaluated on the adversarial set. All resultswere worse than random due to overﬁtting the cuesin the original training set. In the second, mod-els were trained from scratch on the adversarialtraining and validation sets, then evaluated on theadversarial test set. Results are given in Table 4.BERT’s peak performance has reduced to 53%,with mean and median at 50%. We conclude fromthese results that the adversarial dataset has suc-cessfully eliminated the cues as expected, provid-ing a more robust evaluation of machine argumentcomprehension. This result better apts with ourintuitions about this task: with little to no under-standing about the reality underlying these argu-ments, good performance shouldn’t be feasible.\f4662OriginalAdversarialClaimGoogle is not a harmful monopolyGoogle is a harmful monopolyReasonPeople can choose not to use GooglePeople can choose not to use GoogleWarrantOther search engines do not redirect to GoogleAll other search engines redirect to GoogleAlternativeAll other search engines redirect to GoogleOther search engines do not redirect to GoogleFigure 4: Original and adversarial data points. The claim is negated and the warrants are swapped. The assignmentof labels to W and A are kept the same. By including both, the distribution of linguistic artifacts in the warrantsare thereby mirrored around the labels, eliminating the major source of spurious statistical cues in ARCT.7Related WorkThe most successful previous work on ARCT(Choi and Lee, 2018; Zhao et al., 2018; Niven andKao, 2018) involved transfer learning from Natu-ral Language Inference (NLI) datasets (Bowmanet al., 2015; Williams et al., 2017), and utilizedeffective NLI models such as ESIM (Chen et al.,2016) and InferSent (Conneau et al., 2017). Morerecently, Botschen et al. (2018) added FrameNetknowledge with modest performance gains. Thesemodels should be evaluated on our adversarialdataset.In particular it will be interesting ifBotschen et al.’s model stands out due to the in-clusion of some of the required world knowledge.There is much recent work focusing on statis-tical cues in datasets in vision (Jo and Bengio,2017) and NLP (Sanchez et al., 2018; McCoyet al., 2019; Gururangan et al., 2018; Glockneret al., 2018; Poliak et al., 2018; Rajpurkar et al.,2018; Jia and Liang, 2017). Similar to our exper-iment with warrants, Poliak et al. (2018) classi-ﬁed NLI data based on the hypothesis only.Asimilar experiment to our probing task was per-formed by Niven and Kao (2018), but only withreasons and warrants. They found that indepen-dent warrant classiﬁcation with shared parametersprovides some regularization against warrant-labelcues (Niven and Kao, 2018). However, this doesnot solve the problem since the presence of a cueis enough to increase the logits for either warrant.The original ARCT data comes with a train-ing set created in the same way as our adversarialdataset. Habernal et al. (2018a) reported experi-ments using this training data that led to randomaccuracy.They suggested it could be that highsimilarity between the data points made the prob-lem too difﬁcult for the simple models they imple-mented. Our work indicates the necessity of ap-plying this transformation to the entire dataset inorder to obtain a more robust evaluation by elimi-nating spurious statistical cues over the labels.TestMeanMedianMaxBERT0.504 ± 0.010.5050.533BERT (W)0.501 ± 0.000.5010.502BERT (R, W)0.500 ± 0.000.5000.502BERT (C, W)0.501 ± 0.010.5000.518Table 4: Results for BERT Large on the adversarial testset with adversarial training and validation sets.8ConclusionARCT provides a fortuitous opportunity to seehow stark the problem of exploiting spuriousstatistics can be. Due to our ability to eliminate themajor source of these cues, we were able to showthat BERT’s maximum performance fell from justthree points below the average untrained humanbaseline to essentially random.To answer ourquestion in the introduction: BERT has learnednothing about argument comprehension.However, our investigations conﬁrmed thatBERT is indeed a very strong learner. Analysisof easy to classify data points showed reliance ona lower proportion of the strongest cue word thanthe BoV and BiLSTM - i.e. BERT has learnedwhen to ignore the presence of “not” and focus ondifferent cues. This indicates an ability to exploitmuch more subtle joint distributional information.As our learners get stronger, controlling for spu-rious statistics becomes more important in orderto have conﬁdence in their apparent performance.Taken with a growing body of previous work, ourresults indicate the need for further research intothe extent of this problem in NLP more generally.The adversarial dataset should be adopted as thestandard in future work on ARCT. We hope thatproviding a more robust evaluation will help tospur more productive research on this problem.AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank Ivan Habernal, and the re-viewers, for their helpful comments.\f4663ReferencesElizabeth Black and Anthony Hunter. 2012.Arelevance-theoretic framework for constructing anddeconstructing enthymemes.J.

But workin this direction has been conducted on dif-ferent datasets and tasks with correspondinglyunique aims and metrics; this makes it difﬁcultto track progress. We propose the EvaluatingRationales And Simple English Reasoning(ERASER) benchmark to advance researchon interpretable models in NLP. This bench-mark comprises multiple datasets and tasks forwhich human annotations of “rationales” (sup-porting evidence) have been collected. We pro-pose several metrics that aim to capture howwell the rationales provided by models alignwith human rationales, and also how faithfulthese rationales are (i.e., the degree to whichprovided rationales inﬂuenced the correspond-ing predictions). Our hope is that releasing thisbenchmark facilitates progress on designingmore interpretable NLP systems. The bench-mark, code, and documentation are availableat https://www.eraserbenchmark.com/1IntroductionInterest has recently grown in designing NLP sys-tems that can reveal why models make speciﬁcpredictions. But work in this direction has beenconducted on different datasets and using differentmetrics to quantify performance; this has made itdifﬁcult to compare methods and track progress.We aim to address this issue by releasing a stan-dardized benchmark of datasets — repurposed andaugmented from pre-existing corpora, spanning arange of NLP tasks — and associated metrics formeasuring different properties of rationales.

The ‘erased’ snippets are rationales.In curating and releasing ERASER we take in-spiration from the stickiness of the GLUE (Wanget al., 2019b) and SuperGLUE (Wang et al., 2019a)benchmarks for evaluating progress in natural lan-guage understanding tasks, which have driven rapidprogress on models for general language repre-sentation learning. We believe the still somewhatnascent subﬁeld of interpretable NLP stands to ben-eﬁt similarly from an analogous collection of stan-dardized datasets and tasks; we hope these willaid the design of standardized metrics to measuredifferent properties of ‘interpretability’, and wepropose a set of such metrics as a starting point.Interpretability is a broad topic with many possi-ble realizations (Doshi-Velez and Kim, 2017; Lip-ton, 2016). In ERASER we focus speciﬁcally onrationales, i.e., snippets that support outputs. Alldatasets in ERASER include such rationales, ex-plicitly marked by human annotators. By deﬁnition,rationales should be sufﬁcient to make predictions,\f4444but they may not be comprehensive. Therefore, forsome datasets, we have also collected comprehen-sive rationales (in which all evidence supportingan output has been marked) on test instances.The ‘quality’ of extracted rationales will dependon their intended use. Therefore, we propose aninitial set of metrics to evaluate rationales thatare meant to measure different varieties of ‘inter-pretability’. Broadly, this includes measures ofagreement with human-provided rationales, and as-sessments of faithfulness. The latter aim to capturethe extent to which rationales provided by a modelin fact informed its predictions. We believe theseprovide a reasonable start, but view the problem ofdesigning metrics for evaluating rationales — espe-cially for measuring faithfulness — as a topic forfurther research that ERASER can facilitate. Andwhile we will provide a ‘leaderboard’, this is betterviewed as a ‘results board’; we do not privilegeany one metric. Instead, ERASER permits compar-ison between models that provide rationales withrespect to different criteria of interest.We implement baseline models and report theirperformance across the corpora in ERASER. Weﬁnd that no single ‘off-the-shelf’ architecture isreadily adaptable to datasets with very differentinstance lengths and associated rationale snippets(Section 3). This highlights a need for new modelsthat can consume potentially lengthy inputs andadaptively provide rationales at a task-appropriatelevel of granularity. ERASER provides a resourceto develop such models.In sum, we introduce the ERASER benchmark(www.eraserbenchmark.com), a uniﬁed set of di-verse NLP datasets (these are repurposed and aug-mented from existing corpora,1 including senti-ment analysis, Natural Language Inference, andQA tasks, among others) in a standardized for-mat featuring human rationales for decisions, alongwith starter code and tools, baseline models, andstandardized (initial) metrics for rationales.2Related WorkInterpretability in NLP is a large, fast-growingarea; we do not attempt to provide a comprehensiveoverview here. Instead we focus on directions par-ticularly relevant to ERASER, i.e., prior work onmodels that provide rationales for their predictions.Learning to explain. In ERASER we assume that1We ask users of the benchmark to cite all original papers,and provide a BibTeX entry for doing so on the website.rationales (marked by humans) are provided duringtraining. However, such direct supervision will notalways be available, motivating work on methodsthat can explain (or “rationalize”) model predic-tions using only instance-level supervision.In the context of modern neural models for textclassiﬁcation, one might use variants of attention(Bahdanau et al., 2015) to extract rationales. At-tention mechanisms learn to assign soft weights to(usually contextualized) token representations, andso one can extract highly weighted tokens as ratio-nales. However, attention weights do not in gen-eral provide faithful explanations for predictions(Jain and Wallace, 2019; Serrano and Smith, 2019;Wiegreffe and Pinter, 2019; Zhong et al., 2019;Pruthi et al., 2020; Brunner et al., 2020; Moradiet al., 2019; Vashishth et al., 2019). This likelyowes to encoders entangling inputs, complicatingthe interpretation of attention weights on inputsover contextualized representations of the same.2By contrast, hard attention mechanisms dis-cretely extract snippets from the input to pass to theclassiﬁer, by construction providing faithful expla-nations. Recent work has proposed hard attentionmechanisms as a means of providing explanations.Lei et al. (2016) proposed instantiating two modelswith their own parameters; one to extract rationales,and one that consumes these to make a prediction.They trained these models jointly via REINFORCE(Williams, 1992) style optimization.Recently, Jain et al. (2020) proposed a variantof this two-model setup that uses heuristic featurescores to derive pseudo-labels on tokens compris-ing rationales; one model can then be used to per-form hard extraction in this way, while a second(independent) model can make predictions on thebasis of these. Elsewhere, Chang et al. (2019)introduced the notion of classwise rationales thatexplains support for different output classes usinga game theoretic framework. Finally, other recentwork has proposed using a differentiable binarymask over inputs, which also avoids recourse toREINFORCE (Bastings et al., 2019).Post-hoc explanation. Another strand of inter-pretability work considers post-hoc explanationmethods, which seek to explain why a model madea speciﬁc prediction for a given input. Commonly2Interestingly, Zhong et al. (2019) ﬁnd that attention some-times provides plausible but not faithful rationales. Elsewhere,Pruthi et al. (2020) show that one can easily learn to deceivevia attention weights. These ﬁndings highlight that one shouldbe mindful of the criteria one wants rationales to fulﬁll.\f4445these take the form of token-level importancescores. Gradient-based explanations are a standardexample (Sundararajan et al., 2017; Smilkov et al.,2017). These enjoy a clear semantics (describinghow perturbing inputs locally affects outputs), butmay nonetheless exhibit counterintuitive behaviors(Feng et al., 2018).Gradients of course assume model differentia-bility. Other methods do not require any modelproperties. Examples include LIME (Ribeiro et al.,2016) and Alvarez-Melis and Jaakkola (2017);these methods approximate model behavior lo-cally by having it repeatedly make predictions overperturbed inputs and ﬁtting a simple, explainablemodel over the outputs.Acquiring rationales. Aside from interpretabilityconsiderations, collecting rationales from annota-tors may afford greater efﬁciency in terms of modelperformance realized given a ﬁxed amount of anno-tator effort (Zaidan and Eisner, 2008). In particular,recent work by McDonnell et al. (2017, 2016) hasobserved that at least for some tasks, asking anno-tators to provide rationales justifying their catego-rizations does not impose much additional effort.Combining rationale annotation with active learn-ing (Settles, 2012) is another promising direction(Wallace et al., 2010; Sharma et al., 2015).Learning from rationales. Work on learning fromrationales marked by annotators for text classiﬁca-tion dates back over a decade (Zaidan et al., 2007).Earlier efforts proposed extending standard dis-criminative models like Support Vector Machines(SVMs) with regularization terms that penalizedparameter estimates which disagreed with providedrationales (Zaidan et al., 2007; Small et al., 2011).Other efforts have attempted to specify generativemodels of rationales (Zaidan and Eisner, 2008).More recent work has aimed to exploit ratio-nales in training neural text classiﬁers. Zhang et al.(2016) proposed a rationale-augmented Convolu-tional Neural Network (CNN) for text classiﬁca-tion, explicitly trained to identify sentences support-ing categorizations. Strout et al. (2019) showed thatproviding this model with rationales during train-ing yields predicted rationales that are preferredby humans (compared to rationales produced with-out explicit supervision). Other work has proposed‘pipeline’ approaches in which independent mod-els are trained to perform rationale extraction andclassiﬁcation on the basis of these, respectively(Lehman et al., 2019; Chen et al., 2019), assumingNameSize (train/dev/test)TokensComp?Evidence Inference7958 / 972 / 9594761◇BoolQ6363 / 1491 / 28173583◇Movie Reviews1600 / 200 / 200774◆FEVER97957 / 6122 / 6111327!MultiRC24029 / 3214 / 4848303!CoS-E8733 / 1092 / 109228!e-SNLI911938 / 16449 / 1642916!Table 1: Overview of datasets in the ERASER bench-mark.

(2019) ﬁne-tuned a Transformer-based language model (Radford et al., 2018) onfree-text rationales provided by humans, with anobjective of generating open-ended explanations toimprove performance on downstream tasks.Evaluating rationales. Work on evaluating ratio-nales has often compared these to human judg-ments (Strout et al., 2019; Doshi-Velez and Kim,2017), or elicited other human evaluations of ex-planations (Ribeiro et al., 2016; Lundberg and Lee,2017; Nguyen, 2018). There has also been work onvisual evaluations of saliency maps (Li et al., 2016;Ding et al., 2017; Sundararajan et al., 2017).Measuring agreement between extracted andhuman rationales (or collecting subjective assess-ments of them) assesses the plausibility of ratio-nales, but such approaches do not establish whetherthe model actually relied on these particular ratio-nales to make a prediction. We refer to rationalesthat correspond to the inputs most relied upon tocome to a disposition as faithful.Most automatic evaluations of faithfulness mea-sure the impact of perturbing or erasing words ortokens identiﬁed as important on model output (Ar-ras et al., 2017; Montavon et al., 2017; Serrano andSmith, 2019; Samek et al., 2016; Jain and Wallace,2019). We build upon these methods in Section4. Finally, we note that a recent article urges thecommunity to evaluate faithfulness on a continuousscale of acceptability, rather than viewing this as abinary proposition (Jacovi and Goldberg, 2020).3Datasets in ERASERFor all datasets in ERASER we distribute both ref-erence labels and rationales marked by humansas supporting these in a standardized format. We\f4446delineate train, validation, and test splits for allcorpora (see Appendix A for processing details).We ensure that these splits comprise disjoint setsof source documents to avoid contamination.3 Wehave made the decision to distribute the test setspublicly,4 in part because we do not view the ‘cor-rect’ metrics to use as settled. We plan to acquireadditional human annotations on held-out portionsof some of the included corpora so as to offer hid-den test set evaluation opportunities in the future.Evidence inference (Lehman et al., 2019).Adataset of full-text articles describing randomizedcontrolled trials (RCTs).The task is to inferwhether a given intervention is reported to eithersigniﬁcantly increase, signiﬁcantly decrease, orhave no signiﬁcant effect on a speciﬁed outcome, ascompared to a comparator of interest. Rationaleshave been marked as supporting these inferences.As the original annotations are not necessarily ex-haustive, we collected exhaustive rationale annota-tions on a subset of the validation and test data.5BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019). This corpus consistsof passages selected from Wikipedia, and yes/noquestions generated from these passages. As theoriginal Wikipedia article versions used were notmaintained, we have made a best-effort attempt torecover these, and then ﬁnd within them the pas-sages answering the corresponding questions. Forpublic release, we acquired comprehensive annota-tions on a subset of documents in our test set.5Movie Reviews (Zaidan and Eisner, 2008). In-cludes positive/negative sentiment labels on moviereviews. Original rationale annotations were notnecessarily comprehensive; we thus collected com-prehensive rationales on the ﬁnal two folds of theoriginal dataset (Pang and Lee, 2004).5 In contrastto most other datasets, the rationale annotationshere are span level as opposed to sentence level.FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018). Short for Fact Ex-traction and VERiﬁcation; entails verifying claimsfrom textual sources. Speciﬁcally, each claim is tobe classiﬁed as supported, refuted or not enoughinformation with reference to a collection of source3Except for BoolQ, wherein source documents in the orig-inal train and validation set were not disjoint and we preservethis structure in our dataset. Questions, of course, are disjoint.4Consequently, for datasets that have been part of previ-ous benchmarks with other aims (namely, GLUE/superGLUE)but which we have re-purposed for work on rationales inERASER, e.g., BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019), we have carved outfor release test sets from the original validation sets.5Annotation details are in Appendix B.texts. We take a subset of this dataset, includingonly supported and refuted claims.MultiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018). A reading com-prehension dataset composed of questions withmultiple correct answers that by construction de-pend on information from multiple sentences. Hereeach rationale is associated with a question, whileanswers are independent of one another. We con-vert each rationale/question/answer triplet into aninstance within our dataset. Each answer candidatethen has a label of True or False.Commonsense Explanations (CoS-E) (Rajaniet al., 2019).This corpus comprises multiple-choice questions and answers from (Talmor et al.,2019) along with supporting rationales. The ratio-nales in this case come in the form both of high-lighted (extracted) supporting snippets and free-text, open-ended descriptions of reasoning. Givenour focus on extractive rationales, ERASER in-cludes only the former for now. Following Talmoret al. (2019), we repartition the training and valida-tion sets to provide a canonical test split.e-SNLI (Camburu et al., 2018). This dataset aug-ments the SNLI corpus (Bowman et al., 2015) withrationales marked in the premise and/or hypothesis(and natural language explanations, which we donot use). For entailment pairs, annotators were re-quired to highlight at least one word in the premise.For contradiction pairs, annotators had to highlightat least one word in both the premise and the hy-pothesis; for neutral pairs, they were only allowedto highlight words in the hypothesis.Human Agreement We report human agreementover extracted rationales for multiple annotatorsand documents in Table 2. All datasets have a highCohen κ (Cohen, 1960); with substantial or betteragreement.4MetricsIn ERASER models are evaluated both for theirpredictive performance and with respect to the ra-tionales that they extract. For the former, we relyon the established metrics for the respective tasks.Here we describe the metrics we propose to eval-uate the quality of extracted rationales. We donot claim that these are necessarily the best met-rics for evaluating rationales, however. Indeed, wehope the release of ERASER will spur additionalresearch into how best to measure the quality ofmodel explanations in the context of NLP.\f4447DatasetCohen κF1PR#Annotators/doc#DocumentsEvidence Inference------BoolQ0.618 ± 0.1940.617 ± 0.2270.647 ± 0.2600.726 ± 0.2173199Movie Reviews0.712 ± 0.1350.799 ± 0.1380.693 ± 0.1530.989 ± 0.102296FEVER0.854 ± 0.1960.871 ± 0.1970.931 ± 0.2050.855 ± 0.198224MultiRC0.728 ± 0.2680.749 ± 0.2650.695 ± 0.2840.910 ± 0.259299CoS-E0.619 ± 0.3080.654 ± 0.3170.626 ± 0.3190.792 ± 0.3712100e-SNLI0.743 ± 0.1620.799 ± 0.1300.812 ± 0.1540.853 ± 0.12439807Table 2: Human agreement with respect to rationales. For Movie Reviews and BoolQ we calculate the meanagreement of individual annotators with the majority vote per token, over the two-three annotators we hired viaUpwork and Amazon Turk, respectively. The e-SNLI dataset already comprised three annotators; for this wecalculate mean agreement between individuals and the majority. For CoS-E, MultiRC, and FEVER, members ofour team annotated a subset to use a comparison to the (majority of, where appropriate) existing rationales. Wecollected comprehensive rationales for Evidence Inference from Medical Doctors; as they have a high amount ofexpertise, we would expect agreement to be high, but have not collected redundant comprehensive annotations.4.1Agreement with human rationalesThe simplest means of evaluating extracted ratio-nales is to measure how well they agree with thosemarked by humans. We consider two classes ofmetrics, appropriate for models that perform dis-crete and ‘soft’ selection, respectively.For the discrete case, measuring exact matchesbetween predicted and reference rationales is likelytoo harsh.6 We thus consider more relaxed mea-sures.These include Intersection-Over-Union(IOU), borrowed from computer vision (Evering-ham et al., 2010), which permits credit assignmentfor partial matches. We deﬁne IOU on a token level:for two spans, it is the size of the overlap of thetokens they cover divided by the size of their union.We count a prediction as a match if it overlaps withany of the ground truth rationales by more thansome threshold (here, 0.5). We use these partialmatches to calculate an F1 score. We also measuretoken-level precision and recall, and use these toderive token-level F1 scores.Metrics for continuous or soft token scoringmodels consider token rankings, rewarding modelsfor assigning higher scores to marked tokens. Inparticular, we take the Area Under the Precision-Recall curve (AUPRC) constructed by sweeping athreshold over token scores. We deﬁne additionalmetrics for soft scoring models below.In general, the rationales we have for tasks aresufﬁcient to make judgments, but not necessarilycomprehensive. However, for some datasets wehave explicitly collected comprehensive rationalesfor at least a subset of the test set. Therefore, onthese datasets recall evaluates comprehensivenessdirectly (it does so only noisily on other datasets).6Consider that an extra token destroys the match but notusually the meaningWe highlight which corpora contain comprehensiverationales in the test set in Table 3.4.2Measuring faithfulnessAs discussed above, a model may provide ratio-nales that are plausible (agreeable to humans) butthat it did not rely on for its output. In many set-tings one may want rationales that actually explainmodel predictions, i.e., rationales extracted for aninstance in this case ought to have meaningfully in-ﬂuenced its prediction for the same. We call thesefaithful rationales. How best to measure rationalefaithfulness is an open question. In this ﬁrst versionof ERASER we propose simple metrics motivatedby prior work (Zaidan et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2019).In particular, following Yu et al. (2019) we deﬁnemetrics intended to measure the comprehensiveness(were all features needed to make a prediction se-lected?) and sufﬁciency (do the extracted rationalescontain enough signal to come to a disposition?) ofrationales, respectively.Comprehensiveness.To calculate rationalecomprehensiveness we create contrast exam-ples (Zaidan et al., 2007): We construct a con-trast example for xi, ˜xi, which is xi with the pre-dicted rationales ri removed. Assuming a classiﬁ-cation setting, let m(xi)j be the original predictionprovided by a model m for the predicted class j.Then we consider the predicted probability fromthe model for the same class once the supportingrationales are stripped. Intuitively, the model oughtto be less conﬁdent in its prediction once rationalesare removed from xi. We can measure this as:comprehensiveness = m(xi)j −m(xi/ri)j(1)A high score here implies that the rationales wereindeed inﬂuential in the prediction, while a lowscore suggests that they were not. A negative value\f4448Where do you ﬁnd the most amount of leafs?Where do you ﬁnd the most amount of leafs?(a) Compost pile (b) Flowers(c) Forest(d) Field(e) Ground(a) Compost pile (b) Flowers(c) Forest(d) Field(e) Ground……ˆp(Forest|xi)Where do you ﬁnd the most amount of leafs?(a) Compost pile (b) Flowers(c) Forest(d) Field(e) Ground…ComprehensivenessSuﬃency˜xixiriFigure 2: Illustration of faithfulness scoring metrics, comprehensiveness and sufﬁciency, on the CommonsenseExplanations (CoS-E) dataset.

For the latter, the model should be able to come to a similardisposition regarding ‘Forest’ using only the rationales ri.here means that the model became more conﬁdentin its prediction after the rationales were removed;this would seem counter-intuitive if the rationaleswere indeed the reason for its prediction.Sufﬁciency. This captures the degree to whichthe snippets within the extracted rationales are ade-quate for a model to make a prediction.sufﬁciency = m(xi)j −m(ri)j(2)These metrics are illustrated in Figure 2.As deﬁned, the above measures have assumeddiscrete rationales ri. We would also like to eval-uate the faithfulness of continuous importancescores assigned to tokens by models. Here weadopt a simple approach for this. We convert softscores over features si provided by a model intodiscrete rationales ri by taking the top−kd values,where kd is a threshold for dataset d. We set kd tothe average rationale length provided by humansfor dataset d (see Table 4). Intuitively, this says:How much does the model prediction change if weremove a number of tokens equal to what humansuse (on average for this dataset) in order of theimportance scores assigned to these by the model.Once we have discretized the soft scores into ra-tionales in this way, we compute the faithfulnessscores as per Equations 1 and 2.This approach is conceptually simple. It is alsocomputationally cheap to evaluate, in contrast tomeasures that require per-token measurements, e.g.,importance score correlations with ‘leave-one-out’scores (Jain and Wallace, 2019), or counting howmany ‘important’ tokens need to be erased beforea prediction ﬂips (Serrano and Smith, 2019). How-ever, the necessity of discretizing continuous scoresforces us to pick a particular threshold k.We can also consider the behavior of these mea-sures as a function of k, inspired by the measure-ments proposed in Samek et al. (2016) in the con-text of evaluating saliency maps for image classi-ﬁcation. They suggested ranking pixel regions byimportance and then measuring the change in out-put as they are removed in rank order. Our datasetscomprise documents and rationales with quite dif-ferent lengths; to make this measure comparableacross datasets, we construct bins designating thenumber of tokens to be deleted. Denoting the to-kens up to and including bin k for instance i by rik,we deﬁne an aggregate comprehensiveness mea-sure:1∣B∣+ 1(∣B∣∑k=0m(xi)j −m(xi/rik)j)(3)This is deﬁned for sufﬁciency analogously. Herewe group tokens into k = 5 bins by grouping theminto the top 1%, 5%, 10%, 20% and 50% of to-kens, with respect to the corresponding importancescore. We refer to these metrics as “Area Over thePerturbation Curve” (AOPC).7These AOPC sufﬁciency and comprehensivenessmeasures score a particular token ordering undera model. As a point of reference, we also reportthese when random scores are assigned to tokens.7Our AOPC metrics are similar in concept to ROAR(Hooker et al., 2019) except that we re-use an existing modelas opposed to retraining for each fraction.\f44495Baseline ModelsOur focus in this work is primarily on the ERASERbenchmark itself, rather than on any particularmodel(s). But to establish a starting point for futurework, we evaluate several baseline models acrossthe corpora in ERASER.8 We broadly classify theseinto models that assign ‘soft’ (continuous) scoresto tokens, and those that perform a ‘hard’ (discrete)selection over inputs. We additionally considermodels speciﬁcally designed to select individualtokens (and very short sequences) as rationales, ascompared to longer snippets. All of our implemen-tations are in PyTorch (Paszke et al., 2019) and areavailable in the ERASER repository.9All datasets in ERASER comprise inputs, ratio-nales, and labels. But they differ considerably indocument and rationale lengths (Table A). This mo-tivated use of different models for datasets, appro-priate to their sizes and rationale granularities. Wehope that this benchmark motivates design of mod-els that provide rationales that can ﬂexibly adapt tovarying input lengths and expected rationale gran-ularities. Indeed, only with such models can weperform comparisons across all datasets.5.1Hard selectionModels that perform hard selection may be viewedas comprising two independent modules: an en-coder which is responsible for extracting snippetsof inputs, and a decoder that makes a predictionbased only on the text provided by the encoder. Weconsider two variants of such models.Lei et al. (2016). In this model, an encoder in-duces a binary mask over inputs x, z. The decoderaccepts the tokens in x unmasked by z to make aprediction ˆy. These modules are trained jointly viaREINFORCE (Williams, 1992) style estimation,minimizing the loss over expected binary vectorsz yielded from the encoder. One of the advantagesof this approach is that it need not have access tomarked rationales; it can learn to rationalize on thebasis of instance labels alone. However, given thatwe do have rationales in the training data, we exper-iment with a variant in which we train the encoderexplicitly using rationale-level annotations.In our implementation of Lei et al. (2016), wedrop in two independent BERT (Devlin et al., 2019)or GloVe (Pennington et al., 2014) base modules8This is not intended to be comprehensive.9https://github.com/jayded/eraserbenchmarkwith bidirectional LSTMs (Hochreiter and Schmid-huber, 1997) on top to induce contextualized rep-resentations of tokens for the encoder and decoder,respectively. The encoder generates a scalar (de-noting the probability of selecting that token) foreach LSTM hidden state using a feedfoward layerand sigmoid. In the variant using human rationalesduring training, we minimize cross entropy lossover rationale predictions. The ﬁnal loss is thena composite of classiﬁcation loss, regularizers onrationales (Lei et al., 2016), and loss over rationalepredictions, when available.Pipeline models.These are simple models inwhich we ﬁrst train the encoder to extract ratio-nales, and then train the decoder to perform pre-diction using only rationales. No parameters areshared between the two models.Here we ﬁrst consider a simple pipeline that ﬁrstsegments inputs into sentences. It passes these,one at a time, through a Gated Recurrent Unit(GRU) (Cho et al., 2014), to yield hidden represen-tations that we compose via an attentive decodinglayer (Bahdanau et al., 2015). This aggregate rep-resentation is then passed to a classiﬁcation modulewhich predicts whether the corresponding sentenceis a rationale (or not). A second model, using effec-tively the same architecture but parameterized inde-pendently, consumes the outputs (rationales) fromthe ﬁrst to make predictions. This simple model isdescribed at length in prior work (Lehman et al.,2019). We further consider a ‘BERT-to-BERT’pipeline, where we replace each stage with a BERTmodule for prediction (Devlin et al., 2019).In pipeline models, we train each stage indepen-dently. The rationale identiﬁcation stage is trainedusing approximate sentence boundaries from oursource annotations, with randomly sampled neg-ative examples at each epoch. The classiﬁcationstage uses the same positive rationales as the iden-tiﬁcation stage, a type of teacher forcing (Williamsand Zipser, 1989) (details in Appendix C).5.2Soft selectionWe consider a model that passes tokens throughBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) to induce contextual-ized representations that are then passed to a bi-directional LSTM (Hochreiter and Schmidhuber,1997). The hidden representations from the LSTMare collapsed into a single vector using additiveattention (Bahdanau et al., 2015). The LSTM layerallows us to bypass the 512 word limit imposed by\f4450Perf.IOU F1Token F1Evidence InferenceLei et al. (2016)0.4610.0000.000Lei et al. (2016) (u)0.4610.0000.000Lehman et al.

Perf. is ac-curacy (CoS-E) or F1 (others). Comprehensiveness andsufﬁciency are in terms of AOPC (Eq. 3). ‘Random’assigns random scores to tokens to induce orderings;these are averages over 10 runs.6EvaluationHere we present initial results for the baseline mod-els discussed in Section 5, with respect to the met-rics proposed in Section 4. We present results intwo parts, reﬂecting the two classes of rationalesdiscussed above: ‘Hard’ approaches that performdiscrete selection of snippets, and ‘soft’ methodsthat assign continuous importance scores to tokens.In Table 3 we evaluate models that perform dis-crete selection of rationales. We view these as in-herently faithful, because by construction we knowwhich snippets the decoder used to make a pre-diction.10 Therefore, for these methods we reportonly metrics that measure agreement with humanannotations.10This assumes independent encoders and decoders.\f4451Due to computational constraints, we were un-able to run our BERT-based implementation of Leiet al. (2016) over larger corpora. Conversely, thesimple pipeline of Lehman et al. (2019) assumesa setting in which rationale are sentences, and sois not appropriate for datasets in which rationalestend to comprise only very short spans. Again, inour view this highlights the need for models thatcan rationalize at varying levels of granularity, de-pending on what is appropriate.We observe that for the “rationalizing” modelof Lei et al. (2016), exploiting rationale-level super-vision often (though not always) improves agree-ment with human-provided rationales, as in priorwork (Zhang et al., 2016; Strout et al., 2019). In-terestingly, this does not seem strongly correlatedwith predictive performance.Lei et al. (2016) outperforms the simple pipelinemodel when using a BERT encoder. Further, Leiet al. (2016) outperforms the ‘BERT-to-BERT’pipeline on the comparable datasets for the ﬁnalprediction tasks. This may be an artifact of theamount of text each model can select: ‘BERT-to-BERT’ is limited to sentences, while Lei et al.(2016) can select any subset of the text. Designingextraction models that learn to adaptively selectcontiguous rationales of appropriate length for agiven task seems a potentially promising direction.In Table 4 we report metrics for models thatassign continuous importance scores to individ-ual tokens. For these models we again measuredownstream (task) performance (macro F1 or ac-curacy). Here the models are actually the same,and so downstream performance is equivalent. Toassess the quality of token scores with respect tohuman annotations, we report the Area Under thePrecision Recall Curve (AUPRC).These scoring functions assign only soft scoresto inputs (and may still use all inputs to come toa particular prediction), so we report the metricsintended to measure faithfulness deﬁned above:comprehensiveness and sufﬁciency, averaged over‘bins’ of tokens ordered by importance scores. Toprovide a point of reference for these metrics —which depend on the underlying model — we re-port results when rationales are randomly selected(averaged over 10 runs).Both simple gradient and LIME-based scoringyield more comprehensive rationales than attentionweights, consistent with prior work (Jain and Wal-lace, 2019; Serrano and Smith, 2019). Attentionfares better in terms of AUPRC — suggesting bet-ter agreement with human rationales — which isalso in line with prior ﬁndings that it may provideplausible, but not faithful, explanation (Zhong et al.,2019). Interestingly, LIME does particularly wellacross these tasks in terms of faithfulness.From the ‘Random’ results that we concludemodels with overall poor performance on their ﬁ-nal tasks tend to have an overall poor ordering, withmarginal differences in comprehensiveness and suf-ﬁciency between them. For models that with highsufﬁciency scores: Movies, FEVER, CoS-E, and e-SNLI, we ﬁnd that random removal is particularlydamaging to performance, indicating poor absoluteranking; whereas those with high comprehensive-ness are sensitive to rationale length.7Conclusions and Future DirectionsWe have introduced a new publicly available re-source: the Evaluating Rationales And Simple En-glish Reasoning (ERASER) benchmark. This com-prises seven datasets, all of which include bothinstance level labels and corresponding supportingsnippets (‘rationales’) marked by human annotators.We have augmented many of these datasets withadditional annotations, and converted them into astandard format comprising inputs, rationales, andoutputs. ERASER is intended to facilitate progresson explainable models for NLP.We proposed several metrics intended to mea-sure the quality of rationales extracted by models,both in terms of agreement with human annota-tions, and in terms of ‘faithfulness’. We believethese metrics provide reasonable means of compar-ison of speciﬁc aspects of interpretability, but weview the problem of measuring faithfulness, in par-ticular, a topic ripe for additional research (whichERASER can facilitate).Our hope is that ERASER enables future workon designing more interpretable NLP models, andcomparing their relative strengths across a vari-ety of tasks, datasets, and desired criteria. It alsoserves as an ideal starting point for several futuredirections such as better evaluation metrics for in-terpretability, causal analysis of NLP models anddatasets of rationales in other languages.8AcknowledgementsWe thank the anonymous ACL reviewers.This work was supported in part by the NSF (CA-REER award 1750978), and by the Army ResearchOfﬁce (W911NF1810328).\f4452ReferencesDavid Alvarez-Melis and Tommi Jaakkola. 2017.Acausal framework for explaining the predictions ofblack-box sequence-to-sequence models.In Pro-ceedings of the 2017 Conference on Empirical Meth-ods in Natural Language Processing, pages 412–421.Leila Arras, Franziska Horn, Gr´egoire Montavon,Klaus-Robert M¨uller, and Wojciech Samek. 2017.”what is relevant in a text document?”: An inter-pretable machine learning approach.

Fine-grained sentiment analysis with faithfulattention. arXiv preprint arXiv:1908.06870.AppendixADataset PreprocessingWe describe what, if any, additional processing weperform on a per-dataset basis. All datasets wereconverted to a uniﬁed format.MultiRC (Khashabi et al., 2018) We perform min-imal processing. We use the validation set as thetesting set for public release.Evidence Inference (Lehman et al., 2019) We per-form minimal processing. As not all of the pro-vided evidence spans come with offsets, we deleteany prompts that had no grounded evidence spans.Movie reviews (Zaidan and Eisner, 2008) We per-form minimal processing. We use the ninth fold asthe validation set, and collect annotations on thetenth fold for comprehensive evaluation.FEVER (Thorne et al., 2018) We perform substan-tial processing for FEVER - we delete the ”NotEnough Info” claim class, delete any claims withsupport in more than one document, and reparti-tion the validation set into a validation and a testset for this benchmark (using the test set wouldcompromise the information retrieval portion ofthe original FEVER task). We ensure that thereis no document overlap between train, validation,and test sets (we use Pearce (2005) to ensure this,as conceptually a claim may be supported by factsin more than one document). We ensure that thevalidation set contains the documents used to cre-ate the FEVER symmetric dataset (Schuster et al.,2019) (unfortunately, the documents used to createthe validation and test sets overlap so we cannotprovide this partitioning). Additionally, we cleanup some encoding errors in the dataset via Speer(2019).BoolQ (Clark et al., 2019) The BoolQ dataset re-quired substantial processing. The original datasetdid not retain source Wikipedia articles or col-lection dates.In order to identify the sourceparagraphs, we download the 12/20/18 Wikipediaarchive, and use FuzzyWuzzy https://github.com/seatgeek/fuzzywuzzy to identify the sourceparagraph span that best matches the original re-lease.

For CoS-Eand e-SNLI, the sentence counts are not meaningful as the partitioning of question/sentence/answer formatting isan arbitrary choice in this framework.\f4457or questions with rationales that were not possi-ble to automatically map back to the underlyingtext. As recommended by the authors of Talmoret al. (2019) we repartition the train and validationsets into a train, validation, and test set for thisbenchmark. We encode the entire question and an-swers as a prompt and convert the problem into aﬁve-class prediction. We also convert the “Sanity”datasets for user convenience.All datasets in ERASER were tokenized usingspaCy11 library (with SciSpacy (Neumann et al.,2019) for Evidence Inference). In addition, we alsosplit all datasets except e-SNLI and CoS-E intosentences using the same library.BAnnotation detailsWe collected comprehensive rationales for a subsetof some test sets to accurately evaluate model recallof rationales.1. Movies. We used the Upwork Platform12 tohire two ﬂuent english speakers to annotateeach of the 200 documents in our test set.Workers were paid at rate of USD 8.5 per hourand on average, it took them 5 min to anno-tate a document. Each annotator was asked toannotate a set of 6 documents and comparedagainst in-house annotations (by authors).2. Evidence Inference. We again used Upworkto hire 4 medical professionals ﬂuent in en-glish and having passed a pilot of 3 documents.125 documents were annotated (only once byone of the annotators, which we felt was ap-propriate given their high-level of expertise)with an average cost of USD 13 per document.Average time spent of single document was31 min.3. BoolQ. We used Amazon Mechanical Turk(MTurk) to collect reference comprehensiverationales from randomly selected 199 docu-ments from our test set (ranging in 800 to 1500tokens in length). Only workers from AU, NZ,CA, US, GB with more than 10K approvedHITs and an approval rate of greater than 98%were eligible. For every document, 3 annota-tions were collected and workers were paidUSD 1.50 per HIT. The average work time(obtained through MTurk interface) was 21min. We did not anticipate the task taking so11https://spacy.io/12http://www.upwork.comlong (on average); the effective low pay ratewas unintended.CHyperparameter and training detailsC.1(Lei et al., 2016) modelsFor these models, we set the sparsity rate at 0.01and we set the contiguity loss weight to 2 timessparsity rate (following the original paper). Weused bert-base-uncased (Wolf et al., 2019) as to-ken embedder (for all datasets except BoolQ, Ev-idence Inference and FEVER) and BidirectionalLSTM with 128 dimensional hidden state in eachdirection. A dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) rateof 0.2 was used before feeding the hidden repre-sentations to attention layer in decoder and linearlayer in encoder. One layer MLP with 128 dimen-sional hidden state and ReLU activation was usedto compute the decoder output distribution.For three datasets mentioned above, we useGloVe embeddings (http://nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.840B.300d.zip).A learning rate of 2e-5 with Adam (Kingma andBa, 2014) optimizer was used for all models and weonly ﬁne-tuned top two layers of BERT encoder.Th models were trained for 20 epochs and earlystopping with patience of 5 epochs was used. Thebest model was selected on validation set using theﬁnal task performance metric.The input for the above model was encodedin form of [CLS] document [SEP] query[SEP].ThismodelwasimplementedusingtheAllenNLP library (Gardner et al., 2018).C.2BERT-LSTM/GloVe-LSTMThis model is essentially the same as the decoder inprevious section. The BERT-LSTM uses the samehyperparameters, and GloVe-LSTM is trained witha learning rate of 1e-2.C.3Lehman et al. (2019) modelsWith the exception of the Evidence Inferencedataset, these models were trained using the GLoVe(Pennington et al., 2014) 200 dimension word vec-tors, and Evidence Inference using the (Pyysaloet al., 2013) PubMed word vectors. We use Adam(Kingma and Ba, 2014) with a learning rate of1e-3, Dropout (Srivastava et al., 2014) of 0.05 ateach layer (embedding, GRU, attention layer) ofthe model, for 50 epochs with a patience of 10. Wemonitor validation loss, and keep the best modelon the validation set.\f4458C.4BERT-to-BERT modelWe primarily used the ‘bert-base-uncased‘ modelfor both components of the identiﬁcation and clas-siﬁcation pipeline, with the sole exception beingEvidence Inference with SciBERT (Beltagy et al.,2019). We trained with the standard BERT parame-ters of a learning rate of 1e-5, Adam (Kingma andBa, 2014), for 10 epochs. We monitor validationloss, and keep the best model on the validation set.",
