{"question": "What training data were used for the models in this study?", "answer": "Common Crawl paragraphs of arbitrary length.", "type": "text-only", "evidence": "The text states \"Training examples for our model are Common Crawl paragraphs of arbitrary length.\""}
{"question": "Which training data size from the Common Crawl resulted in the highest average accuracy across all GLUE tasks?", "answer": "The 18,000 million tokens (M tok) training data size from the Common Crawl resulted in the highest average accuracy of 81.3 across all GLUE tasks.", "type": "multimodal-t", "evidence": "The question asks for the highest average accuracy across all GLUE tasks for a specific data size. This is found by examining the 'Avg' column and looking for the highest number in the 'ccrawl' section."}
{"question": "How does the CNN Base model's performance on the SST-2 task compare to the OpenAI GPT?", "answer": "The CNN Base model has an SST-2 score of 93.6, which is higher than OpenAI GPT's score of 91.3.", "type": "multimodal-t", "evidence": "Direct comparison between the SST-2 scores listed for each model shows that the CNN Base model outperforms OpenAI GPT on this specific task."}
{"question": "Which model has the highest test F1 score according to Table 4?", "answer": "The CNN Large with fine-tune model has the highest test F1 score of 95.6.", "type": "multimodal-t", "evidence": "This is a comparison question that requires examining all listed models to determine which one has the highest score in the test F1 column."}
{"question": "What loss function achieved the highest average performance according to Table 5?", "answer": "The cloze loss function achieved the highest average performance according to Table 5 with an average score of 80.9.", "type": "multimodal-t", "evidence": "The question asks to identify which loss function performed best on average, which can be answered by directly comparing the average scores in the last column of the table."}
{"question": "What is the purpose of the combination (comb) layers in Figure 2?", "answer": "The combination layers are used to merge different embeddings together to produce a final representation that can be used for a downstream task such as classification.", "type": "multimodal-f", "evidence": "The image shows that the embeddings of a, b, and c are each fed into a combination layer which suggests that their purpose is to combine these embeddings."}
{"question": "Are all authors from the same affilation?", "answer": "yes", "type": "meta-data", "evidence": ""}
{"question": "Where does the paper publish at?", "answer": "the 2019 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing and the 9th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing", "type": "meta-data", "evidence": ""}
