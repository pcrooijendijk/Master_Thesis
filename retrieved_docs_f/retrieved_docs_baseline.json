        "There has recently been a significant increase in the arrival of unaccompanied minors in the UK by small boat, and the government notes the majority are aged 16 and 17 years. Where the age of the individual is unclear, an age assessment is performed. The government reported in 2022 that half of those who underwent this assessment were found to be adults.   Unaccompanied minors, considered to be those under the age of 18 who are not with any family members, may make an application for asylum on their own behalf, and are typically put into the care of local authorities while these applications are being considered. Local authorities must treat them in the same manner as other \u201ccared for\u201d children in their area. This includes the provision of health services and education.    Due to the overarching principle of safeguarding and promoting the well-being of minors, a new immigration category, known as unaccompanied asylum-seeking child leave, was created for unaccompanied minors whose applications for asylum are refused and who are not eligible for any other forms of protection or leave, but who cannot be removed to their country of origin due to a lack of adequate reception facilities. This leave is temporary and allows the unaccompanied minors to stay in the UK until they turn 18 and there is no longer a requirement for adequate reception facilities in their country of return.    While unaccompanied minors may be detained for up to 24 hours, guidance from the government states detention is typically not used. Due to an increase in arrivals of unaccompanied minors, many are being housed in hotels while awaiting transfer to a local authority, which has caused concern, and a number of minors have been reported as missing.    Unaccompanied minors are entitled to a free legal representative, who helps them complete forms and is present during a substantive interview where their claim is considered.

        "There has recently been a significant increase in the arrival of unaccompanied minors in the UK by small boat, and the government notes the majority are aged 16 and 17 years. Where the age of the individual is unclear, an age assessment is performed. The government reported in 2022 that half of those who underwent this assessment were found to be adults.   Unaccompanied minors, considered to be those under the age of 18 who are not with any family members, may make an application for asylum on their own behalf, and are typically put into the care of local authorities while these applications are being considered. Local authorities must treat them in the same manner as other \u201ccared for\u201d children in their area. This includes the provision of health services and education.    Due to the overarching principle of safeguarding and promoting the well-being of minors, a new immigration category, known as unaccompanied asylum-seeking child leave, was created for unaccompanied minors whose applications for asylum are refused and who are not eligible for any other forms of protection or leave, but who cannot be removed to their country of origin due to a lack of adequate reception facilities. This leave is temporary and allows the unaccompanied minors to stay in the UK until they turn 18 and there is no longer a requirement for adequate reception facilities in their country of return.    While unaccompanied minors may be detained for up to 24 hours, guidance from the government states detention is typically not used. Due to an increase in arrivals of unaccompanied minors, many are being housed in hotels while awaiting transfer to a local authority, which has caused concern, and a number of minors have been reported as missing.

While driven by American values, these efforts represent a vital national security imperative. The absence of religious freedom weakens social cohesion and alienates citizens from their government, in turn fomenting inequality, resentment, and unrest. Conversely, expanding religious freedom and bundled rights (such as assembly, association, and expression) fosters political stability, economic growth, and human security, including here at home. In his March 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance (INSSG), President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. articulated this imperative: \u201c[L]eading the world isn\u2019t an investment we make to feel good about ourselves. It\u2019s how we ensure the American people are able to live in peace, security, and prosperity. It\u2019s in our undeniable self-interest...

        "of Human Rights and Article 18 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: that individuals are free to believe or not believe, to change their beliefs, speak about their beliefs, and to manifest their beliefs through teaching, practice, worship, and observance. While driven by American values, these efforts represent a vital national security imperative. The absence of religious freedom weakens social cohesion and alienates citizens from their government, in turn fomenting inequality, resentment, and unrest. Conversely, expanding religious freedom and bundled rights (such as assembly, association, and expression) fosters political stability, economic growth, and human security, including here at home. In his March 2021 Interim National Security Strategic Guidance (INSSG), President Joseph R. Biden, Jr. articulated this imperative: \u201c[L]eading the world isn\u2019t an investment we make to feel good about ourselves. It\u2019s how we ensure the American people are able to live in peace, security, and prosperity. It\u2019s in our undeniable self-interest...
