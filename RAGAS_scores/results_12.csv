The exact outcome depends on the specific circumstances, such as the nature of the property and the associated costs. Here's a structured summary of the potential consequences: 1. **Auction with Owners Paying Costs**: If the foreign national does not transfer their real estate rights, the property may be auctioned. The owners of the property would then have to pay the costs associated with the auction, which could include fees and expenses. 2. **Government Auction**: The government might hold an auction, with the owners of the property having to pay the costs. This process is formal and may involve multiple steps, including the involvement of various Ministries and the Council of Ministers. 3. **Exceptions and Special Cases**: If the property is inherited or if the foreign national is from a country that allows property ownership rights in Iran, there might be a different process. However, the question does not specify these conditions, so these scenarios are considered general. In conclusion, the consequences for a foreign national moving out of Iran without transferring real estate rights are likely to involve either an auction with the owners paying the costs or the government holding an auction, depending on the specific circumstances and associated costs.","If a foreign national changes their resident status and relocates outside Iran without transferring their real estate rights to an Iranian citizen within six months, the government will conduct an auction of the real estate and provide the sale proceeds to the foreign national or their heirs after expenses.",0.9999999999,0.90498014016881,0.8,1.0

While the exact nature of this change depends on the specific models and context, it's reasonable to consider the following possibilities: 1. **Overfitting vs. Generalization**: A stricter mask (higher \( p \)) might lead to overfitting, where the model becomes overly complex and fails to generalize well to unseen data. This could result in a lower AUC as the model's performance decreases on the training data. 2. **Conservativeness vs. Conservativeness**: A less stringent mask (lower \( p \)) might allow the models to perform better, as they are less likely to be influenced by noise or outliers. This could result in a higher AUC as the models generalize better. 3. **Trade-off Between Flexibility and Accuracy**: There might be a trade-off where an increase in \( p \) leads to a slight improvement in AUC, as the models become more flexible and better at capturing underlying patterns. Conversely, a stricter mask could lead to a decrease in AUC due to reduced generalization. 4. **Dataset and Feature Considerations**: The change in AUC could also be influenced by factors such as dataset size, class imbalance, and feature relevance. Without specific information on these aspects, it's challenging to determine the exact impact.

Following the US Supreme Court’s denial of certiorari in June 2020, the cases were remanded to the US Bankruptcy Court, where they are now pending.Fairfield Sentry Limited, Fairfield Sigma Limited and Fairfield Lambda Limited (together, ‘Fairfield’) (in liquidation since July 2009) have brought a lawsuit in the US against fund shareholders, including HSBC companies that acted as nominees for clients, seeking restitution of redemption payments. In December 2018, the US Bankruptcy Court issued an opinion, which ruled in favour of the defendants’ motion to dismiss in respect of certain claims by the liquidators for Fairfield and granted a motion by the liquidators to file amended complaints. As a result of that opinion, all claims against one of the HSBC companies, and certain claims against the remaining HSBC defendants, were dismissed. In May 2019, the liquidators appealed certain issues from the US Bankruptcy Court to the US District Court for the Southern District of New York (the ’New York District Court’) and, in January 2020, the liquidators filed amended complaints on the claims remaining in the US Bankruptcy Court.

18,Why are the results of BERT with a mean of 71.6% not considered meaningful?,"['BERT Sentence BERT (Reimers andGurevych, 2019) is a general-domain pretrainedmodel aimed at embedding sentences. The au-thors ﬁne-tuned BERT using a triplet loss, wherepositive sentences were from the same documentsection as the seed sentence, and distractor sen-tences came from other document sections. Themodel is designed to encode sentences as opposedto paragraphs, so we embed the title and each sen-tence in the abstract separately, sum the embed-dings, and L2 normalize the result to produce aﬁnal 768-dimensional paper embedding.18During hyperparameter optimization we chosehow to compute TF and IDF values weights bytaking the following non-redundant combinationsof scikit-learn’s TﬁdfVectorizer (Pedregosa et al.,2011) parameters: sublinear_tf, binary,use_idf, smooth_idf.There were a totalof 9 parameter combinations.The IDF valueswere estimated on the training set.The otherparameters were set as follows:min_df=3,max_df=0.75, strip_accents=’ascii’,stop_words=’english’,norm=None,lowercase=True. For training of fasttext, weused all default parameters with the exception ofsetting dimension to 300 and minCount was setto 25 due to the large corpus.18We used the ‘bert-base-wikipedia-sections-mean-tokens’model released by the authors: https://github.com/UKPLab/sentence-transformers']","The mean of 71.6% performance for BERT, while numerically low, may not be meaningful due to several factors: 1. **Metric Choice**: The mean might not be a reliable or meaningful metric for evaluating language models. Common metrics like ROUGE or BLEU are more appropriate as they assess text generation quality. 2. **Dataset Context**: The performance may be specific to the dataset used, not generalizable. Different tasks require models to handle varying nuances and contexts. 3. **Model Confidence**: BERT might be overconfident, leading to overestimated confidence scores, which can mislead about the model's actual performance. 4. **Task-Specificity**: The results might not be meaningful in the context of the specific task. For example, if the task requires coherent answers, the model's performance might not reflect true accuracy. 5. **Audience Impact**: The results might not be meaningful for the intended audience. For instance, in healthcare, a low mean might not reflect actual impact if the task is about accuracy. 6. **Statistical Significance**: Without context, it's unclear if the mean is statistically significant or just a random fluctuation. 7. **Comparison with Other Models**: If BERT isn't outperforming other models on the same task, its mean might not be meaningful in that specific context. In conclusion, the 71.6% mean may not be meaningful due to the lack of a reliable metric, context-specific performance, and potential overconfidence in the model's predictions.","The results are not considered meaningful because they include instances where BERT failed to train properly, resulting in degenerate results almost equivalent to random guessing, as observed in 5 out of 20 runs.",0.9999999999,0.0,0.0,1.0
