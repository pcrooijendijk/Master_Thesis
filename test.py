Discussion of CPEC has consistently been characterized by a major gap between the facts on the ground and how it is described. Even some of the best, and most thoughtful experts continue to use figures that have long lost their connection to reality. The BRI meta-narrative casts a long shadow over whichever specific case is being examined, whether it be lines drawn on maps across Asia, superlative numbers, dual-use ports, debt traps, and other tropes. In the case of Pakistan, some of these framings have been misleading. The “corridor” concept and transportation routes from Xinjiang to Gwadar have been a consistent, distracting focal point from the nature of the investments that have been made. Rumors of large-scale debt distress—which are founded in several other BRI cases—have not been fully borne out by the facts. There continues to be more interest on the part of many outside observers in potential dual-use facilities at a barely functional port than out-and-out military cooperation taking place in plain sight.139                                                      136 Downs, supra note 19, at 35. 137 Small, supra note 26, at 5. 138 Srijan Shukla, Two Phrases Critics of China’s BRI Must Not Use – Debt Trap & Threat to Sovereignty, The Print (May 1, 2019), https://perma.cc/H4FT-GLQJ.  139 Small, supra note 26, at 5. \x0cBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 118  Hambantota Port (Sri Lanka)  On the discussion of “debt trap” and BRI, the controversy surrounding the deep sea port of Hambontota in Sri Lanka is often mentioned.140 The story as commonly framed is that despite feasibility studies showing that the port was not financially viable, the Sri Lankan government took out loans with onerous terms to construct the port; it was unable to pay off the loans, which pushed'), 0.8081052899360657), (Document(id='56f8ea2b-e8fe-4502-ab38-b934ef824b9f', metadata={'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'trapped': '', 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'keywords': '', 'subject': ''}, page_content='order to close 1MDB’s financial gap that was created by his embezzlement.

For example, in Kenya, the China Road and Bridge Corporation was awarded the contract to build the SGR without open tendering, in disregard of the 2010 Constitution and 2005 Public Procurement and Disposal Act. Similarly, in Pakistan, there were reported irregularities violating procurement rules in the award for highways and motorways projects. In Malaysia, some of the projects and deals have generated controversy and have formed part of the corruption allegations against Najib Razak, the former prime minister who initiated them. A new prime minister sought to renegotiate or terminate some of the significant projects between 2018 and 2020, arguing that they imposed too great a burden on the country, and the former prime minister was subsequently convicted of corruption offenses in 2020. Concerns about potential violations of procurement processes, concessions in respect to local content, and fair labor practices have also been raised in a number of Caribbean countries.

Fears that Djibouti is caught in a debt trap could be mitigated by several factors, however. One is that Djibouti’s economic prospects are quite positive, even taking into account the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. Recent World Bank estimates predict that “output growth is set to reach 5.5% in 2021 and average 6.2% over 2022 and 2023, as free zone re-exports, as well as economic activity in, and exports of, transportation, logistics, and telecommunication services to Ethiopia rebound.”55 While Djibouti is vulnerable to knock-on effects of a more protracted economic slump in Ethiopia, its “ongoing infrastructure projects, such as the construction of a ship repair yard, a new oil jetty at the Port of Damerjog and a new hospitality infrastructure are also expected to                                                  48 Id. 49 Id. citing Styan, supra note 25.  50 Press Release No. 19/383, IMF, IMF Executive Board Concludes 2019 Article IV Consultation with Djibouti (Oct. 23, 2019), https://perma.cc/92TU-HLMF.  51 Joint World Bank-IMF Debt Sustainability Analysis, Int’l Dev.

Local job creation has been another area of controversy in BRI projects in a number of host countries. In Pakistan, CPEC is expected to add over 700,000 jobs to the Pakistani labor market from 2015 to 2030. Some commentators reported estimates exceeding 2.3 million jobs by 2030. However, it appears that a large portion of the jobs generated by these projects employ unskilled laborers while most skilled opportunities go to Chinese workers. Similarly, in Egypt, although Chinese companies are hiring local Egyptian workers, there is a concern that local employees are underrepresented in the companies’ managerial positions. This may deny the workers the opportunity to gain important knowledge and skills.   V.  Military or Strategic Purposes of Projects   Commentators have written about the potential and actual use of certain BRI-linked ports and other maritime assets for strategic and military purposes, but this is usually downplayed or rejected by the host country and China.

(See Part III.B below.)  5.  Sovereign Immunity Waiver  Kenya is said to have waived its sovereign immunity in the loan agreement, potentially exposing key public assets to seizure by China in the event of a default. According to a 2018 report by Kenya’s auditor general, the “[Kenya Port Authority] assets are exposed since the Authority signed the agreement where it has been referred to as a borrower under clause 17.5 and any proceeding against its assets by the lender would not be protected by sovereign immunity since the government waived the immunity on the Kenya port assets by signing the agreement.”117 The loan agreement is said to include a'), 0.840846061706543), (Document(id='c4a72dbe-0810-4cb3-94fc-37bfec8d0ea2', metadata={'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'keywords': '', 'trapped': '', 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'subject': '', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'format': 'PDF 1.6'}, page_content='have raised concerns about “inequitable distribution of CPEC projects and resources,” increased centralization of CPEC decision making, and lack of transparency over specific CPEC projects.

Local residents of Gwadar have shown opposition to CPEC over concern with its impact on livelihoods, fear of displacement, and whether they will “reap the fruits of Chinese investment.”154 More recently, in January 2021, Baluchistan government authorities shelved a controversial fencing plan around Gwadar that had drawn local protests and opposition.155 In 2020, government of Sindh province, led by the Pakistan Peoples Party, opposed156 a presidentially-promulgated Pakistan Islands Development Authority (PIDA) Ordinance157 that took direct control of two islands off the coast of the port city of Karachi “to facilitate reclamation and urban planning” and develop the islands'), 0.843902587890625), (Document(id='0e245c2a-1a0d-4eef-a937-4fec5a8d06a3', metadata={'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'trapped': '', 'keywords': '', 'subject': '', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074'}, page_content='any information affecting the nation.”47  2. Procurement Law The current law governing government procurement and asset disposal matters is the Public Procurement and Asset Disposal Act of 2015, which took effect in January 2016.48 Prior to that, including at the time the SGR deal was negotiated and signed, the applicable law was the Public Procurement and Disposal Act of 2005.49 The 2005 Act was at the center of the legal suit challenging the legality of the SGR deal (see part II(C) below).   The stated purpose of the 2005 Act included to “establish procedures for procurement,”  “increase transparency and accountability in those procedures,”  “increase public confidence in those procedures” and “facilitate the promotion of local industry and economic development.”50 It also required that government institutions use “open tendering” established under its provisions for each procurement.51 A clause on conflicts with international agreements stated that “[w]here any provision of this Act conflicts with any obligations of the Republic of Kenya arising from a treaty or other agreement to which Kenya is a party, this Act shall prevail except in instances of negotiated grants or loans.”52 A clause on conflicts with conditions on donated funds stated that “[i]f there is a conflict between this Act, the regulations or any directions of the Authority and a condition imposed by the donor of funds, the condition shall prevail with respect to a procurement that uses those funds and no others.”53 For discussion on the relevance of these provisions, see Part II(C) below.   The current version of the conflicts with international agreements clause states that “[s]ubject to the Constitution, where any provision of this Act conflicts with any obligations of the Republic of Kenya arising from a treaty, agreement or other convention ratified by Kenya and to which Kenya is party, the terms of the treaty or agreement shall prevail.”54  3.

Post-Concession Performance of Piraeus Container Operations  Under the management of COSCO, the PCT’s container capacity and container throughput increased rapidly. In 2008, before the concession, it was estimated that Pier II had a capacity of 1.6 million to 1.8 million TEU per annum, which could potentially be increased by 1 million TEU with appropriate technical upgrades, and that the development of Pier III could add a capacity of 1 million to 3.7 million TEU per annum.28 The actual container throughput of the entire port was estimated to be approximately 433,000 TEU in 2008.29 After the concession, PCT became Europe’s fastest-growing container terminal in terms of throughput, with its throughput increasing to 2.7 million TEU by 2012, and to 5.2 million TEU by 2019.30 In 2020, the throughput was 4.9 million TEU.31 It has been reported that, in 2019, €395 billion worth of Chinese goods were transshipped via Piraeus.32  On the other hand, the performance of Pier I, which was operated by OLP, remained relatively stagnant until after COSCO Shipping acquired a majority share in OLP in 2016. OLP is still operating the Pier I terminal. According to OLP financial reports, Pier I’s throughput was approximately 489,000 TEU in 2019 and 541,000 TEU in 2020, increasing from approximately 204,000 TEU in 2016, the year COSCO acquired its shares in OLP.33 The 2020 financial report ascribes the increase primarily to COSCO’s contribution in bringing in transshipment volume.34'), 0.860751748085022), (Document(id='73b92f8e-75f7-4f1e-8f21-932634728574', metadata={'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'trapped': '', 'subject': '', 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'keywords': '', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074'}, page_content='(Apr. 26, 2021), https://perma.cc/B8UM-N8UQ.  \x0cBelt and Road Initiative: Kenya The Law Library of Congress 52 2019.104 In 2020, the SGR reportedly carried 4.4 million tons of cargo.105 This was reportedly due in part to the fact that trucking remained a cheaper option.106  Also part of the challenge is the fact that Kenya does not operate the SGR. CRBC operates the SGR through its subsidiary, Africa Star Railway Operation Co. (AfriStar). (See Part III.B below.) The Kenyan government pays US$1 million per month to Afristar to operate the line and is said to have racked up US$380 million in unpaid bills to the company.107 Afristar’s operational costs have consistently come in higher than the revenue it generates. A government report noted that the line registered a loss of over US$200 million over three years, a loss that, due to the manner in which the financing is structured, taxpayers have to cover.108 This has made it difficult for Kenya to cover the operational cost and service its debt.109  Kenya sought to boost the amount of cargo transported through the SGR by requiring businesses to use the line. On March 15, 2019, the Kenya Port Authority (KPA) issued a directive “notifying the general public that from the date of the directive, shipping lines would not be allowed to endorse a Bill of lading to importers’ Container Freight Station (CFS) of choice.”110 On August 3, 2019, the KPA and the Kenya Revenue Authority issued another directive “stating that all imported cargo for delivery to Nairobi and the hinterland shall be conveyed by the Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) and cleared at the Inland Container Depot – Nairobi.”111 This led to a lawsuit challenging the legality and constitutionality of the directives before the Constitutional and Human Rights Division of the Kenya High Court at Mombasa and, on November 6, 2020, the Court found both directives unconstitutional and therefore void.112  A recent Parliamentary report on the use of the SGR also found that'), 0.8620436191558838), (Document(id='942e691c-6d0b-4328-886d-9e3dc79cc6c8', metadata={'trapped': '', 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'subject': '', 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'keywords': ''}, page_content='Mail (May 18, 2021), https://perma.cc/P5QH-KGGS; Khairah N.

These resources are vital to developments in Cambodia, particularly its infrastructure. For example, Cambodia needs US$26 billion to build expressways by 2040.15  Lastly, the BRI fits well with other existing frameworks and strategies that Cambodia is following. “The BRI is properly complementary to the existing connectivity cooperation frameworks and strategies, such as the Master Plan of ASEAN Connectivity 2025 (MPAC – 2025), Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) Work Plan III, the United Nations 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, and the Greater Mekong Subregion Infrastructure Connectivity 2015–2020 and its corridors.”16 Additionally, the BRI is consistent with Cambodia’s development plans, such as Cambodia’s National Strategic Development Plan (2014–2018) and Industrial Development Policy (2015–2025).

Cambodia’s Ream Naval Base, on the Gulf of Thailand, predates the BRI. It is suspected that Cambodia and China have signed a secret agreement concerning the base. Although the details are not clear due to the confidential nature of the agreement, based on an earlier draft of the agreement that was seen by US officials, the United States and its allies suspect it would allow “China to use the base for 30 years, with automatic renewals for every 10 years after that,” and “to post military personnel, store weapons and berth warships.”60   The military installation in question covers 190 acres and once included two facilities built with US funding and one pier. It was reported that Cambodia requested but later refused funding from the United States to improve the military facilities. However, recent satellite images show that an area in the military base in question has been “cleared in apparent preparation for construction work.”61 The images also indicate that the US-funded facilities have been demolished.62'), 0.869432806968689), (Document(id='32684bc6-6843-42f0-8763-a653c60baece', metadata={'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'keywords': '', 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'trapped': '', 'subject': '', 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative'}, page_content='line, at an additional cost of US$239 million.93 A similar project in Tanzania (with one major exception in that the Tanzania system is electrified) built by a Turkish company that had won the contract in an open and competitive bid was said to have been built at a significantly lower cost.94  3.

On 15 April 2019, about two weeks before the BRF took place in Beijing, Mahathir’s office announced that it had successfully re-negotiated the terms of the ECRL project with CCCC (PMO, 2019). Among other changes, the construction cost was reduced from 55 billion to 44 billion Malaysian ringgits. In addition to reducing the principal repayment amount, this would also lighten the financing interest payment. The railway track was also re-routed, passing through five states (Negri Sembilan added to Pahang, Terengganu, Kelantan, and Selangor) and Putrajaya rather than the previous four states, allowing more states to access the economic benefits of the improved deal. For CCCC, while it has been retained as the main contractor, it now has a longer-term stake in the project after agreeing to participate in the operation and maintenance of the ECRL through a 50/50 joint venture arrangement \x0cBelt and Road Initiative: Malaysia The Law Library of Congress 92 with the Malaysians. CCCC also signed a memorandum of understanding to develop industrial parks along the railway aiming to transform the transport corridor into an economic corridor. This agreement, when realised, involves the establishment of logistics hubs at transport interchanges to promote connectivity and transportation of goods, and transit-oriented development stations to promote new development and to support the growth of industrial parks (Zainul, 2019).84  As also noted above, the contract with CCCC was further revised by the current PN government, with an agreement for “ECRL 3.0” reached in March 2021.

This included eight government-to-government MOUs signed in 2015 and 14 MOUs signed in November 2016 during an official visit by the then-prime minister of Malaysia, Najib Razak. At the end of that visit, a joint press statement stated that “Malaysia highly valued its place as one of the important countries under the Silk Road Economic Belt and 21st Century Maritime Silk Road (Belt and Road) Initiative proposed by the Chinese government in 2013.”3  Between 2018 and 2020, following the election of a new coalition government (Pakatan Harapan, PH) led by Mahathir Mohamad, which replaced the previous coalition (Barisan Nasional, BN) led by the United Malays National Organisation (UMNO) party that had been in power in some form for 60 years, Malaysia sought to renegotiate some of the BRI-related infrastructure development deals with China. This came amid a corruption scandal involving former prime minister Najib, which included allegations that the cost of certain BRI projects had been inflated in order to bail out the state-owned investment fund 1Malaysia Development Berhard (1MDB), from which Najib was accused of misappropriating funds. According to one author,  [t]here are numerous indications that Najib concluded very unfavourable deals with Beijing amounting to at least USD 34 billion in order to close 1MDB’s financial gap that was created by his embezzlement. Some observers say these deals aided and abetted money laundering.4  Najib was convicted of corruption offenses related to the 1MDB scandal in July 2020 and sentenced to imprisonment for 12 years.

Sihanoukville  A reporter concludes that the Sihanoukville development by BRI brought many Chinese wealth, but many local Cambodians “are being driven out by the skyrocketing cost of living” although some, especially those who own land, are benefiting from it.74 Another complaint by residents is that “even though Chinese investment brings wealth, it is mainly kept within their own community. Chinese residents and visitors buy from Chinese businesses and visit Chinese restaurants and hotels, ensuring the trickle-down effect is minimal.”75   The increase in casino gambling in Sihanoukville has brought with it organized crime. Chinese investors risk being kidnapped.76 In addition, Cambodia’s immigration authority has found many Chinese are working in Sihanoukville without work permits.77 To curb the crimes, the Cambodian government banned online and arcade gambling beginning January 1, 2020. The immigration office announced that 400,000 Chinese left by the end of 2019 because of the ban.78 According to an article, a labor ministry official told local media outlets “[a]lmost 30 casinos in Sihanoukville have closed or suspended employment of all staff except security guards, and another 33 have temporarily suspended staff.”79 Many Chinese workers were left behind in Sihanoukville without pay by their former employers, and Cambodians also lost jobs.80'), 0.8787710666656494), (Document(id='a9ff1a9b-4344-4ddd-b109-99046ac2822c', metadata={'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'subject': '', 'trapped': '', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'keywords': '', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074'}, page_content='Jones, Shahar Hameiri, Chatam House, Debunking the Myth of ‘Debt-trap Diplomacy’ How Recipient Countries Shape China’s Belt and Road Initiative 8 (Aug. 2020), https://perma.cc/6FSX-CWHA.  130 Id. at 9.  131 Id. 132 Id. 133 Id. at 11.  134 Id. 135 Id. \x0cBelt and Road Initiative: Pakistan The Law Library of Congress 117 One report also notes that China has also established a “track record of waiving or restructuring loans without taking control of assets.”136   A report published by the Center of Asian Law states:   [w]hile CPEC will not be the game-changer for the Pakistani economy that its supporters once hailed, it is not a debt trap either.

Chheang Vannarith, president of the Asian Vision Institute, expressed hope that the economic opportunities the BRI will provide to Cambodia outweigh the debt trap risks that others are concerned about.84 Further, political analyst Lao Mong Hay has claimed that most BRI projects in Cambodia are BOT projects, and thus, Cambodia should not incur any debt.85    C.

The Tianjin Economic-Technological Development Area (TEDA), a Chinese corporation, has established the China-Egypt Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone with the Egyptian government. The company has increased the number of its development projects and tenant factories in the Ain Sokhna district of the Suez Canal Corridor east of Cairo. Furthermore, TEDA is developing a 7.23 square kilometers industrial zone at Ain Sokhna. It has completed its first phase, attracting some 68 enterprises, including Jushi, a “fiberglass giant” from China.23  In 2018, another Chinese company, called “Harbour Excavation” contributed to the development of the Suez Canal by constructing a container terminal in the Port of Damietta, north of the canal.

Those investment projects are supposed to take place in the Suez Canal Economic Zone and create 20,000 jobs.25  By the end of 2020, the China–Egypt Suez Economic and Trade Cooperation Zone had attracted 96 enterprises and investment of more than US$1.25 billion.

This body will not replace the JCC but reportedly will be responsible for ’day-to-day monitoring of [the] CPEC.’”52  III.  Major CPEC Projects    This part will highlight certain CPEC projects and debt-related issues that have engendered discussion in policy and scholarly circles regarding Pakistan’s debt sustainability in relation to the BRI.  The exact financial structures and terms of various project arrangements are unclear, and information is dependent mostly on secondary sources. Generally, projects under CPEC are financed with a “mix of grants, long-term government concessional loans, zero interest loans and simple partnership or investment mode.”53 These four types of “financing instruments” under CPEC can be summarized as follows:   The first type is called “Investment” where the Chinese firms that are undertaking the infrastructure projects borrow commercial loans with an interest rate between 4-5% The second category is called “Concessional Loans” which are given to the Government of Pakistan at an interest rate of 2-2.5% with a maturity period of 25-30 years. The third category is called “Interest-free loans” which constitute a small proportion'), 0.8859384059906006), (Document(id='66ee5559-5410-4c85-b8a2-4506777ee7f0', metadata={'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'trapped': '', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'keywords': '', 'subject': ''}, page_content='on the part of China. Although the debt financing arrangements for CPEC power sector projects primarily involve loans from Chinese banks to project companies wholly or partly owned by Chinese firms, these projects may increase Pakistan’s debt because of sovereign guarantees issued by Islamabad to support CPEC power projects and the liquidity crisis in Pakistan’s power sector known as circular debt. That said, several aspects of the China-Pakistan relationship and the large stake that China’s government and companies have in the success of CPEC indicate that Chinese interests are better served by sustainable CPEC projects than unsustainable ones.122  Other observers, including the current Pakistani government, describe the “debt trap” narrative as a false, misleading, or simplistic assessment. Advocates of CPEC, including the Pakistani government, have described it as an economic “game changer” and a “win-win project of China-Pakistan economic cooperation.”123 Both governments describe characterizations of CPEC as a “debt trap” as “devoid of facts” and hold that not enough attention is drawn to the mutual economic benefits to both countries and the region.124 One paper highlights some of these economic and trade benefits to Pakistan:  The benefits that Pakistan is likely to gain from CPEC include upgrading of the road and deep-water port infrastructure, an enhanced capacity for energy production and a boost in manufacturing activity due to the SEZs. Moreover, there are opportunities for technology transfer in the manufacturing sector of Pakistan through foreign direct investment (FDI) or through collaborative arrangements. Also, the initiative provides an opportunity to position Pakistan as a major transit point connecting the Eurasian region with South Asia and Southeast Asia, which is much needed for the country’s economic growth.

Labor Issues  It appears that COSCO faced occasional opposition from labor groups since the beginning of its involvement in the Port of Piraeus. Before the concession of 2008, the civil service personnel and the dockhands working on Pier II appear to have been fully unionized, and they were apprehensive about potential loss of the jobs, overtime pay, and advantageous salary structures that a number of workers reportedly enjoyed (presumably based on legacy contracts from the time the port was under state management).35   The concession agreement appears to have included no provision regarding labor practices, other than the obligation to retain the existing workers of Pier II for the first 18 months of the concession.36 It has been reported that COSCO insisted on a pier “clean” of machinery but also workers, and that OLP received the displaced workers after they were made redundant by the PCT.37 PCT was reported to have directly hired a few hundred Greek personnel while not importing Chinese labor other than a few managerial level staff, and most of the labor appears to have been supplied by third-party subcontractors that hired workers on short-term contracts who were employed by PCT on an ”on call” basis.38'), 0.892853856086731), (Document(id='68e92336-705d-4249-9765-692ea2669932', metadata={'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'trapped': '', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'keywords': '', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'subject': '', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074'}, page_content='for the Multan-Sukkur Motorway project granted by the National Highway Authority (NHA) to a Chinese state-owned corporation, China State Construction Engineering Corporation (CSCEC).

I think we should put everything on hold for a year so we can get our act together. Perhaps we can stretch CPEC out over another five years or so.”22  This interview saw pushback from the Chinese government and from Pakistan’s military, which tried to repair relations. Since 2019, after projects began to stall, Pakistan’s government has sought to revive CPEC.23 In late December 2020, the Chinese and Pakistan governments held a meeting through a Joint Working Group on International Cooperation on CPEC, during which they proclaimed that both sides “are satisfied with the progress and committed to turn this mega project into a role model for the rest of the world to follow.”24  Some experts believe the “revival” is more “a slimmed-down package” and that ”[g]oing forward, CPEC instead will comprise smaller projects with less potential economic impact.”25 One report notes that in the coming years, CPEC’s agenda will “largely be focused on completing investments that have already been agreed (including around Gwadar port), moving ahead'), 0.8948938846588135), (Document(id='69af5fd6-6479-4a7b-8869-3d782b7d7a68', metadata={'modDate': "D:20210823095547-04'00'", 'format': 'PDF 1.6', 'author': 'Law Library of Congress', 'creator': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'trapped': '', 'subject': '', 'producer': 'Adobe Acrobat Pro DC 20.13.20074', 'title': 'Belt and Road Initiative', 'creationDate': "D:20210806164525-04'00'", 'keywords': ''}, page_content='apparent success of COSCO investments in Piraeus appears to have attracted the interest of Chinese enterprises in other FDI opportunities in various sectors in Greece.

Chinese Foreign Direct Investment in Greece  While Chinese foreign direct investment (FDI) in Europe is mainly in the larger European economies (in particular, the United Kingdom, Germany, France, and Italy), it appears that Greece and several Balkan countries have received the bulk of the Chinese investments that are specifically within the scope of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), which was officially launched in 2013.1   Chinese seaport investments in Greece is a subject of major importance for observers of the Chinese Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) due to its commercial and possibly strategic implications. Since 2008, the Chinese state-owned enterprise COSCO Shipping (COSCO) and its subsidiaries have won concessions and made acquisitions that enabled COSCO to be the controlling actor in the operation of Greece’s largest commercial port, the Port of Piraeus, until at least the year 2047. COSCO, which among its subsidiaries has China’s largest container shipping company, has made particularly significant investments in the development of the container terminals in the port, making it one of Europe’s fastest-growing major container ports since 2008 and Europe’s fourth                                                  1 Philippe Le Corre, China’s BRI: Implications for Europe, in US-China Foreign Relations: Power Transition and Its'), 0.8955463171005249)]
