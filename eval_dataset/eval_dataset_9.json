With just a single glance, its styling invites you to get in and go for a drive.And, this is the most compact SUV in the series—a small battery EV with a comfortable interior designed with Europe and Japan in mind.The more batteries you add to extend cruising range, the bigger, heavier, and more expensive a vehicle becomes. Because this SUV is a small vehicle, there is something we must be thorough and very particu-lar about—power efficiency.The important thing is determining to what degree we can increase a vehicle’s overall energy efficiency, in other words how much less energy a vehicle needs to run. This is exactly the technology that Toyota has been refining for more than 30 years.Putting our best efforts into addressing all aspects of this question, with this vehicle, we are aiming for a power efficiency of 125 watt-hours per kilometer, which would be the highest efficiency rate in the compact SUV class.The next model is a midsize sedan that meets customers’ expectations for a first car.We also have a large SUV with an optional third row of seats that facilitates families experiencing fulfilling times together.What do you think?

Jointly developing it with Subaru enabled us to pursue smoothness and maneuverability as well as the drivability of a genuine SUV.For its launch next year, we are preparing for the production of the bZ4X at Toyota’s Motomachi Plant right this very moment. We will soon begin delivering it to our customers.Furthermore, we are expanding the bZ series lineup.This midsize SUV has a beautiful silhouette that presages a new era for battery EVs. With just a single glance, its styling invites you to get in and go for a drive.And, this is the most compact SUV in the series—a small battery EV with a comfortable interior designed with Europe and Japan in mind.The more batteries you add to extend cruising range, the bigger, heavier, and more expensive a vehicle becomes. Because this SUV is a small vehicle, there is something we must be thorough and very particu-lar about—power efficiency.The important thing is determining to what degree we can increase a vehicle’s overall energy efficiency, in other words how much less energy a vehicle needs to run. This is exactly the technology that Toyota has been refining for more than 30 years.Putting our best efforts into addressing all aspects of this question, with this vehicle, we are aiming for a power efficiency of 125 watt-hours per kilometer, which would be the highest efficiency rate in the compact SUV class.The next model is a midsize sedan that meets customers’ expectations for a first car.We also have a large SUV with an optional third row of seats that facilitates families experiencing fulfilling times together.What do you think? We will not only add battery EV options to existing vehicle models but will also offer a full lineup of reasonably priced mass-production models, such as the bZ series, to meet the needs of all kinds of customers.By doing so, we hope to deliver to customers around the world the unique and beautiful"

I at 1426, https://perma.cc/7QQT-HDEU.  \f The Law Library of Congress 49 Israel Ruth Levush Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY The production, import, and marketing of cosmetic products require both a general cosmetic license as well as a license for the specific cosmetic product involved under Israeli law. The production and export of a cosmetic product that is intended exclusively for export, however, requires only a general cosmetic license. A license for a specific cosmetic product requires submission of a certificate from the director of the Institute of Standards and Control of Medical Materials, Ministry of Health, indicating that the specific cosmetic product has been tested.    The distribution of a cosmetic product in Israel generally requires that it first be subject to a professional safety assessment and that an updated safety report be prepared in relation to the product’s contents and the manner in which the safety assessment was conducted, ways in which it can be updated, and the competency required to perform it. Specific sensitivity tests are required for “dedicated cosmetic products.” Cosmetic products may only be stored at a location licensed for manufacturing and marketing cosmetics or at a drug store.    Self-regulation and supervision requirements have been proposed by the Ministry of Health. Adverse event reporting is similarly proposed in draft regulations. The Ministry’s website enables online reporting of side effects, though such reporting does not appear to be mandatory as of now. Detailed labeling requirements apply to cosmetic products, including a mandatory duty to identify nanoparticles in the product’s ingredients list on the label.

Let me break this down step by step.\n\nFirst, I remember from the context that the Law Library of Congress has a document titled \"The Law Library of Congress 49 Israel Ruth Levush Senior Foreign Law Specialist The production, import, and marketing of cosmetic products require both a general cosmetic license as well as a license for the specific cosmetic product involved under Israeli law. The production and export of a cosmetic product that is intended exclusively for export, however, requires only a general cosmetic license.

This specific license involves submission of a certificate from the director of the Institute of Standards and Control of Medical Materials, Ministry of Health, indicating that the specific cosmetic product has been tested. Additionally, the product must undergo a professional safety assessment and an updated safety report must be prepared in relation to the product’s contents and the manner in which the safety assessment was conducted, ways in which it can be updated, and the competency required to perform it.

I at 1426, https://perma.cc/7QQT-HDEU.  \f The Law Library of Congress 49 Israel Ruth Levush Senior Foreign Law Specialist   SUMMARY The production, import, and marketing of cosmetic products require both a general cosmetic license as well as a license for the specific cosmetic product involved under Israeli law. The production and export of a cosmetic product that is intended exclusively for export, however, requires only a general cosmetic license. A license for a specific cosmetic product requires submission of a certificate from the director of the Institute of Standards and Control of Medical Materials, Ministry of Health, indicating that the specific cosmetic product has been tested.    The distribution of a cosmetic product in Israel generally requires that it first be subject to a professional safety assessment and that an updated safety report be prepared in relation to the product’s contents and the manner in which the safety assessment was conducted, ways in which it can be updated, and the competency required to perform it. Specific sensitivity tests are required for “dedicated cosmetic products.” Cosmetic products may only be stored at a location licensed for manufacturing and marketing cosmetics or at a drug store.    Self-regulation and supervision requirements have been proposed by the Ministry of Health. Adverse event reporting is similarly proposed in draft regulations. The Ministry’s website enables online reporting of side effects, though such reporting does not appear to be mandatory as of now. Detailed labeling requirements apply to cosmetic products, including a mandatory duty to identify nanoparticles in the product’s ingredients list on the label.    A sharp increase in requests for the export of cosmetic products to the US was reported in 2016-2017, with an increasing number of small cosmetic firms entering the cosmetics and toiletries sector.

Mining and the sale of tokens are in general not activities that require authorization from the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority.    The German federal ministry of finance, in guidance issued in 2018, held that bitcoin mining is a nontaxable transaction under value-added tax law. With regard to the income tax treatment of mining, the federal minister of finance and the tax authorities of the German states are currently discussing that issue, and respective guidance will be published once an agreement has been reached. In December 2017, then-Parliamentary State Secretary in the Federal Ministry of Finance Michael Meister stated that occasionally performed mining could qualify as “other income” within the meaning of the Income Tax Act, which is only taxable if it exceeds 256 Euros (about US$310) in a calendar year.

MLQA is a multi-wayparallel extractive QA evaluation benchmark inseven languages: English, Arabic, German, Viet-namese, Spanish, SimpliÔ¨Åed Chinese and Hindi. Toconstruct MLQA, we Ô¨Årst automatically identifysentences from Wikipedia articles which have thesame or similar meaning in multiple languages. We\f7316extract the paragraphs that contain such sentences,then crowd-source questions on the English para-graphs, making sure the answer is in the alignedsentence. This makes it possible to answer the ques-tion in all languages in the vast majority of cases.2The generated questions are then translated to alltarget languages by professional translators, andanswer spans are annotated in the aligned contextsfor the target languages.The resulting corpus has between 5,000 and6,000 instances in each language, and more than12,000 in English. Each instance has an alignedequivalent in multiple other languages (always in-cluding English), the majority being 4-way aligned.Combined, there are over 46,000 QA annotations.We deÔ¨Åne two tasks to assess performance onMLQA.

The main reasoncould be that code2seq makes use of compositionalpaths in its abstract syntax tree (AST) while Code-BERT only takes original code as the input. Wehave trained a version of CodeBERT by traversingthe tree structure of AST following a certain order,but applying that model does not bring improve-ments on generation tasks. This shows a potentialdirection to improve CodeBERT by incorporatingAST.5ConclusionIn this paper, we present CodeBERT, which to thebest of our knowledge is the ﬁrst large bimodalpre-trained model for natural language and pro-gramming language. We train CodeBERT on bothbimodal and unimodal data, and show that ﬁne-tuning CodeBERT achieves state-of-the-art perfor-mance on downstream tasks including natural lan-guage code search and code-to-documentation gen-eration. To further investigate the knowledge em-bodied in pre-trained models, we formulate the taskof NL-PL probing and create a dataset for probing.We regard the probing task as a cloze-style answerselection problem, and curate distractors for bothNL and PL parts.

If there are further aspects of the dossier requiring clar-ification, the CHMP will issue further questions at Day 180, and may also request an oral explanation, in which case the sponsor must not only respond to the further questions but also appear before the committee to jus-tify its responses. On Day 210, the CHMP will take a vote to recommend the approval or non‑approval of the appli-cation, and their opinion is transferred to the EC. The final EC decision under this centralized procedure is a single decision that is applicable to all member states. This decision occurs 60 days, on average, after a posi-tive CHMP recommendation.Under both the mutual recognition procedure (MRP) and the decentralized procedure (DCP), the assessment is led by one member state, called the reference mem-ber state (RMS) which then liaises with other member states, known as the concerned member states. In the MRP, the company first obtains a marketing authoriza-tion in the RMS, which is then recognized by the con-cerned member states in 90 days. In the DCP, the appli-cation is done simultaneously in the RMS and all concerned member states. During the DCP, the RMS drafts an assessment report within 120 days."
